She is 58 years old, married and mother of 7 children. Five of her children are adults and the younger, who are attending school, are 14 and 12 years old. She has not studied because she had no conditions to do so since she lost her parents when she was still a child. She lives in her own house and, beyond her children, she supports her grandchildren who live with her. \r\n<p>\r\nShe left Namaacha to Boane when she got married, in 1967. She is a trader, and owns her business for 7 years. She works from 12:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. In the mornings, she has been working at the family's vegetable garden with her husband. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has learned to do business by herself, because of financial difficulties she was facing in the past. Her weekly earnings are of MZN 750.00 and, beyond that, she earns a monthly pension of MZN 4,250.00, which totals MZN 7,250 of monthly earnings. She is able to save some money in her bank account. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has worked with another financial institution before, called Tchuma, where she got a loan of MZN 3,500.00 which was applied to agricultural activity. This is her third loan with Hluvuku, of MZN 20,000.00, with which she intends to buy construction materials (beams, zinc sheets, cement, sand, stones and iron) in order to improve her house conditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHer first loans were of MZN 6,000.00 and MZN 12,000.00, both applied to agriculture. She pledges to repay well this loan in order to have access to new ones so that she can conclude her construction and furnish her house. \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Giovanna Fernandes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":699.89,"image":{"id":423858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Buy construction materials (cement, iron, zinc sheets and others) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-11-13T23:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":908.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":945.71},{"due_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":984.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1025.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1067.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.02},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1156.68},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1204.21},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1253.7},{"due_date":"2010-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1305.22},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1358.86},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1414.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1472.85},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1533.37},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1596.39},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1662.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.79},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.1},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.48},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.15},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.68},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.56},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":180.59,"local_amount":5159.82,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5291.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709052,"comment":null},{"amount":70.14,"local_amount":2003.88,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2054.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938323,"comment":null},{"amount":81.63,"local_amount":2332.3,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-20T08:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2391.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938324,"comment":null},{"amount":93.29,"local_amount":2668.55,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-16T08:11:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2736.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"payment_id":128972041,"comment":null},{"amount":93.73,"local_amount":2677.99,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2746.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698627,"comment":null},{"amount":180.51,"local_amount":5157.46,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5288.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916068,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-17T22:01:40Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":151300,"name":"Dagvadorj","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dagvadorj O. is 32 years old and lives with her husband and three children in Arhangai province in central Mongolia.

The group knew how to handle the situation by helping the members to make their payments while they were recuperating.  Then they could return to getting together their working capital, thus demonstrating the unity and solidarity of the group.\r\n\r\nThe group has different commercial activities like selling food, cosmetics, groceries in neighborhood stores, and medical supplies.  Some offer nursing and cleaning services.\r\n\r\nAs far as the competition goes, it is high.

These active and enterprising people desire to perform activities to bring them closer together and therefore become more united as a group.  The main activity of all of the partners is the sale of products, such as food, dairy products, shampoo, and cosmetics.  Additionally, the majority of our partners work in the construction of homes.  In regard to the competitive environment, we can mention that although competitors are present in their neighborhood, our partners have faithful clients that constantly generate the necessary economic activity for the subsistence of their families.  In the case that things are not going well for them in their neighborhood, they direct themselves to another place or diversify their economic activity in a way that they are able to fulfill their childrens' needs.  This credit will be used for the purchase of merchandise in Desaguadero and the acquisition of materials and tools that will help them generate better products and greater earnings in order to provide their families a higher quality of life.

Their principal goal is to achieve a greater volume of sales and therefore obtain greater earnings to support their families.  In regard in the competitive environment, we can mention that although competition exists in their neighborhood, our partners have faithful clients that consistently generate the necessary economic activity for the subsistence of their families.  In the case that things are not going well for them in their neighborhood, they may move to another place or diversify their economic activity in a way that they can fulfill their childrens' needs.  This credit will be used for the purchase of merchandise and the acquisition of materials and tools that will help them generate better products and greater earnings to be able to provide their families a higher quality of life.  As for experience with credit, our partners have received financing from similar institutions, but this is the first time they have worked with an institution that provides them with confidence and

This region is primarily known for its production of corn, beans, potatoes, and other crops. It also has tourist attractions, such as the archeological sites in Gullanzhapa and Pedernales. The people are very friendly and kind to domestic and foreign tourists.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Luz Mar\u00eda C. is a member of the Heart of Jesus Communal Bank.  She lives in the community of Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas in El Valle Parrish.  She is 56 years old and has been widowed for 15 years as a result of her husband\u2019s alcoholism.  Her five children range in age from 12 to 35.  The four oldest children are married and have their own families.  The youngest child is a student at Benigno Malo High School, but he does not live at home.  Instead, he stays at the home of her nephew.  \r\n<p>\r\nLuz told us that she previously worked preparing stucco but she started developing spinal problems.  This forced her to spend her time doing housework and raising chickens and guinea pigs.  Some of the animals are reserved for personal consumption, but most of them are sold to neighbors in the community or at the local markets.  \r\n<p>\r\nLuz has been working with the Institution for two years and used her previous loans to buy chickens and guinea pigs for breeding.  With this new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she will buy feed and vitamins for her animals.  A portion of the loan will be used to pay for some household expenses.  Luz dreams of owning a home.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":423325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase feed & vitamins for her animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-11-12T06:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Luz Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":73.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789450,"comment":null},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":74.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789451,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679920,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679921,"comment":null},{"amount":272.74,"local_amount":266.68,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":272.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074472,"comment":null},{"amount":114.55,"local_amount":112,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":114.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910471,"comment":null},{"amount":62.69,"local_amount":61.3,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":62.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946082,"comment":null},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":74.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946083,"comment":null},{"amount":75.04,"local_amount":73.37,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":75.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674477,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-17T01:11:54Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":151332,"name":"Stefany","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Stefany trabaja como secretaria en una cl\u00ednica es independiente y la \u00fanica que solventa sus gastos \nVive en la zona de miraflores de la Ciudad de La Paz, en casa alquilada.\nEl cr\u00e9dito ser\u00e1 destinado para capital de inversi\u00f3n compra edredones y ropa para dar a cr\u00e9dito.\nEs segunda vez que solicita un cr\u00e9dito en Impro, las ganas de superarse le dan la oportunidad de obtener este cr\u00e9dito.\n","en":"Stefany works as a secretary at a clinic, is independent and responsible for her own expenses.

La mayor\u00eda de las socias tiene su propio negocio como por ejemplo su presidenta se dedica a la recolecci\u00f3n de chatarra para reciclarla y volverla a vender, el resto de las socias se dedican a la venta de zapatos, comida, rellenos, verduras, ropa de bebe y al transporte. La existencia de la competencia en el mercado es grande pero depende de cada una como salir adelante ya que de los ingresos diarios subsiste su familia. El destino del financiamiento es para incrementar su capital de trabajo con la adquisici\u00f3n de mercader\u00edas, insumos y herramientas para incrementar sus ventas y generar un mejor ingreso para brindarles a sus familias una mejor calidad de vida, as\u00ed como un futuro m\u00e1s prometedor para sus hijos que son su raz\u00f3n de vivir. En cuanto a la experiencia  en la competencia crediticia los socios cuentan con ella gracias a financiamientos en instituciones similares pero es la primera vez que trabajan con una instituci\u00f3n que les brinda confianza y apoyo econ\u00f3mico, es por esta raz\u00f3n que desean seguir creciendo junto a nosotros. ","en":"\r\n\r\nThe \"Los Pulpitos\" (Little Octopi) group is made up of 12 members from the same neighborhood who have known each other for a long time and have complete confidence in each other; they are represented by Pastora.  Most of the members have their own businesses.  For example, the group president salvages junk to recyle and resell.  The rest of the members sell shoes, food, turnovers, vegetables, baby clothes, and provide transportation.  There is a lot of competition in the marketplace but it is up to each one to find a way to get ahead since these daily funds are what provide for their families' survival.  The funds will be used to increase working capital to buy merchandise, raw materials, and tools to increase sales and generate increased profits to provide their families with a better quality of life as well as a more promising future for their children, who are their reason to live.  As far as their competence with regard to credit, the members have it thanks to loans they have managed from similar instittions although this is the first time they have worked with an institution that offers them trust and economic support; for this reason they wish to continue growing with us.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3375,"image":{"id":423930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T07:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pastora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fidelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23500,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2230.87},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2256.54},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2282.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2308.77},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2335.34},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2362.21},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2389.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2416.88},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2444.7},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2472.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":320.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":324.08},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.8},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.58},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":335.4},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":339.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":343.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":347.1},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":351.1},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":355.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":972.27,"local_amount":6769.91,"processed_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6776.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678796,"comment":null},{"amount":331.58,"local_amount":2308.77,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2311.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678797,"comment":null},{"amount":335.4,"local_amount":2335.34,"processed_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2337.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678798,"comment":null},{"amount":339.25,"local_amount":2362.21,"processed_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2364.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073284,"comment":null},{"amount":343.16,"local_amount":2389.39,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2391.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073285,"comment":null},{"amount":347.1,"local_amount":2416.88,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2419.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909168,"comment":null},{"amount":351.1,"local_amount":2444.7,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2447.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909169,"comment":null},{"amount":355.14,"local_amount":2472.8,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2475.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128944721,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-24T21:31:22Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":151349,"name":"Mansour","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mansour is a 27-year-old married man with one child.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

When he started working he was a shop helper with a low salary, but with a lot of desire to learn, this would be useful in the future to start his own shop, which until now has been able to maintain because sales are low, wood is expensive and he has slow moving products in storage, as a result, he is not generating much cash.  What helps is the small store where he sells clothing, basic grains, cosmetics, he also knows  mechanics which has helped him get ahead to cover the basic family expenses, because the lack of rain, the low sales and inflation have contributed to make the economy of the country unstable.

She married young and has a 14 year old son, who is in school. She started a small mobile business selling fruits and vegetables, and with her husband's help, she was able to set up a small shop, which she has been running for 3 years. She also sells firewood, which her husband cuts down on their land. He is a farmer and rents land to cultivate. He grows beans and tomatoes and with this he supports and helps his family with their needs. Because of a lack of capital, they have not been able to increase their inventory. This loan will be used to purchase the basic goods customers purchase day to day, including rice, beans, oil, soap, cheese, cream, chicken, cleaning products, and the sale of firewood, in order to generate more sales and increase their savings, so they can improve their home.

There are many persons in the city of Tarija who are involved in similar activities so their businesses are progressing slowly.

Two years ago she went to Costa Rica to work in the banana plantations, selling off her merchandise.

His business has been wood, which he buys and sells.  He is a cabinetmaker by profession.  He is married and has a 14 year old son.  For lack of money, he has not been able to buy all of the tools to do his work.  Sometimes he has to borrow from another colleague to do quality woodwork.  His house is small, and he wants to add on to it.  That would improve the food and give his family privacy.\r\n\r\nHe previously worked for a business making furniture.  But, he was able to set up his own business and make attractive furniture of all styles.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan.  He will use it to buy wood, glue, varnish, and paint to give color and other things his furniture needs.  He is happy to invest in his business.  Everything is expensive.

Most of the members are involved in the making and selling of bread, the sale of dairy products, masonry services, fast food sales, grocery sales in neighborhood stores, and meal preparation.

She has two grown children and has worked as a cook for the Nicaraguan Army since she was 8 years old. Because of her low income she has not been able to receive a loan for more than 10,000 C\u00f3rdobas. She has used her previous loans to improve her home little by little. With her last loan she plastered her walls and tiled her living room. With this loan she will finish plastering the outdoor walls because it required more cement and sand and she was unable to complete the job with her last loan. She is satisfied because soon her house will be more solid and look better. Many thanks to the loans that Afodenic has provided. This is her ninth loan with the institution, and she was benefitted from the improvements made on her house. Despite the financial difficulties in the country, this has allowed her and many Nicaraguan families to have a worthy house for their families.

She is a single mother of her 13 year old daughter, who studies in a school in the neighborhood. Carmen O. has been selling clothes for the past six years. In the beginning it was difficult because she began with few clothes to sell and sold them by walking through the streets. She was tired of walking and hadn't sold much; it was very frustrating. But little by little she began to have clients, who she extends credit to until payday (for two weeks). Now she has many orders from women in the free trade zone and those who she gives credit to. She is also affiliated with Avon, where she buys from the catalog to her clients' tastes. They also give a loan that she has already profited from. When she collects the money, she is going to pay it back. With this financing she is going to buy clothes, shoes, and cosmetics to offer her clients and continue in her business. With these profits she wants to plaster the walls of her house so it looks nicer and she can give her daughter greater comfort. She is accomplishing this with the helping hand of Afodenic. She is pleased to be given this opportunity with her loans. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Fanning, Kiva

L. is a 37-year-old woman living in the town of Leualesi Leauvaa.

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale.  Luafulufa has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 450 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Luafulufa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Luafulufa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  Luafulufa is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  This will be the 6th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Luafulufa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of her family.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She helps them pay their electricity, water and grocery bills, which leaves her with little left over for university. Janina wants very much to finish her studies and improve her future, so she started working in a market frequented by Nicaraguans, where products are cheap and plentiful. Thankfully she found a new job with better pay, and she has been working there for two years. Now that she has a better income, Janina wants to build her own room so that she can have more privacy. She needs credit for building materials like stone, sand, cement, iron and zinc. This loan will allow her to begin her project and finish it gradually. Janina says she is studying English because language opens doors that will allow her to improve her station in life, earn a better living, and help her parents so that they'll want for nothing. <br

Her husband is a workman for the \u201cZona Franca\u201d (a governmental organization that regulates exportation from Nicaragua).  His salary is low, but he has a great desire to save to build his own house.  She has worked as a teacher at a neighborhood school for two years.  She studied as an engineer in computer systems.  Thanks to her father (her mother abandoned them when she was little), who sacrificed much, she finished high school.  She had to work as a domestic employee to be able to pay for her education, and she went to school on Saturdays.  Then she worked for the Zona Franca to be able to pay the university because her father had few economic resources.  It is difficult, but she did it.  You have to have a lot of will power and the desire to succeed.  Her goal is to be able to find a better job where she will be able to practice her profession.  That way she would earn more and be able to start building her house.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy rocks, sand, and metal to go forward and start.  Everything is expensive, and it is difficult to build all at once.

of a group of capable and strong-willed women who make supporting their families a high priority. Despite the obstacles that surface on a daily basis, they have been able to form an excellent working team that looks out for the welfare of its members. The Communal Bank is located in the city of Cuenca, which lies in a mountainous region of southern Ecuador.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Blanca I. is a member of the Responsible Ladies Communal Bank.  She lives in the neighborhood of Visorey in central Cuenca.  She is 63 years old, married, and the mother of 6 children ranging in age from 28 to 44.  All of her children are grown and live independently.  Blanca and her husband are raising a grandson who was abandoned at birth.  Her husband is 67 years old and has been working at his carpentry workshop for 20 years.  This business has provided for their daily needs and enabled them to build a house, although it is still unfinished.\r\n<p>\r\nBlanca assists her husband in his workshop and also performs the household chores.  Since she suffers from high blood pressure and kidney disease, she is not able to overextend herself and lead a normal life.  She is also concerned about her business because orders have declined significantly because customers are finding alternatives to wood that are less expensive.\r\n<p>\r\nFor six years, Blanca has been working with her Communal Bank.  She invested her loans into her business and her home.  With this new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she will buy wood for making beds, cupboards, and other pieces so that she will have inventory for her business. \r\n<p>\r\nBlanca\u2019s biggest dream is to continue and grow her business since this is her family\u2019s livelihood. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

This will be a great help to his parents because they are such a close family.  In the future, Lester plans to finish his education so that he can find a new job.  He thanks the Institution for providing financing to many families so that they can improve their businesses and their housing situations.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan

The residents engage in agriculture, primarily the cultivation of corn and vegetables.  The area is well-known for its colorful festivals, traditional music, local customs (such as climbing the grease pole), fireworks, and numerous attractions that bring in domestic and foreign tourists.  The Communal Bank consists of members who are related to one another.  They are looking for new ways to be productive and generate income so that their families can have a better quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Flor F. D. is a member of the Vegaspamba Communal Bank.  She lives in the San Joaquin Parrish located on the outskirts of Cuenca.  She is 32 years old and has been separated from her husband for four years as a result of misunderstandings and a lack of communication.  Flor is the mother of seven children ranging in age from 3 to 17.  Her oldest daughter works as a housekeeper in order to help with the household expenses.  The other children are students in either elementary or secondary school.  Only her nine year old son lives with his grandmother in the community of Vegaspamba.  Flor\u2019s house is made only of boards and sheets of zinc.\r\n<p>\r\nFlor is engaged in agriculture, planting all types of vegetables so that she can sell them at the open fair or in the markets of Cuenca.  She has been farming for many years since she learned the trade from her parents.  Her work begins every day at 4am.  On Wednesdays and Saturdays, she travels to the fair.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth cycle working with the Institution.  She used her previous loans to purchase seeds for planting crops.  Flor also received training on how to save money.  With this new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she will purchase seeds for growing lettuce, tomatoes, spinach, carrots, broccoli, and other vegetables.  Part of the money will be used to buy school supplies for her children.\r\n<p>\r\nHer goal is to increase her crop output and improve her financial situation so that her children can have a better future.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Rosa D. is also a member of the Vegaspamba Communal Bank and lives in the community of the same name.  She is 57 years old and has been separated for 18 years when her husband abandoned the family.  Rosa has six children, all of whom are married.  Her home is a result of all the hard work she has performed since she was a young woman.  Rosa currently lives with her grandson, who attends school in Vegaspamba.  He is the only person who provides her company.\r\n<p>\r\nRosa produces handmade sweaters.  She took up weaving six years ago when friends from the neighborhood taught her this skill.  Rosa now instructs other women how to start this type of business in their own communities.  The women she teaches produce mainly nylon bags.\r\n<p>\r\nRosa is participating in her fourth cycle with the Foundation.  She says that her previous loans were a great help because they enabled her to maintain her business.  With this new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she will purchase bags for her business and some food for household consumption.\r\n<p>\r\nRosa hopes to remain financially stable.\r\n<br

Also, since 2006 he began to take out loans on an individual basis and he completed 4 loan cycles; today he returns after an interval of two years.  For 2 years Se\u00f1or Grover worked as a hairdresser but since that business was not doing well he decided on a change of pace and started a new job on the recommendation of a friend, in a company that does gardening, landscaping and other outdoor maintenance. After 2 years working with this firm Se\u00f1or Grover saw a great opportunity in this line of work, and that with some sacrifice and creativity this could end up being a good source of income for his family. It's now been 7 months that Grover has been working independently, and today he has 4 regular customers.  He has a contract with a hotel, and in this month of November he started to work for another five star hotel, based on the recommendation of one of his former bosses.  For this reason he has come to request a loan to invest in tools and machinery that will help to speed up his services so that he can serve more customers.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa

The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Faalagilagi has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Faalagilagi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Faalagilagi has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  Faalagilagi is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.  This will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.

S. is from the village of  Kiburiao,  in Quezon Bukidnon. She is 41 years old. Celita is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Celita owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Celita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Celita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Celita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Celita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Celita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":424386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He has been engaged in his business for over twenty years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Procopio joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. He is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase land on which to raise additional crops. This loan will be his first from PMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve fund for future emergencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P. is from the village of Kiburiao, Quezon Bukidnon. He is 43 years old and married with three school-aged children. To make a living, Hilario owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Hilario has been engaged in his business for over ten years and earns approximately $338 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Hilario joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. Hilario has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Hilario is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be his 16th loan from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. lives in the village of Nabantu-an 1, Brgy Balintawak, Escalante City Negros Occidental. She is 48 years old, and married to Roberto M. who works as a laborer in the Ceres bus terminal. They have 3 children who are between 5 and 19 years old. Tessie has accepted the reality that her husband\u2019s income is just too small to sustain their family's growing needs. This is why she explored ways to help her husband by earning on her own, because she also dreamed that her children would be able to finish their college education, have gainful work and live a more comfortable life.<p>\r\n\r\nIt was quite providential that a friend invited her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon, and with her husband's consent, she became a member in 1997 and she used her loans to start a general store. The business turned out to be a good investment for it had an immediate impact by lightening the burden of the household expenses from her husband's shoulders. When a new opportunity arose to buy and sell scrap materials (old metals, plastic, bottles, etc.), she jumped at the chance and it improved her business income even further. Now her business earns an average net income of PHP 2,400 per month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, she borrowed the amount of PHP 12,000, which she used as additional working capital for her general store and scrap business. The loan was fully paid on time, maintaining her standing as a good member. Now she is borrowing for her 12th cycle loan the same amount of PHP 12,000 to be used as additional capital for her businesses. She plans to use the income from this venture for house repairs and as a start-up capital for a new business which she is presently exploring.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":423526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Alfiya is 46 years old. She is married with two children. She owns a specialized fabrics store in the central market in Dushanbe City. Because the national dresses in Tajikistan are very popular and very important item of the dowry of any girl, demand is consistently high. She is one of the leading fabrics vendors in the market in which she works. \r\n\r\nAlfiya is very persistent and determined in all of her business endeavors, which have helped support her and her family for 5 years. Moreover, Alfiya is a skilled entrepreneur. When she started this trade, she decided to implement basic concepts of integrity and hard work in her business to reach ultimate success. This laid a firm foundation for winning results and Alfiya has obviously been a successful small entrepreneur. However, she doesn\u2019t want to stop. She would like to continue seeing her venture grow. Consequently, she is currently requesting a loan of $1,100 USD, which she will use to increase her assorted inventory and possibly open a new vending location in the future. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which began soon after it became independent from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients are able to borrow money. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which began soon after it became independent from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients are able to borrow money.
