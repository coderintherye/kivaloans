She lives in her own home with her two sons:  Nico, who is 16, and Manuel, who is 15.  She wants to give them a good education.  Her business is making clothing for children.  Since she was very young, she has done this work.  She now has her own shop to make children's clothing, which she later takes to sell at her stand where they are purchased quickly.  What she likes most about her job is making clothing for the smallest children because she feels a lot of tenderness.  She has done this work for 5 years and thinks the most difficult part is finishing the clothing because she has to do this with a lot of care.

She lives in her parents\u2019 house and what she wants most is to improve her quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough she is still young, she knows that she needs to contribute to the household expenses.  This is why she decided to enter the business of selling clay handicrafts, which she purchases from the city of Pucara (district in the Puno region) to then brings them to sell in the city of Arequipa, where she has her sales stand.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat she likes most about her job is participating in the different markets that take place in the city of Arequipa.  She has been involved in this business for 2 years and thinks that the most difficult part is transporting the handicrafts, since they have very delicate structures and they run the risk of breaking.  With time, she hopes to have a big handicraft store where she can sell more comfortably.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Victoria\u2019s fourth loan with MFP.  She knows that she needs to make her loan repayments on time and she is prepared to do so.  She is a very well-liked member of her communal bank.

She lives in one of her family member's homes with her two daughters:  Katia, who is 7, and Maria, who is 5.  They are the motive for all of her efforts.  She has a business selling beer.  Her stand is located in the mining center called, \"La Rinconada.\"  Every weekend, she moves many boxes of beer to renew what has been consumed during the week.  She is a very happy and charismatic saleswoman.  This is why her customers prefer her over her competition.  What she likes the most about her job is talking with her customers since this makes her long work days more enjoyable.  She has done this work for 2 years and she thinks the most difficult part about it is transporting the boxes of beer from the city of Juliaca to the mine.  It is a long and tiring trip.  In the future, she hopes to have a store where she can offer her customers better service.  This is her first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She knows that she has to make her payments on time and is willing to do this.  She is a very happy and collaborative member of her communal bank.  With the 1,000 PEN that she is requesting, she will buy more boxes of beer since her demand has increased.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":436123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","use":"To increase her amount of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-27T03:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":168.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843244,"comment":null},{"amount":116.9,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:50Z","rounded_local_amount":336.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734858,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":168.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959923,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":168.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992767,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:59Z","rounded_local_amount":166.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717552,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-28T19:18:22Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":157398,"name":"Concha Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nMar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 C.

P. is a 42-year-old woman living in the town of Sataua Uta.  She is married and has 4 school-aged children.  To make a living,  Ruta owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting taro for sale.   Ruta has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008,  Ruta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.   Ruta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to rent land to raise additional crops.   Ruta is now requesting a new loan of 1450 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.   Ruta plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to financially support immediate members of her family.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

M.. is a 49-year-old woman living in the town of Sataua Tai.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Faaofo has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 370 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faaofo joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Faaofo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Faaofo is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Faaofo plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting 'taamu' for sale.  Lomaga has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 300 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lomaga joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lomaga has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Lomaga is now requesting a new loan of 1400 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Lomaga plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

G. is 55 years old and lives with his wife and two youngest children in Uvs province, one of Mongolia's western provinces. His two oldest sons are 19 and 22 years old and are both university students in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His two youngest daughters go to local secondary schools in Uvs province.\r\n\r\nMyagmar retails bags of coals to locals, especially during the cold season when families purchase a lot coal to keep their homes warm. He mostly purchases coal from local mines and resells it to local small businesses and families.

He has been a reliable and good supplier of coal for their families and their small businesses.\r\n\r\nAlthough he is already 55 years old, Myagmar is still capable of carrying bags of coal and is happy with his business. He requests a loan to purchase more coal for reselling. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank:\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

Fou is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.

G. is a 51-year-old married woman who lives in the village of Shopping, Brgy. Fabrica, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She is engaged in food vending as a source of daily income and raises pigs on the side as a supplement. Her husband Welfredo works as a carpenter. They are blessed with two children who are 15 and 20 years old and still going to school. The younger is in high school and the older attends college. It is Piladel's dream for her children to finish their studies and have a stable income from gainful employment or a stable livelihood, so that they will have a more comfortable life ahead of them.\r\n\r\nShe thought of going into business to augment her husband's income because she knew that her husband's work could be seasonal at times. And if they relied on only one source of income, she would not be able to fulfill her dreams for her children and their family. At first, she only raised pigs in her backyard, but the return on her investment took 3-4 months to pay off, so she decided to engage in food vending so that she would have a daily income. As her business continued to flourish, she soon needed additional capital to sustain her business operations.\r\n\r\nThis is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002. Her loans contributed a lot to increasing their income capacity by allowing them to raise more pigs and increase the variety of food that she sold. Now her minimum monthly income has increased to PHP 2,000 from her food vending operations. And her income from selling the pigs helps to pay for her children's education and provides additional income for their business.\r\n\r\nPiladel's previous loan of PHP 19,500 was used as additional working capital for her business. It was fully paid within her loan term without delay. Now she is borrowing her 15th loan in the same amount, PHP 19,500 to be used as additional capital for her pig fattening and food vending businesses. Some of the income will be set aside for her children\u2019s education and to pay for their family expenses. The rest will be plowed back as capital for their business operations.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":434572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Additional

is Marcelino T., a 45-year-old freelance videographer who lives in a fairly large village in San Mateo, Rizal. His wife, Flordeliza, 46, is a freelance writer\/editor. They have five adult children of whom three are enrolled in college while the other two are in high school.\r\n\r\nMarcelino got on-the-job training in videography and video editing from a local broadcast media outfit a few years ago. He has also worked as a writer\/editor for different local publications for twelve years. He used these acquired talents in business when he ventured into freelance videography in 2003. This was the start of his career in media services. He began to provide photo\/video coverage for his clients until this day.\r\n\r\nMarcelino has a small studio where he develops photos. He also produces and edits raw video footage which he himself has covered. His net income is now close to P35,000.\r\n\r\nMarcelino joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in the summer of 2008. The loans provided by the cooperative helped him improve his business for the satisfaction of his clients.\r\n\r\nBecause Marcelino respects the wishes of his clients, he wishes to upgrade his computer so he is able to use more state-of-the-art computer applications to enhance the quality of pictures and videos produced at his studio. To get this done, he applied for a new loan with CCT in the amount of P20,000 for the necessary upgrade of his studio computer. This will be his 6th loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About CCT<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":430238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","use":"To

She is 62 years old and wife to Nestor who is 55 years old and is a fisherman. She is blessed with one child, the apple of her eye, named Nestle Ann A., 22 years old, a college student.\r\n\r\nAquilina's dream is to uplift their living conditions. She wants to give a decent life to her family, especially her only daughter. She is engaged in a fishing business and has a fish cage where she raises small fish until they grow and are ready for harvest. The business seems to be profitable and sound and she wants to invest more in it.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Aquilina joined Ahon sa Hirap, Inc., a micro-finance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with the aspiration of having access to capital. She is requesting a loan of Php 25,000 as additional capital for her fish cage. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for thousands of fingerlings (small fish), one hundred pieces bamboo, sacks of fish food, three rolls of rope, and gasoline for their boat. She will also become engaged in selling RTW (Ready-To-Wear clothes) - assorted clothes for all ages.\r\n\r\nAquilina is optimistic that her business will grow and that she can earn more income to save in preparation for her only child\u2019s future, especially her education fees. She also aspires to having more fish cages in order to generate more fish since that means a greater income. She wants also to renovate her fish cage because it was broken in the huge <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Typhoon_Ondoy\">Typhoon Ondoy<\/a> which was followed by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Typhoon_Mirinae_%282009%29\u201d>Typhoon Santi<\/a>  so that a lot of fishing businesses were

A. is a native of the island village of Talim Binangonan, in the Rizal province of the Philippines. She is a courageous mother who hopes to rise from poverty. She is 62 years old and married to Leon, who is 62 years old and a fisherman. She has 5 children, between the ages of 27 and 43, none of whom finished their studies in college due to poverty. The income from the business has been insufficient to provide for further education for her children beyond high school. \r\n\r\nLuisa's biggest dream is to raise the family's standard of living. She wants to give her family a refined life. She has been in the fishing business for almost 44 years. The sales seem to be profitable and sound, and she desires to invest more in the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, she joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with the encouragement of having access to more capital for a larger income. She is requesting a loan of Php 20,000.00 as additional capital for her fishing business. \r\n\r\nLuisa is hopeful that her business will grow and that she can earn more income.  She would like to save money to help fulfill their dreams to support her children to have a good life and to send her grandchildren to school to finish college, something she failed to provide for her children. Her children are a big support to Luisa and she also believes that her grandchildren are the hopes of their future dreams.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":436267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"purchase of

L. is from the village of Bayabo East. She is 37 years-old and married with three school-aged children.  Marvie owns and operates a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing rice processing to local community members. In 2009, Marvie joined Kiva partner ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marvie is requesting a first loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

D. graduated from school in 2006 and got just married recently. She is now 32 years old and lives with her husband and 1-year-old daughter in Bayanhongor province, one of Mongolia's central provinces. Her husband currently stays home and takes care of the baby.\r\n\r\nSelenge used to mine for gold by hand like many locals do at the gold-mining site. She gave up the dirty mining and decided to sell clothes at the local market. Since July 2008, she has been renting a small stall at the local black market and retailing women\u2019s and men\u2019s clothes. She purchases inventory clothes from China, where many of cheap products flood into the country and resells them at her stall. She hopes to expand her business and rent one more stall to sell more clothes.\r\n\r\nSelenge requests a loan to purchase more inventory for her retail business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About XacBank:<\/b>\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

From this business, Francis generates approximately 30,000 KES per month. <p>\r\n\r\nFrancis explains that he started his business two years ago with a loan from Equity Bank.  He was able to obtain this loan because he was a salaried employee working in accounting.  When he left his accounting job, he opted for a loan from KADET to help him improve his business.  With this loan that he is seeking, Francis will purchase new jeans and shirts to sell in his clothing shops.  He only buys one of each style so that he can keep his merchandise unique, which he thinks draws customers to his stores.  In the future, Francis hopes to open a large retail shop and to import specialty men's clothing. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout KADET: \r\nThe Kenya Agency for the Development of Enterprise and Technology (KADET) is dedicated to economically empowering its clients.

He and his family live in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian housing tent.  His oldest son, Lhamsuren, is a college student, and his youngest, Banzragch, is in high school.  <p>\r\n\r\nBayarhuu operates a wood product-making business in his town as a partnership with a few of his friends.  He mainly produces wood items which are used in ger construction and traditional ger furniture.  His business is very popular and his customer base includes both residents of his province as well as two other adjoining provinces.  Bayarhuu started his business in 1999, and he has made much progress over the years.  He is a savvy businessman, and he is constantly looking for ways to improve his operations.  For example, because many countryside people, who are his main customers, often lack sufficient cash to purchase his products, he instead trades with them; more specifically, he might trade his wood items for flour, which he would then sell in his town for a profit.  Bayarhuu has used his business' success to build a workshop and to provide a quality life for his family.  He says, \"I want my children to be educated people and to have a good life.  I am working hard to support them.\"  He has many plans for the future, such as expanding his workshop and hiring two new assistants.  By doing so, he will be able to expand his production capacity and to begin producing a wider variety of unique and stylish furniture.  Bayarhuu is requesting a loan in the amount of 700,000 tugrug (approximately $500 USD) to purchase wood and materials for his business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank: XacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

She lives with her husband and her four children whose ages range between 12 and 27.  The three youngest go to school.  She isn't responsible financially for anyone else and saves 1,500 meticais a month.<p>\r\nLina left Gaza for the town of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland with her oldest brother, who was working for the registry office in that district.  When she arrived to Namaacha, she enrolled in school.  In that same year, she became pregnant and had to stop studying because at that time it wasn't allowed to go to school while pregnant.  She got married, and five days later, her husband abandoned her and left for South Africa.  He left a letter that she only discovered 6 months later claiming that he was going to look for a job.  Her life was difficult, so she asked her brother for help, and he got her a job at the registry office where she worked for 5 years.  After she finished her contract, she married her current husband who now lives with her in her home.  With the money she made from her job, she started her own business selling capulanas (robes\/dresses) which she acquired in Maputo and resold in Swaziland.  Her business has grown and she can't satisfy her customers' demand anymore.  She is turning to Hluvuku and Kiva for her fourth loan so she can increase her stock of merchandise.  Today she has better products (sheets, blankets, duvets, pants, and curtains).  She buys these items for 400, 500, and 350 meticais and resells them for 1,000, 1250, and 600 meticais.  She makes a monthly profit of 8,000 meticais.<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva.  Her first one was for 11,000 meticais to buy various types of clothing like blouses, sheets, duvets, blankets, pants, and curtains).  Her second one was for 15,500 meticais to increase her volume of merchandise.  Her third was for 20,000 meticais to expand her kitchen, which is now complete.  This one is for 25,000 meticais, which she will use to increase the volume of her business.  She is building a boutique because at her age she doesn't want to make deliveries to people's homes anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

His first produce was strawberry but because he didn't have any irrigation system (drop by drop) which enables diversification of produce, he contacted Hluvuku requesting a loan for 25.000MT to increase the volume of production.\r\n\r\nYears later this is his 3rd loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva, his first of 25.000MT was used to buy an irrigation system drop by drop for seeds of

She has extensive experience in the business of renting moto-taxis (motorcycles with an attached cab for passengers). Ana's husband is currently abroad, and he sends remittances to pay the expenses of maintaining and educating his children. Thanks to the savings from these funds, Ana was able to buy a moto-taxi, and she now has 3 vehicles. She is not able to live in her own house, since it was destroyed by an earthquake, and that is why she is currently living in her parents' home. Ana dedicates all of her available income, both from the remittances and the rental of her moto-taxis, to her children's education; her daughters are university students, and her youngest son is in primary school. Ana dreams of seeing her daughters and her youngest son graduate, and she also dreams of being able to rebuild her house and thus provide security and well-being to her children. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":436424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Repairing her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2009-11-27T15:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":119.08},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":145.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":155.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":154.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160.8},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":164.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":170.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":174.73},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":180.15},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":186.32},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":191.52},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":197.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.26},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.1},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.51},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.7},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.16},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.05},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.21},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.03},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.68,"local_amount":119.08,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:05:54Z","rounded_local_amount":120.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118054310,"comment":null},{"amount":105.1,"local_amount":300.29,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":302.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123889221,"comment":null},{"amount":54.1,"local_amount":154.56,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-20T07:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":155.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137225634,"comment":null},{"amount":56.28,"local_amount":160.8,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-19T08:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":162.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145159805,"comment":null},{"amount":57.51,"local_amount":164.34,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-04T07:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":165.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":155654922,"comment":null},{"amount":59.7,"local_amount":170.56,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-20T07:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":171.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160170206,"comment":null},{"amount":61.16,"local_amount":174.73,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:14Z","rounded_local_amount":176.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166820659,"comment":null},{"amount":63.05,"local_amount":180.15,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":181.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172088089,"comment":null},{"amount":65.21,"local_amount":186.32,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:19:06Z","rounded_local_amount":187.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177379440,"comment":null},{"amount":136.21,"local_amount":389.17,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":392.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182517313,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T03:31:46Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:31:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":157536,"name":"Perlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perlita C., from the village of Divisoria, is 48 years old, widowed, and has six adult-aged children.

succeed.  Lourdes Ga\u00f1an was a member of this group but left four years ago because she had intentions to travel abroad.  However, her plans were canceled and she used her loans to pay off debts that she acquired.  Three years ago, she returned to the Communal Bank and has been active member for the past two years.  Lourdes lives in the neighborhood of Los Laureles in the Santa Ana Parrish.  She is 25 years old, married, and the mother of two children (ages 7 and 1).  Her oldest child attends the Alfonso Mar\u00eda Borrero School in the community.  Her husband works as a bricklayer and together they built their own home.  \r\n<p>\r\nFour months ago, Lourdes started working Monday through Friday at a school snack bar in Santa B\u00e1rbara.  She established her restaurant two months ago and is open Friday evenings and all day Saturday and Sunday.   It is located in a rented facility in the Bella Uni\u00f3n district.  Lourdes also raises chickens and pigs.

Her husband works as a cattle dealer.  \r\n<p>\r\nAurelia prepares and sells food.  She butchers her own pigs for making savory dishes such as roasted pork, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sancocho\" target=\"_blank\" >sancocho<\/a>, blood sausage, etc.  Aurelia has been in this business for 20 years and says that there are both good days and bad, but she always manages to earn a little bit of profit.  She also operates a small grocery store inside her home.  \r\n<p>\r\nAurelia has been working with the Foundation for 10 years and used her loans to invest in her businesses.  This new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR will be used to purchase pigs for fattening and slaughter.  The meat will be used in the preparation of her dishes.  Her goal is to help her children establish themselves financially so that they lack nothing.    \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Martha estimates that the purchase of clothes for the end of the year festivities will increase, and she needs a loan to buy the raw material like wool.  She buys her supplies at the 16 de Julio (a fair), and also sells her products at the 16 de Julio.  Her customers are women who have fixed sales places.  That means that she sells wholesale, and the other people sell by the unit.  Martha has five children that she takes care of and protects.\r\n\r\nAnother example is Evelyn L., who is only 19.  She goes to school and she makes clothes like skirts.  With her mother\u2019s help, she sells them in Desaguadero, Los Yungas, and Santa Cruz.  She is single, and she wants to continue studying and expanding her business.  She needs a loan to buy fabric.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group also need the loan to buy products.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Lurigancho and is maD. up of persons who have overcome problems as big as abandonment.  For example:  Hilaria, 55, has learned to overcome heavy blows in life.  She was abandoned as a very young girl and had to roam the streets begging for food until she met a woman who became fond of her and helped her with food and clothing.  Still, Hilaria had to work.  Hilaria grew based on toil and, by the age of 14, had exacting jobs.  One of them was as a dishwasher in a restaurant.  At 15, she met the man who would become her partner and father of her two daughters.  He was employed as a municipal trash collector, a job that barely earned him enough income to eat.  Years passed and when their eldest daughter was 12 years old and the youngest was 6, Hilaria suffered another abandonment; this time by her partner.  He abandoned her to her fate, with two daughters.  Hilaria now had to be both mother and father and started working again.  She began selling candy, then popsicles and ice-cream.  Later it was food, prepared meals and at night, sweets and cookies that she peddled from a basket that she carried through the streets.  After 25 years, her ex-partner and father of their daughters, returned but only because he was crippled.  Their daughters were unaffected by this turn of events because they were independent by this time with families of their own.  Now, Hilaria's partner helps out with what he can, like tending to the business, etc.  Currently, Hilaria has a small kiosk which the city allows her to use to sell sweets, candies, beverages, etc. and she also has a small ice-cream vending cart for Donofrio brand items and she has traveling phone booths.  She is a strong woman who has dreams like so many other women in this society.

The easiest way to reach it is via the Cuautla-Izucar de Matamoros highway.  Arriving at the 4 Caminos intersection, there is a detour to the right which is the Cuautla-Axochiapan highway.  14 Kilometers from there is Tepalcingo.  The La Estrella Flat communal bank is located in this town.  It is in its first loan cycle since two of its members used to be part of a different group but, due to some delays, the group fell apart.  As of today, they are on their fourth repayment and they have been noted for the punctuality in their repayments.  The most common activity in Tepalcingo is commerce, then agriculture, and in third place, cattle raising.  One of the members of this group is Maricela T. N., 49, who is in a common law relationship.  She had 4 children but one died at birth so she only has three.  She has been a member of Fundacion Realidad for about 2 years.  Prior to this she was working with a group called Akasia but many of its members fell behind in their payments; they paid, but we had to be chasing after them  to do so.  As a result, the punctual members lost their benefits and the group fell apart.  Maricela was offered a different method: to form a new group of 5 members.  She was very interested and found other people who had businesses.  Maricela sells chicken, eggs, clarasol (a laundry product), etc.  Maria de los Angeles M. sells soft-drinks, Adriana Betzabel sells bedspreads, Maria C. L. sells costume jewelry, Jeny sells clothes.  Maricela\u2019s loan was for $6000 which she will use to buy bread, chicken, eggs, soft-drinks, clarasol, etc.  She sells from her home which is located on Aquiles Serdan steet at the corner of Tezozomo, in Buenos Aires neighborood.  She tells us that almost all of Tepalcingo is made up of poor neighborhoods but Buenos Aires is a nicer area.  Her greatest dream is to have her own store like she had almost 5 years ago but, due to problems, had to let it go; she sold off all her diplay cases, shelving, etc. and now she uses little tables at her home to display her wares.  She would like to recover her store the way it used to be so that she can help her husband and her children to get ahead and be someone in life.  She tells us that she does well in her store since there are no others nearby.  Besides, the good customer service she provides brings more than 100 persons daily to her store and this is how she makes her profits which she reinvests every third day in soft-drinks and daily in chicken.  Lastly, she is grateful for the confidence placed in her despite what had happened with the previous group and she hopes to continue forward for a time to see her dreams come true and have her store.  She states:  \u201cI will not let you down.\u201d  She thanks Kiva for trusting Fundacion Realidad because they do what they say they will and she\u2019s sure they won\u2019t let Kiva down.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":435149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":" To buy soft-drinks, chicken, egs, oil, clarasol (a laundry product), etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TEPALCINGO MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana Betzabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":22000,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":956.25,"local_amount":12375,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":12479.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110686020,"comment":null},{"amount":425,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5546.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080352,"comment":null},{"amount":318.75,"local_amount":4125,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4159.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123916674,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-02T19:17:20Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:15:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":157600,"name":"Blanca Adriana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Blanca M. desde muy temprano inicia su venta de alimentos preparados por ella misma y comercializados en el mercado Central de Chinandega donde varias personas le compran por prepararlos con altas normas de higiene y por su puesto con muy buen sabor.\nElla se dedica a esta actividad desde hace cuatro a\u00f1os y hoy en d\u00eda est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de la materia prima para elaborar los alimentos y as\u00ed continuar ofreci\u00e9ndolos en su localidad en su localidad y as\u00ed generar ingresos para suplir las necesidades de su hogar.\n","en":"Mrs. Blanca M. begins selling meals she prepares early in the day in the central market of Chinandega.

Montoya, Melania L. & Martha H. are the members of the 3M group.  They are forward-looking, hard-working, very capable women.  Mrs. L. has made nacatamales for the past 20 years. [A nacatamal consists of dough (masa) (made from nixtamalized corn flour, milk and lard mixed with ground potatoes, green peppers, onions, garlic, salt and spice) and a filling (relleno) consisting of pork or chicken, tomatoes, rice, garlic, onions, potatoes, and mint leaves. The filling may also include olives, raisins or fresh chile. It is wrapped in plantain leaves to give it a unique flavor, tied, and then steamed or pressure cooked for several hours].  This typical Nicaraguan dish is usually served, accompanied by tortillas or bread and coffee, for Saturday dinner or Sunday breakfast.  F. Montoya began selling Avon products door-to-door last year and Martha H. sells tortillas, beans and cuajada (Cuajada is a soft type of cheese that is maybe similar to feta but much saltier and great to eat with gallo pinto or just beans alone).<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Her wish to have a business of her own led her to determine that this type of business would be very profitable because the site where she has her store is located near a school and that guarantees her daily sales because students are her most regular customers.  Yovana tends to her sales all day, every day of the week because only thus can she earn enough to cover not only her household expenses but also the rental of her store.  Her future desire is to have a large commercial esablishment where she can sell a wide variety of food items.  This is her third loan with MFP.  She is considered to be most punctual with repayments and with meeting assistance by her fellow group members.  The funds requested will be used to buy stock items like jars of evaporated milk, sweets, and soft-drinks.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":436710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy stock inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":309}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":315.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734870,"comment":null},{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":315.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124194,"comment":null},{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":315.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959935,"comment":null},{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":315.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992779,"comment":null},{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:04Z","rounded_local_amount":315.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717569,"comment":null},{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":315.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751245,"comment":null},{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":315.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933795,"comment":null},{"amount":108.15,"local_amount":309,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:24Z","rounded_local_amount":311.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672697,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T20:06:01Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":157667,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Grace M.

Her greatest desire is to improve their quality of life.  She sells papayas in the Las Mercedes (Juliaca's most important market) market.  Her husband brings the papayas from the city of Puerto Maldonado (a city on the Brazilian border).  Her stand is very popular because her papayas are fresh and juicy and this has attracted many customers.  What Luz most likes about her job is being able to chat with her fellow merchants because that makes the long work days much more pleasant.  She has been in this line of work for 8 years and considers the most difficult part of it having to stay at her post all day long not being able to go out anywhere.

Sometimes she also sells them sweets.  The children always welcome her products but her low income precludes her from stocking all the items the students ask for.  This is why she is seeking financing for the first time from Edpyme Alternativa in the form of a 1000 new sol loan to buy stock items to expand her business.  Mar\u00eda hopes to continue working so that she can finish building her house.

She lives with her family in the Ucupe sector, Lagunas district, located 35 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.  She has sold ducks for the last year.  She buys ducklings, raises them, then sells them to her customers.  This is an important source of income for her family since her husband works as a temporary agricultural laborer.  A short while ago she bought a few ducklings and she has begun to feed them so that their sale will be successful.  Viviana is very dedicated to her work but the small income earned is not enough for her to reach her goals, one of which is to finish roofing her house.  This is an urgent need because the usual rainy Summer season is fast approaching.  This is why she has called upon Edpyme Alternativa for the first time requesting a 500 new sol loan.  Her greatest wish is to offer her children a good education and to see her business grow.

There, she offers various fruits and beverages to the drivers who frequent the area.  She tells us that this work is an important help to the family's economy and it keeps her busy during the day.  Her business has become well-known and she always has customers who request her merchandise. Zulema wants to buy more fruit to enlarge her business but lacks the necessary capital to do so.  This is why she is asking Edpyme Alternativa for her first, 1000 new sol, loan.  Her greatest wish is to set up a grocery store to continue to provide for her son and for the child that she is expecting.  Zulema is a cheerful, very responsible and hard-working woman.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":436764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Nuevo Mocupe - Lagunas - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:01:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zulema Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":69.87},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":69.1},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75.29},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.49},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":81.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84.47},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":89.61},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":92.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.47},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":98.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.19},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.47},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.57},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.41},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.41},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":24.45,"local_amount":69.87,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:24Z","rounded_local_amount":70.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669676,"comment":null},{"amount":24.19,"local_amount":69.1,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":69.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065177,"comment":null},{"amount":26.35,"local_amount":75.29,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:14Z","rounded_local_amount":75.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900278,"comment":null},{"amount":27.47,"local_amount":78.49,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":79.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934432,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":78.55,"processed_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":79.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662048,"comment":null},{"amount":28.4,"local_amount":81.17,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":81.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694755,"comment":null},{"amount":29.57,"local_amount":84.47,"processed_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":85.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877811,"comment":null},{"amount":30.52,"local_amount":87.2,"processed_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":87.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617858,"comment":null},{"amount":31.36,"local_amount":89.61,"processed_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":90.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832267,"comment":null},{"amount":100.19,"local_amount":286.25,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":288.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098891,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-16T09:04:30Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":157687,"name":"Anilistte","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anilistte E. is from the village of Pob 4, Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

Mutyaba \u2018S Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence is a 42-year-old married woman with four children between 10 and 20 years of age.  All her children go to school. She rents a two-room house where she is staying with four people. Florence takes care of additional family members. The family has access to electricity but no piped water and gets three meals a day. She incurs transport costs to and from buying second hand clothes from Owino market, one of the busiest markets in Uganda. She pays rent for both her business and residence.  She works in a semi-urban area, which is on the outskirts of Kampala. She works six days a week. She receives an average of 10 customers a day and sells to all categories of people, at both retail and wholesale. Besides this second hand clothes business, she does tailoring for both new and torn clothes.  Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family and school fees for her children. Her major business challenges are transportation and the rainy season because she works in an open place. She has been in this business for eight years and with MCDT for eight years servicing her 13th loan, working with the same group mates. Florence joined MCDT because it was near her home and was working with poor women. She wants to use this loan to buy more bales of second hand clothes and materials for tailoring. She is hoping to see her business grower bigger and start selling wholesale only.\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":499.56,"image":{"id":436957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

She incurs transport costs to and from buying charcoal from villages. Mary has a charcoal store in Ndeeba town and pays 30000\/= for monthly rent charges. She works seven days a week. She receives an average of 30 customers a day and sells to all categories of people, both in wholesale and retail.  Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family, medication and school fees. Her major business challenges are transportation and the rainy season, which hinders her customers from reaching out to her because she works in an area that floods. She has been in this business for ten years and with MCDT for three years, now servicing her tenth loan. She wants to use this loan to buy more sacks of charcoal. She aspires to see her business grower bigger and to start selling wholesale

The family has no access to electricity or piped water, and gets three meals a day. \r\n<p>\r\nFlorence works in a semi-urban area which is on the outskirts of Kampala. She incurs transport costs to and from buying chicken from poultry farmers. She owns a stall in Kalerwe market selling chicken of all types, including local layers and broilers. She works seven days a week. She receives an average of 30 customers a day and sells to all categories of people, both in retail and wholesale. Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family and school fees for her children. Her major business challenges are transportation and thieves. She has been in this business for fifteen years and with MCDT for nine years, now servicing her twenty-third loan and working with the same group mates. Florence joined MCDT because it was near her home amd works with poor women. She wants to use this loan to buy more chicken. She aspires to see her business grow bigger, to start selling wholesale only, and to farm poultry.

The family has access to electricity and piped water and gets three meals a day. She incurs transport costs to and from buying merchandise from Kikuubo (one of the busiest places in Kampala city). She works in a semi urban area which is in the outskirts of Kampala. Ann Mary owns a retail shop in Nsooba Kyebando and doesn\u2019t pay for rent because she owns the business premises. She works seven days a week. She receives an average of 30 customers a day and sells to all categories of people. Besides this retail shop, she also owns a poultry farm with 200 laying chicken. Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family, and school fees for her grand children. Her major business challenges are transportation and thieves.

She has regular clients and also works with bakeries and grocery stores that make monthly and daily orders.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of 3,000 nuevo soles, she will buy one ton of cassava.\r\n\r\nWith part of the money she will also buy corrugated metal and plastic sheets, main tools for drying the starch in the sun, while always paying attention to hygiene and cleanliness.\r\n\r\nCelestina and her husband make the decisions about business profits.  Personally, she feels more independent, calm, capable, and responsible toward paying their dues.\r\n\r\nCelestina thanks Manuela Ramos for allowing her to grow as a business person and a woman.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel McRoberts, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":437510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchasing one ton of cassava","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celestina Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1015,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118365,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954097,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:48Z","rounded_local_amount":507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987118,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713200,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746373,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-01T19:54:17Z","paid_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":157840,"name":"Hawa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hawa is 41 years old and married with two school-aged children.

Today she has a lot of experience with this type of activity and is very well known and liked by her customers.  \r\n<p>To this day she has a steady customer base who visit her store daily to buy her items as she has all the items necessary that a housewife could need and she personally takes care of her customers and treats them with the charm that typifies her.\r\n<p>With this loan of S\/ 2,000.00, she will buy rice and sugar in sacks, spaghetti in packs, milk and canned fish in boxes in a variety of brands, cleaning utensils for the home and personal hygiene products to continue giving better service to her customers.\r\n<p>Violeta today feels fulfilled and wants to keep getting ahead in life and to see her dreams come true.  She is grateful to the Movimiento Manuela Ramos (kiva\u2019s field partner) for helping her start her business and to many women who also want to grow in businesses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Duque, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":437566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy groceries to increase the products sold in her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Violeta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:45Z","rounded_local_amount":676.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118385,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":338.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954117,"comment":null},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":338.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987138,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":338.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713217,"comment":null},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":338.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746390,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-10T16:23:29Z","paid_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
