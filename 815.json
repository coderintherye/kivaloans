She and her husband Nelson, a taxi driver, have two children. She and her husband manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nLeonora operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from round palm-sized ones to much larger doormats, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up for every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, they are one of the most common products that you can buy, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney (a small bus) down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 3500 PHP in sales every week. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of 41,000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials such as fabric, thread, and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLeonora hopes to increase production and dreams of being able to give her everyone in her family a good life through all of her hard work on her business.

It is the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region, being the most important city of the Chilean Central Valley. In Chile there exists a curious reference to Talca, the saying, \"Talca, Paris y Londres\" (Talca, Paris and London). Among the reasoning for this saying, some think it\u2019s a derivation of something said by an Englishman, \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca looks like London; when pronounced in Spanish, \u201clooks like\u201d sounds like the word \u201cParis\u201d) because of the abundant fog that covers the Chilean city in winter time, just like the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1050311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"buy gas, 46 Kg of flour and cake molds, the latter she\u2019ll order from the city of Santiago.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nEditha oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have a one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney and are paying boundary (a daily fee) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,800 Philippine pesos (PHP) every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, Editha is requesting a 26,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new accessories and parts for their jeepney and also to buy some equipment for their repair shop. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEditha dreams of being able to buy another jeepney. She also dreams that her grandchildren will finish their education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n<u>Footnote:<\/u>\r\nCuriously, jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn. They modified the jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that make the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1052753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to pay for the spare parts and maintenance of their jeepney unit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-26T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-25T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Editha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":26000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-26T15:24:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407737,"name":"Sissegbe Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"SISSEGBE est un groupe de trois personnes, dont les membres appartiennent \u00e0 la m\u00eame association de d\u00e9corateurs.

She had 7 children who are now married, and tells us that more than 8 years ago, when her husband was still alive, she installed a small laundry in her house in order to earn a little extra money.  Now that her husband has passed away, she continues with this business and is very content that her husband left her a good business with which she has been able to get ahead.  Over time, her business has grown and gained customers.  She opens very early every day, and her customers are happy with her service since she always tends to them well and their clothes are always ready when they need them.  Feliza will invest this loan into the purchase of a variety of detergents (bleach, fabric softener, bar and powdered soap) and to maintain her machinery.  She hopes that, with this loan, she can continue to grow her business since she would also like to start a dry cleaning service.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nMirna \u2013 poultry sales\r\nRamiro \u2013 general store\r\nMargarita \u2013 sells Mexican snack foods\r\nSergio \u2013 taxi driver\r\nJuan Carlos \u2013 hamburger sales\r\nRosa \u2013 fruit and vegetable sales\r\n\r\nThis group thanks the foundation for the loan it has granted to them.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1044557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a variety of detergents (bleach, fabric softener, bar and powdered soap) and to maintain her machinery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"ACATLAN DE PEREZ, OAXACA.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-26T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-25T12:00:02Z","loan_amount":3800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramiro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sergio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Juan Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":48000,"loan_amount":3800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4800},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-27T00:19:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":405035,"name":"Cristina Rebeca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cristina es una se\u00f1orita de 26 a\u00f1os, se considera una mujer alegre, emprendedora y muy responsable.

With this support he wants to be able to increase the number of outfits he has, because sometimes he does not have enough for a musical production.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to be able to double the number of customers and so be able to build a musical group, expand his costume-rental store, and, of course, create a tourist stop where people can enjoy the different traditional folk dances of Peru.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1048980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","use":"to buy fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-03-26T14:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-25T14:30:01Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fermin Hugo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":135.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":142.28},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":145.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":152.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":156.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":161.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":169.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":173.99},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":181.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":187},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":193.85},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":201.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.7},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.43},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.24},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.98},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.69},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-27T02:53:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407462,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina is 43 years old and lives in P-6, Pan-ay, Clarin.

This way she will be able to have greater variety and gather the money necessary to start a boutique in another place, which will allow her to buy her own house."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1050452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase coffins.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-03-26T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-25T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deysi Giuliana","last_name":"Quispe Huamani","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":202.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":213.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":217.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":228.69},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":234.22},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":242.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":253.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":260.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":271.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":280.49},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":290.77},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":302.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.19},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":407480,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina is 35 years old and lives in the Philippines.

En sus 16 a\u00f1os de experiencia ha trabajado mucho, inicialmente antes de dedicarse a esta actividad comercial,  trabaj\u00f3 empleada en una familia, pero cuando crecieron sus hijos no quisieron que ella continuara en esta actividad; as\u00ed fue como con el producto de su liquidaci\u00f3n, invirti\u00f3 en prendas que vendi\u00f3 entre sus amigas y con las cuales les fue muy bien y con ellas logr\u00f3 hacer crecer su mercado y logr\u00f3 diversificar su oferta. Sus compras las hace en el centro de la ciudad cuando hay ofertas  importantes, promociones y saldos,  que le salen a un mejor precio. Por eso cuando las vende le gana dinero, sin recargar tanto a sus clientes, que le compran a cr\u00e9dito. En su negocio dos de sus hijos recuperan su cartera, contribuyendo as\u00ed con el desempe\u00f1o del negocio. Sonia tambi\u00e9n tiene otra actividad productiva, pues compra galones de arequipes de 2 a tres veces por semana y los envasa en porciones unitarias en vasos de una onza. Este \u00faltimo negocio ha tenido mucha acogida entre sus clientes, que los compran como golosinas para que sus hijos dispongan de ellas y se deleiten. La familia que Sonia conforma con sus hijos es muy unida, por eso en cada paso que da ella es respaldada; con ellos  comparte gastos y le ayudan en todo. En su venta de arequipe no necesita de activos fijos, pues no maneja inventarios. Como Sonia es una mujer tan cociente de la oportunidad tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la venta de frituras, que traslada a otro barrio donde tiene un punto de ventas,  atendido por uno de sus hijos y estos son ingresos adicionales que tambi\u00e9n recibe. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 mercanc\u00edas variadas en promoci\u00f3n. Su credikiva es una inversi\u00f3n exitosa,  porque le permite tener un dinero disponible para responder a pedidos, ya que  los plazos otorgados a sus clientes,  muchas veces no le facilitan el dar una respuesta oportuna a los nuevos compradores a cr\u00e9dito y esto con su credikiva ser\u00e1 posible.  \n\n","en":"Sonia, 52, sells clothes and underwear and also has a business selling \u201cdulce de leche\u201d or \u201carequipe\u201d [caramel].  She has six children whose ages range between 26 and 31 years; among them is a pair of twins.  All of them are her joy and she dreams that they will make progress step by step every day of their lives.\r\n\r\nIn her 16 years of experience she has worked very hard.  Initially before going into this commercial activity, she worked as a domestic employee for a family but when her children grew up they didn\u2019t want her to continue with this activity so she used the money she got from her severance pay and bought some articles of clothing that she sold among her friends.  She did very well with them and managed to increase her market and to diversify her offer.\r\n\r\nShe does her purchases in the center of the city when there are important sales, promotions and close-out sales that mean better prices.  This way when she sells them she earns money without having to charge her customers who buy on credit so much.  Two of her children help out collecting payment thus contributing to the business\u2019 operation.\r\n\r\nSonia has an additional productive activity because she buys gallons of arequipe twice or three times a week that she repackages in single serving containers of one ounce each.  This last business has been very well received by her customers who buy them as treats for their children to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe family that Sonia forms with her children is very united which is why every step she takes is supported; she shares expenses with them and they help her out in everything.  Her arequipe sales don\u2019t require fixed assets since she keeps no standing inventory.\r\n\r\nBecause Sonia is aware of opportunities, she also sells fried fast food that she takes to a different neighborhood where she has a sales point one of her children tends to and this is additional income she also receives.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she will use to buy assorted merchandise that\u2019s on special promotion.  Her Kiva loan is a successful investment because it allows her to have money on hand to respond to orders because the time frame she offers her customers sometimes prevents her from being able to respond in a timely fashion to new credit customers and with the Kiva loan this will be possible.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1050656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy assorted merchandise that's on special promotion.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-03-26T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-25T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":63487},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70568},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72215},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73900},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75624},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77389},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79195},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":87622}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.03},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.12},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.12},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.14},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-30T16:42:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":408669,"name":"Orostamo","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u043e \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0425\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0415\u0439 41 \u0433\u043e\u0434. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0443, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0445\u0430. \u0412 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u0448\u0432\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a \u0438 \u0442\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0439.

She tells us that her age hasn't been an obstacle to allowing her to set goals for herself and become independent, rather she has taken advantage of her youth to have a bright future.  She currently works as a receptionist in one of her country's state businesses, but her salary is not sufficient to cover her expenses as everything has gone up.  That is why she currently has a business in her own home in the form of renting out two rooms.  This business has generated extra income for her in addition to her salary and the support she receives from her husband.  As this is her first loan cycle, she explains that her reason for taking out this loan is to fit out the rooms she rents with the goal of having them be her main source of income.  Also, by offering her tenants better conditions, she will be able to increase rent.

Maya\u2019s mother is retired; her aunt has health problems and gets a monthly pension as a person with disabilities. Maya and her brother grow vegetables on a family-owned plot of land. Most of these vegetables are consumed by the family. The family's average monthly income is 170 GEL. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs in the vulnerable poor category. \r\n\r\nMaya used to run a trade business. She imported clothing from a neighboring country and sold it in Kakheti region. She sold directly to consumers, as well as to local clothing stores. But because of a shortage of turnover, she stopped the business. Maya requested credit for re-starting it. Her loan request was approved under the guidelines of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program provides loans for business start-up and re-startup to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit. They are often regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.

They have a milk cow, the dairy products from which are mainly consumed by the family members.  The small surplus is sold in the village. Also the family owns 150 nut trees and they sell nuts in season. The total average monthly income for this 6-member family is 300 Laris, including the monthly pension of Ramaz\u2019s mother. According to Credo estimations, the family belongs to the rural poor. \r\n\r\nRamaz requested credit to purchase 2 hectares of land.  His loan request was approved in the frames of a new joint initiative between Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisioning business start-ups and re-startups with credits with soft conditions to the country's rural poor, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith the received credit, Ramaz will purchase 2 hectares of land.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat only home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to pay for cooking gas and food for one or two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. Aside from this, she also sells silver accessories and processed meat for additional income.She also operates a jeepney unit. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php400 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and also frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \n\nTeresita dreams of a good future for all her children. She wants her business to grow and have more customers. She hopes that her faith in God will continue to grow.  She faithfully attends the weekly fellowship* meetings because she wants to know more about Christ Jesus.  \n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1048359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to pay for raw ingredients and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-26T23:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-25T23:00:09Z","loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-27T01:37:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":405978,"name":"Maria Leonora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Leonora, 39, a resident of Pasong Silang Cavite, Philippines.

He resides in the municipality of Galapa along with his wife and one son who is 11 years old. His experience dates back approximately 21 years, when he learned this business from his father. In his business he sells gels, talcum powder, soaps, toothpaste and personal grooming products in general, to customers in the city of Santa Marta and in the municipality of Galapa, in quantities such as by the dozen and by the box. His market is made up especially of shops and general stores and the occasional housewife, who are constantly placing orders to which Dorian must respond in a timely manner in order to be successful. \r\n\r\nWith the sales from his business, he covers his operating costs and household expenses, leaving a small profit margin which he invests in small quantities of products. However it is not sufficient for him to invest in larger volumes and expand his customer base. Thus he has turned to a Kiva loan, his first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo, through which he will purchase soaps, gels and personal grooming products.
