That is why, now that they are still young (their ages range are from 8 months to 12 years), she and her fisherman husband try to sustain their small business and continue to work hard growing it, hoping that one day it will become stable and profitable.\n\nMary Ann, being the one in charge of the family cash flow and budget, sees to it that food and education are always the priority among other expenses. Though it was easy for her to do that, she also wants to provide her children with nice clothing and other things. Yet, for now, she has to focus on her desire to strengthen their foundation through a good quality of education that they can obtain from school until they graduate from college. Then they will be able to have more opportunities to enhance their own lives someday.\n\nNevertheless, Mary Ann also believes that, in partnership with her husband, one day their fishing and fish-selling business will grow through the loans she can obtain through ASHI, being one of its members. Then, through their business proceeds, she would have money to buy nice things for her children and that would at least inspire them to study harder and maintain a good performance at school.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":565143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

Marinet's weekly income is about 3,000 PHP and she would like to increase it to 4,000Php. With this motivation, she applied for new loan of 40,000 Php to purchase more merchandise for her business and increase her working capital. Marinet has already had previous loans from ASHI and repaid them successfully, therefore she is being entrusted with a much larger loan. An active businesswoman, Marinet is also engaged in a sewing business for added income.\r\n\r\nMarinet has been dedicating herself to expanding her business in order to support her dreams for her family to have a decent way of life.

is Miriam F., 48, resident of Tanza, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Reynaldo Figueroa, a businessman, and mother of five children, one of whom is not going to school yet. By the grace of God, Miriam has managed to support her older children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to send her children to school until they are in college. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Miriam, as she herself was a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave their children.\r\n\r\nMiriam operates a variety store while overseeing operations of their tricycle. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Miriam earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and reselling at a piece rate. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, her tricycle, a sidecar attached to a motorcycle which is used as transportation between narrow streets and off the highways, is being operated by her husband. Miriam\u2019s store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers in her store and for her tricycle are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php14,000 loan.

Hot Y. has been in the farming business for years. She plants various crops to earn a living as well as raises a few pigs, and typically generates an income of $2 per day. Her husband operates a taxi service and fishes as well.\r\n\r\nThis couple has been married for years and has four children. One of the children is married and three are teenagers going to school or work.\r\n\r\nHot Y. finds it hard traveling anywhere because she doesn\u2019t have her own vehicle.

 Th\u1ecb H. (20201030044) is a 30-year-old woman living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, Chu  owns & operates a cloth business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing new cloth to local community members.  Chu  has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Chu  joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Chu  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital.  Chu  is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  Chu  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nChu  Th\u1ecb H.

S. is a 42-year-old woman and has been a member of ASHI (KIVA's first field partner in the Philippines) for five years. Delia is supporting the financial needs of her two children in high school and she hopes to sustain their education until they graduate from college. Presently, she works hard to give them a better kind of life as much as she can give. Delia feels fortunate that she has able to avail loans through ASHI. The loan enabled her to put up her own business and to generate her own income. The proceeds she gets out of her hog raising and native bag making businesses enables her to augment the small and sporadic income of her hired laborer husband. \r\n\r\nDelia has undergone an operation due to an ovarian tumor. However, her health condition could not alter her desire to make her businesses stable and profitable. For as long as she is a member of ASHI and she can avail loans to be invested in her businesses, she will never lose hope of giving her family a comfortable life and a brighter future. Presently, she can still manage to sell her products and grow her piglets. With the love and support of her family, her outlook in life is always positive.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":565287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase

Her desire is to give her children love and education. She states that she feels better each time she provides something small to her children. \r\n<p>\r\nHer inability to get investment capital which could consistently generate income for her to meet her children\u2019s needs is what motivated her to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\u2028\u2028With her loan she plans to buy a two-wheel motorcycle. She knows this business will succeed because she is located at a good business site and she is a good rider for the motorcycle. \r\n<p>\r\nShe plans to use the profits generated to sponsor her children in school and to cater for the basic needs of her family.\u2028She plans to pay her loan in 24 months.

Malvar, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and a rice-retailing business. Her husband, Rogelio P., who is 44 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are from 10 to 16 years old.\r\n\r\nDonna Mae joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wished for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, thus uplifting her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th loan, Donna Mae is borrowing PHP 11,000 which she intends to use to buy rice and additional items for her general store so that she can continue to save for future home repairs and for the education of her children.\r\n\r\nDonna Mae is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":565266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

M. is a 36-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures: pig-fattening, rice-retailing and farming.

By working hard in her pig-fattening, rice-retailing and farming businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 15,000.\r\n\r\nRosie is now borrowing PHP 29,500 so that she can buy more piglets and rice for her businesses. This will be her 8th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 27,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.\r\n\r\nRosie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

M. is a 45-year-old married woman who lives in Sto. Canonoy, Miranda, Isabela, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by  fishing and fish-vending business.\n\nJorema\u2019s 47-year-old husband, Renaldo, is a fisherman and they have seven children who are between 4 to 27 years old. Two of their children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores. The rest of their children already work to help support the family.\n\nJorema joined NWTF-Project Dungganon (NWTF-PD) in 2000 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her fishing and fish-vending business. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 10,000 from her business activities.\n\nJorema is a member of good standing. She used her previous loan of Php 18,000 to add to her working capital so that she could sustainably expand the operations of her fishing and fish-vending business and it had a positive impact on both the business and on the family\u2019s living conditions. Based on previous experience, she anticipates her business turnover to slowdown a bit because of the rainy season, this is the reason why she is borrowing a smaller loan of  Php 10,000 for her 18th loan, the amount she has projected to be enough to continue sustaining her business operations.\n\nJorema is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\n\n\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

G. is a 63-year-old married woman who supports her family by her pig-fattening business. She lives in Barangay Binaliw, Danao City, Cebu City with her 62-year-old husband, Wilfredo, who is a foreman, and their five children who are between 26 and 43 years old.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her pig-fattening business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $330 a month.\r\n\r\nIsabelita is now borrowing 10,000 PHP to use as additional working capital for her business. This will be her 8th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 20,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Isabelita aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She has been very hardworking from the day she joined GHAPE. She explained how good it is for a woman to work for herself and care for the children, even if her work is just the buying and selling of cocoa yams (a root vegetable also known as taro). \r\n\r\nHer desire is to work for her children\u2019s education and pay for their apprenticeships so that they may learn a trade. She decided to become a member of GHAPE due to her inability to get investment capital that could give her a higher income to meet her children\u2019s needs and those of the family. \r\n\r\nWith this loan of 200,000 XAF, she plans to buy cocoa yams, groundnuts and other products to sell. This investment will help people in her community buy their food right at their doorsteps. She will also greatly help the poor who will not have to travel as far to purchase their daily needs. She is planning to use the profits generated to sponsor her children in school. \r\n\r\nShe plans to pay the loan within 12 months. The first installment repayment shall start on the same day of disbursal.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works toward the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":565369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of groundnuts, cocoa yams, cassava and palm oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntarikon, Bamenda, NW.

Maria Eufrocina, 47, has two children who are 15 and 11 years old, respectively.  Five months ago, she joined the Trabajando en Armonia (\"Working in Harmony\") community bank, a group of 10 members, all residents of the La Flor neighborhood of Carabayllo.\r\n\r\nSra. Maria started her business three years ago, making and selling salchipapas (a local hotdog-like dish), by setting up a table outside the door of her house.  Whenever there was an event going on in the neighborood, she made the most of it to increase her sales.  After a time, one of her sons began studying pastry-making so she set up a stand to display her son's pastries.\r\n\r\nSra. Maria believes this business will be much more profitable and provide her a way to pay for her children to go to school.  She is also supporting a niece who is in her care.  Her next goal is to start a restaurant.  She wants to set the restaurant up in a space at her house so that she can avoid paying rent.\r\n\r\nSra. Maria will use this loan to buy wholesale supplies of the products she needs to make salchipapas: sacks of potatoes, supplies of hotdogs, condiments, paper plates and cooking oil.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":565413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"Supplies for food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Carabayllo-Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.853333 -77.037778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-07-09T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Eufrocina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Kajrin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gardenia Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose De Los Santos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melaneo Olidon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Constantina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nilda Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Milagros","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Correa Freyre","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5200,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1040},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1040},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1040},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1040},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1040}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":370,"local_amount":1040,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617204,"comment":null},{"amount":370,"local_amount":1040,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831539,"comment":null},{"amount":370,"local_amount":1040,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098080,"comment":null},{"amount":370,"local_amount":1040,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390750,"comment":null},{"amount":370,"local_amount":1040,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529037,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-19T08:54:05Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":213253,"name":"Martin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martin, tiene 39 a\u00f1os y pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLos Comerciantes de Virgen Asunta\u201d de la Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa de la ciudad del Cusco de Per\u00fa.  \n\nMartin nos cuenta.- En mi banco comunal somos 10 integrantes y me eligieron a m\u00ed para dar mi testimonio de mi actividad econ\u00f3mica.

She began by selling these products; now she prepares and sells spices, condiments, and salsas, and thus her earnings have increased. Her store is located in a small space within her home, where she warmly serves her customers. She is very happy with her business, given that it allows her to take care of her children.

He rents a house with his wife Nidia, 27, and their 2 young children, to whom he wishes to provide a better quality of life. Farming has been a crucial part of Edwin's life. Since he was very young, Edwin's parents taught him that farming would provide him with everything he needed, which is why he decided to continue the work. He now has his own farm of potatoes and peas, which he sells in Tarma's wholesale market after harvest.\r\n\r\nEdwin started his farm 5 years ago and really enjoys the planting season. His family depends on his work for economic security. Climate changes affect his yield, so he tries to take good care of his crops. Edwin hopes to keep working and improving his crops. This is his 4th loan with MFP and he knows how important it is to the development of his work. In his community group Edwin is very responsible, which has earned him a lot of respect. With the 3,000 PEN loan he is requesting, Edwin will buy fertilizer to improve his harvest.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva

Felicia grows peas and potatoes with her husband, who also works hard to earn income for his family. Felicia sells her products in Tarma's wholesale market, where she gets the best profit margin. \r\n\r\nWhat Felicia likes most about her work is preventing the crop pests that threaten her yield. She has been working in the countryside for 40 years and considers transportation of her products the most difficult part of her work, because the road is long and exhausting. Over time, she hopes to buy more land to increase her production and improve income. This is her 4th loan with MFP and she feels obligated to make her repayments on time, since she doesn't want to cause problems for the other members of her community group, where she is well-respected.

She lives in her own home along with her 25 year old husband Leonardo, and two young children who are the motive for all her efforts.  Every day from early in the morning she works growing potatoes and beans.   The earnings that she receives from her crops are good as she sells them in the Tarma market where they pay her well.  What she likes most about her work is harvesting as she can see the results of her hard work in the fields.  She has been doing this activity for the past 6 years and considers the most difficult part is guarding her plants from the diseases that affect production.  In the future, she will plant the entire space that she has in the countryside in order to increase her earnings.  This is the third loan she has had with MFP and this assistance has helped her greatly in the progress of her work.  In her communal group she is well loved by the rest of her companions as she is very loyal to them.

They dedicate themselves to many different kinds of businesses, like the sewing of pajamas and sweatshirts, dessert making, jewelry making, the sale and repair of eyeglasses, the sale of undergarments, the preparation and sale of breads and cakes, sculpting and auto repair.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica, the group\u2019s treasurer, is seen in the photo on the right-hand side, wearing a burgundy-colored jacket. M\u00f3nica works with her father in the business he has run for 30 years.

She will also purchase aluminum plates, oil, and cheese in bulk, along with papaya jam and dough for the <i>sopaipillas<\/i> and <i>empanadas<\/i>.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to incorporate new products into the business; for example, an ice cream machine as they do not currently have one and it would be a good investment for the summer months to take advantage of the businesses location. In general, she would like to grow the business.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica\u2019s motivation comes from her children. She has one son who is 20 and in his third year of university, studying electrical engineering, and she has a 15-year-old daughter who also wants to continue on to college after finishing high school.  Her other daughter, who is 28, sells jewelry and is also part of the Fondo Esperanza communal bank.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica very much enjoys attending the weekly meetings of their bank because it gives her a moment to share with her friends and a distraction from day-to-day activities. \r\n\r\nValpara\u00edso is a city situated 120 kilometers to the northwest of Santiago, on the Chilean coast.  It is the regional capital of  \"Region Five\" and is the seat of the Chilean legislative government. Valpara\u00edso is the nation's primary port, and in addition to a bustling economy, it offers a great variety of beautiful and picturesque places, like the home of Nobel Laureate, the poet Pablo

She lives with her husband and two children in their own house. For more than twenty years, she has been producing artisan embroideries and items of clothing typical to the area. From the comfort of her own home, she splits her time between carrying out the domestic tasks and spending time on this artisan craft. During the festive seasons, between June and July, the demand for these embroideries increases, along with her income. She enjoys her work very much; for her it is a hobby and allows her to demonstrate her ability to make good use of colours in her embroideries. She therefore does not intend to stop working and wants to progress further and further with her business. This is her ninth loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has a means of financial support as she has always proved to be responsible with her payments. She is also grateful to be part of her communal group because all of its members are responsible and supportive people. She will invest the loan requested in the purchase of materials such as threads and fabrics to continue her embroidery.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Stansfield, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":565623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy fabrics and threads.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-10T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yudy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":218.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":233.44},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":244.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":256.9},{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":267.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":279.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.59},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.2},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80.18,"local_amount":218.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":226.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673554,"comment":null},{"amount":85.59,"local_amount":233.44,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":241.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887373,"comment":null},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":244.31,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:36Z","rounded_local_amount":252.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154384,"comment":null},{"amount":94.2,"local_amount":256.9,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":265.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449679,"comment":null},{"amount":98.13,"local_amount":267.62,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":277.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588388,"comment":null},{"amount":102.32,"local_amount":279.06,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":288.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724874,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-10T16:55:11Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":213326,"name":"Maria Juana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1oras.

In the afternoons, her mother sells \u201ccachangas\u201d (a type of bread made from wheat flour) and \u201cchamp\u00fas\u201d (a hot beverage made from corn).  \r\n<p>\r\nLeslie always serves the drivers and anyone else who travels near the area.  Her good service and the delicious flavor of the food that she prepares have brought her local recognition.  Each day she has more customers to serve.  Leslie is requesting her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 600 PEN so that she can buy more supplies to prepare her dishes and increase her sales.\r\n<p>\r\nLeslie is an enterprising and earnest young woman.  Using the income she earns from her work, she is able to pay for her studies at the local institute.  Her neighbors and friends consider her to be a peaceful and responsible person.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":565650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase supplies for her food business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Paijan -

Tirelessly making and selling her candy directly to people in the market to earn money for herself and her two children, Amparo also accepts as many orders for her product as she can accommodate.  She sometimes has to turn down orders due to insufficient capital, the same problem that affects her hog-raising business. Her desired growth for a hog after four months or so is often not achieved because she can\u2019t afford to buy the necessary food. This in turn reduces the profits she is trying to earn to make her life as well as her children\u2019s comfortable. <p>\r\n\r\nAlthough Amparo\u2019s two children are already 29 and 37 years old, she still feels responsible for making their lives worth living for. Her 29-year-old daughter, a high school graduate, is a contract-based sales lady in one of the stores in the province. Her other child is a special child who needs her financial and emotional support. With these considerations, Amparo would like to request a loan to finance her plan to grow her businesses. Once they are stable, she will have a valuable inheritance for her children to enrich and maintain in the future. Despite the fact that she is an elderly widow, her love and concern for her two children provide her with the strength to live and continue dreaming.\r\n

P. is from the village of Baylao, Mambajao, Camiguin Province. She is 30 years old. Rubelyn is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Rubelyn owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food & daily use products  and also selling different kinds of vegetables especially spices in the local community. Rubelyn has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.

Eleanora is 36 years old. She grew up in a low-income family, which is why she was unable to continue her studies after graduating from high school and began to help her parents with housework. When she was 27, Eleanora married and gave birth to a son one year later. Now her son is already 8 and studies in a rural school. Eleanora works as a freelance associate editor at the local rural newspaper \u201cNarodnaya Tribuna\u201d (The Peoples\u2019 Tribune). Eleanora\u2019s husband works as a security guard. Their income is hardly enough for their small family.\r\n\r\nLike many other people in the village, Eleanora and her husband decided to do animal husbandry. With initial capital of only 15,000 Kyrgyz Soms, the family bought a cow in 2001. With the first earnings from the sale of milk, the family finally reached a stable income. Now Eleanora wakes up without worrying where to get money to feed her family, provide her son with clothes and prepare him for school. \r\n\r\nEleanora's parents helped her buy a house in the same village. After getting her own home Eleanora pondered over the expansion of her business. Her son is getting older and to allow him to study at a good university, she needs to start saving money today. Eleanora wants to use her loan of 80,000 Kyrgyz Soms to buy another cow to increase milk production, as well as 4 bull-calves and 5 sheep for fattening and resale. \r\n\r\nThis hard-working and optimistic woman would like to have another child and sign up her son to a sports section and give him a good education. Because all of this is very costly, Eleanora plans to significantly expand her business in order to always wake up in the morning with confidence and \"a penny in her pocket\u201d.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

With three years of experience she now masters her business and is in great demand. \r\n\r\nIn her search for complementary financial resources she decided to collaborate with the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso. Following one group loan, she decided to go for an individual loan. She is planning to use this loan to buy fabrics and bed sheets. She gets her supplies in Burkina Faso. Her customer base is made up of local people. With this loan, she is hoping to make a monthly profit of 37,000FCFA which will allow her to improve her business and to pay the interest. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":565783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchase of fabrics and bed sheets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-07-08T09:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:05Z","rounded_local_amount":34521.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180824,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34521.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613504,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":34521.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606182,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":34521.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360744,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:59:37Z","rounded_local_amount":34521.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301053,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":34521.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580699,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-08T13:04:27Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":213425,"name":"Ramata","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Ramata Kon\u00e9 est une femme mari\u00e9e de 38 ans et m\u00e8re de 6 enfants.

Vumilia N. is an entrepreneur who produces a local drink known as \"Rutuku\". On the photo, she is the one raising her hand, with a little smile. An excellent client of the Sheria solidarity group (Sheria means laws, regulations), she is 50, a widow and mother of five children, four girls and a boy. The boy is the youngest and he attends 6th grade. The four girls have their own homes. A. lives in the village of Kiziba II, a shantytown on the outskirts of Goma, a commune of Nyiragongo. Her husband died in 2006 after a lengthy battle against diabetes. \r\n\r\nRutuku is basically an alcoholic beverage about 47% proof, brewed from a mixture of fermented cassava flour, maize, sorghum, etc. It is heated to more than 180C in a vessel connected to a locally-designed chimney pipe. The droplets resulting from the evaporation process are collected in a bowl and cooled to achieve the taste of strong Whiskey liquor, which the customers enjoy. \r\n \r\nA. started her business with her own money, an initial capital of $20. Soon after, she found out about the Hekima MFI and received her first loan of $50 to strengthen her business. With a new loan from the Hekima MFI, A. hopes to increase her sales by buying two bags of maize, two bags of cassava flour, about ten stacks of firewood, etc. \r\n\r\nA. has explained that the main challenges of producing the local beverage Rutuku are the sales on credit and the lack or scarcity of firewood, especially now that the state has already taken steps to impose criminal sanctions on anyone who harms the environment (people selling wood from the national park). Moreover, when the mixture of ingredients doesn\u2019t dissolve properly, the customers don\u2019t like the beverage and are reluctant to buy it. \r\n\r\nGiven her advancing age and the harsh conditions surrounding the production of the beverage, A. wants to make changes to her activities by adding a new business selling clothes and various items from Kampala, Uganda. She also plans to build a comfortable house on her plot. \r\n\r\nA. is grateful for the loans that the Hekima MFI grants her without any material guarantees because these funds allow her to support herself and provide for the needs of her children and grandsons. She recognizes the Hekima MFI as the local bank dedicated to helping the poor and the widows. \r\n\r\nThe Sheria group consists of 17 female members. All members are wearing a uniform in solidarity and unity to commemorate the International Women\u2019s Day of March 8, 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier,

Saodatjon is 52 years old and a widow with three children. She makes dried apricots and processes the stones to sell at the local market. This is her main income and it provides a steady cash flow.

She is requesting a loan which will be used to restock her inventory of dried apricots. Saodatjon will be happy if she can get this loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Longevity in this cutthroat business normally points to individual hallmarks of hard work, constant planning, resilience, determination and a creative vision. If you take the example of 44-year-old N. Tausi, then you have got a clear testimony to the above. \r\n\r\nThis happy-go-lucky and affable married mother of six has brought profit grist to her business mill, selling fish all these years. Her business status at present reads like a rags-to-riches success story. With savings from her first farming business, which she still operates at a small scale, Tausi was able to set forth on this business. Casting her mind back, she says her farming business was not as lucrative as this one. She says she had to grapple with a lot of financial difficulty at that time. \r\n\r\nAs of now, she is planning on building a better family house if her prospects improve with this loan. In a month, her profits total up to 240,000 shillings (about $106).

C. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Looc, Argao, Cebu City. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: selling cellphone accessories and selling ready-to-wear clothes. Her 24-year-old husband, James D. C., works as a technician to earn a living, and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have one child who is seven years old. \n\nCharisse joined Kiva partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her eight previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Charisse has been gradually lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 8,000 PHP helped her earn a profit of 32,000 PHP, raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future, to improve her business and pay for her daughter's education. Charisse D.

This time, for her 16th loan cycle, she is borrowing 17,500 PHP which she intends to use for additional working capital for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future.

Como es oriunda de la sierra peruana, sus padres le proveen de estos comestibles y tambi\u00e9n de  alverjas y papas, de acuerdo a la temporada,  ella los comercializa  a sus vecinos y conocidos.

","en":"Vitalia is a very hard-working 35 year old mother.  She lives in her own house with her husband and their two children.  She works as a nurse 3 days a week, and works selling cheese and sweets the other days.  As she is originally from the mountain range of Peru, her parents provide her with those food items, as well as peas and potatoes when they are in season.  She sells them to her neighbors and acquaintances.  Her customers are often the nurses and doctors at the clinic where she works, as well as some patients.  Every time they request more products from her.  She never imagined she would be able to provide for herself every 2 weeks selling these products as she does.  She feels very happy with the work that she does, and she has been working there for 5 years.  In the future she plans to fulfill her greatest desire--installing a bookstore in her house, and she also wants to build a house of sturdier material.  This is her 12th loan with MFP and she knows that the loan will be very helpful in increasing her capital.  She is committed to repaying the loan on time, especially because she does not want to cause harm to her group members who have helped her from the beginning.  Vitalia plans to invest the loan money in buying cheese, sweets, and bread in bulk in order to stock her supplies and fill her customers' orders.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":565938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy food for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-11T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vitalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":217.02},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":221.01},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":231.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":244.08},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":253.4},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":266.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":278.46},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":288.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.48},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.86},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.59},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":78.67,"local_amount":217.02,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":222.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673559,"comment":null},{"amount":80.12,"local_amount":221.01,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":226.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887378,"comment":null},{"amount":83.84,"local_amount":231.29,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:26Z","rounded_local_amount":236.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154389,"comment":null},{"amount":88.48,"local_amount":244.08,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":249.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449684,"comment":null},{"amount":91.86,"local_amount":253.4,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":259.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588393,"comment":null},{"amount":96.59,"local_amount":266.46,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":272.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724878,"comment":null},{"amount":100.94,"local_amount":278.46,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":285.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463021,"comment":null},{"amount":104.5,"local_amount":288.28,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":295.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886531,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-11T06:47:00Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":213493,"name":"Rosendo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosendo de 39 a\u00f1os, vive en la Primavera de Duran (zona periurbana, con una ecolog\u00eda en disoluci\u00f3n).

She decided to pursue this line of work after she had the opportunity to learn tailoring at a local church.  They have worked with EDAPROSPO for 3 years.  The members operate a range of businesses: sales of prepared food, juices, sweets, and clothes.  Rubi is buying, with a recent loan, materials (fabric, thread, needles, etc.) to make the products she sells.  The other members will increase their capital so that they become more productive or gain a better position in the market or capture more customers.

The fields that they work are their own and rented ones and these yield considerable income that they use for household expenses, their children's education, and especially to save money.\r\nFrom the cows that she carefully cares for, she is able to extract milk that she uses to make cheese, and then sell the cheese in local stores and at weekly markets.

Mar\u00eda takes advantage of any free time she has to peel chili peppers so that she can earn additional income for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda plans to continue developing as a person and making her business grow.  She wants to buy more products in greater variety so that she can satisfy the demands of her customers.  Her dream is to see her business continue to grow, like a tree, and see it converted into a supermarket. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva
