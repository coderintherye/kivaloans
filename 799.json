Since the death of his father, Edgar wants to take care of his mother; for this reason he seeks a loan from MFP to buy a plot of land for he and his mother to live on. This will be his 1st credit with MFP and he is committed to prompt repayment. With 2,000 nuevos soles he will be able to buy a plot of land and live happily with his mother.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1008436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy a plot of land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-02T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-01T23:20:02Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":305.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":314.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":327.78},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":339.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":350.48},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":361.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.71},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.26},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-14T02:35:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":399240,"name":"Tojimurod","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0422\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433. \u041a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435- \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u041f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043c\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0445\u043e\u0437\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440. \u0412 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435 \u043e\u043d \u0443\u0436\u0435 31 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0431\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441. \u0422\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 5000 \u0421\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0438\u0445. \u041e\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0443.

For the last three years Stanislav has been growing early vegetables - tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes. Previously Stanislav lived in a big city in eastern Ukraine, but there was little work to be found there. That is why Stanislav moved to Kamenka and started his farming business.

Due to adverse conditions in rural areas, she was unable to receive proper education and so is unemployed. In order to somehow improve her living conditions, she raises livestock at home.

She tells us that she is requesting this loan to sell traditional clothing because the school year started and she wants to buy blouses to sell them. Furthermore, she also wants to invest in her french fries business because she wants to change the stove since the one she has is a little old. So she wants to send it to be repaired so she can continue selling because she is the only one in her sector who has this type of business. So on the weekends the people already know her and they come and they buy from her.\r\n\r\nThere is also Lidia del Rosario, she is 29 years old. She has two children in elementary school. She sells new and used traditional clothing and she also makes aprons. She has done this for 7 years. She tells us that in her sector where she lives she makes different types of needlework and people come to ask for them.

This will improve Amneh's son's health and allow him to live with the family in better conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1007863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical Expenses","sector":"Health","use":"To pay for her son's medical expenses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PS","country":"Palestine","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"31.92157 35.203285","type":"point"}},"partner_id":80,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T00:50:04Z","loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amneh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40.35},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41.08},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":42.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":43.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":44.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":44.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45.76},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":47.43},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50.06},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50.97},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":51.9},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":52.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53.8},{"due_date":"2013-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2013-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":55.76},{"due_date":"2013-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":56.78},{"due_date":"2013-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":59.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":61.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.94},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.97},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.9},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.84},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.8},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.76},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.81},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.92},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-04T22:45:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393409,"name":"C13024 Umurava,, Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celestin is 36 years old, married and has three children between the ages of four and ten.

In addition, he hopes that in this way, he will be able to generate greater income for his household, with which he will be able to improve the quality of life for his wife and son, and offer them greater opportunities for progress."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1007352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy agricultural supplies for growing his crops, such as fertilizers, irrigation equipment, greenhouse plastic sheeting, and other things.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Marinilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T01:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T01:30:04Z","loan_amount":1700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hernan De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":89095},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":91610},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":94196},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":96855},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":99589},{"due_date":"2012-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":102400},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":105290},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":108262},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":111318},{"due_date":"2012-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":114460},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":117691},{"due_date":"2013-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":121013},{"due_date":"2013-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":124429},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":127941},{"due_date":"2013-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":131553},{"due_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":135266},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":139084},{"due_date":"2013-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":143010},{"due_date":"2013-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":147047},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":151198},{"due_date":"2013-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":155466},{"due_date":"2013-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":159854},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":164366},{"due_date":"2014-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":169007}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.49},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-25T22:25:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":392510,"name":"Saeed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saeed is a 50-year-old married man from Irbid, Jordan and a father of two children.\r\n\r\nSaeed is looking to improve his family's living conditions.

She is also a kind and sociable person who knows how to win the appreciation of the people with her charisma.  She lives with Manuel who is retired and the father of her 3 children, Niki, Ray and Jaqueline, at 19, 17 and 15 years of age respectively.  Together they live in their own house that they built with their efforts.  The activity that Zoila performs is dressmaking, an occupation that she learned by studying at a center for youth employment education, but which she did not at first pursue.  More than 10 years ago she took up dressmaking again.  Starting with one machine, she currently relies on more than 6 sewing machines for different finishes, offering quality work to her clients that leave satisfied and recommend her to other people.  She also sells clothes that she buys in the capital or that she makes, having in her business a space where she exhibits her products.  She carries out her work in her house, where her clients come and she attends them kindly.  She considers her business quite profitable due to the profits that she earns and the demand for her products.  Up to now she has worked alone, except from time to time when she supports her daughter who is learning to sew.  She decided to begin with this activity when she lost her job and needed a position to generate an income, besides which her neighbors requested her work when they saw her fine finished clothing.

She is married to Noah who is a teacher and the father of her children, Alex, Carlos and Luis, ages 32, 30 and 28 respectively.  Together they live in their own house that they bought with their savings of many years.  The activity that Dora carries out is renting rooms and houses.  She has  land where she built two houses, one which is rented and the other with small rooms to rent, all occupied.  Her business was started 3 years ago with capital from her own savings, that she invested in their house thinking about their future including the support of their children that help her with the administration.  She considers it a quite profitable business due to the demand and that all her room s are occupied, and that it is work that does not need a lot of physical effort.  She decided to begin her business seeing that she was getting advanced in age and had the need to earn her own income to live on since she would not have access to employment or retirement.  Seeing the opportunity for the business, and the profits that it is achieving she is encouraged to invest in the purchase of more land to build a tourist hotel in the future.  This will be her 12th loan with MFP.  She is grateful to know that she can continue to count on financial support to advance with her business.  Besides she tells us that she is comfortable with her communal bank where she knows its members and considers them to be kind and responsible people.  With the requested total of 2000 new soles she will invest in the purchase of a pump for water valued at 1500 new soles to offer good service to her boarders so they will have permanent water service.

She lives with her partner Luis who is a salesman and the father of her three children Jouliet, Luis and Luciano, who are 7, 5 and 1 and who she loves very much.  They live comfortably together in a rental house together with her sister and her nephew.\r\n\r\nAna's business is selling regional fruit and different flavored drinks.  Every day she sets up a table in front of her home where she places her fruit and drinks and then offers them for sale.  Her business is popular thanks to her kind manner and the good flavor of her drinks.  Ana started this business more than two years ago with a loan from MFP and, up to now, she has been working alone.  However, her sister sometimes supports her.  She considers her business to be fairly profitable because of the income it makes her and how popular it is.  She decided to start this business because she needed work which would allow her to make her own income.  Sometimes her partner's income wasn't enough and so she took the decision to help him with their household expenses so that they could provide their children with a better quality of life.  Now that she sees the good results she is having, she would like to continue in her business and also start selling groceries.  She would like to open a store in her home for this.\r\n\r\nThis will be Ana's third loan from MFP.  She feels grateful for the financial support that she receives as it makes her feel more secure in making progress with her plans.  She also comments that she feels happy with her community bank as she considers its members to be cooperative and responsible.  Ana will invest the 1,000 soles she has requested in buying soda to stock her business.  She will also buy a variety of fruit, seeking out affordable prices for her purchases so that she makes more profits."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1009351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy soda and fruit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T11:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T11:30:07Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":146.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":160.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":159.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":172.24},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":182.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.01},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.99},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-08T10:50:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393512,"name":"Teymur","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teymur is forty-seven years old and married with two children.

She lives with her two youngest daughters, ages 12 and 16. The oldest is independent and lives with her own family. She lives with her partner in their own home. She wants to provide her daughters with a better quality of life and offer them a good education. \r\n\r\nThe work that Nimia does is very complex. Her two occupations are selling fast food and ice-cold drinks. She has to get up early in the morning to seek out the largest, freshest chickens at the best prices. Then she prepares everything so that in the evening, she can sell along the path at her house with the help of her two daughters. She has worked in this business for over two years, and she likes it a lot because she can do her work alongside her daughters. She has taught her daughters from an early age to value responsibility without neglecting their studies. She feels that the business is worthwhile since she sells at least five chickens a day, generating a good income. When she started with the work, it was a little complicated since she did not know much yet. Before, she used to sell groceries. But with determination and energy, she was able to learn. Now she has one of the most exquisite fast foods in the city. One of the things that she would like to achieve is to grow her business and make it larger every day. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP, so she hopes that though this collaboration she will be able to continue towards her goals. She commits once again to making her loan payments, just as she did with her previous loans. In addition, she is thankful to be a part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and united.

She is also cheerful and kind to others.  She is married to Javier who is a teacher and the father of her children: 22-year-old Luis, 18-year-old Marvin and 8-year-old Karen.  They live comfortably together in their own home that Doylibeth bought with the support of her husband.\r\n\r\nDoylibeth's business is making and knitting clothing, tablecloths and bedspreads.  She learned this skill from her grandmother when she was very young.  She makes her items at home and sells them to her friends and family members, providing them with good customer service and thereby gaining their loyalty.  She also sells clothing, that her daughter sends her from the capital, at affordable prices.  Up to now she has been working alone but her children sometimes support her in collecting payment for her items.  She considers her business to be fairly profitable owing to the demand that she has for her products and the speed of her capital turnover.  This allows her to see her profits very quickly.  She decided to start her business because she needed an income to cover her expenses and pay for her children's education as her husband's salary wasn't enough to meet their increasing expenses.  Seeing the good results that she has experienced, she would now like to start another business, opening a grocery store in her home.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Doylibeth's fifth loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive a small loan so that she can achieve her goals.  She enjoys belonging to her community bank because all the members are responsible and very supportive people.  She will invest the 1,800 soles she has requested in buying clothing to sell.  She will buy at low prices because she will buy in bulk.  She will also buy materials with which to repair to house, creating an environment in which she can set up her grocery store."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1009375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more clothing and also materials for repairing her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T11:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T11:50:04Z","loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doyliveth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":260.84},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":287.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":298.4},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":300.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":320.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":331.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.82},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.9},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-13T18:09:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393522,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick is a businessman and married with one child.

She has a great desire to make progress and offer her family a better quality of life.  She is married to Isaac who is an employee and receives a regular income.  He is the father of her three children who are 14, 7 and 3 and who she loves very much.  They live together comfortably in their own home which they worked very hard to build.\r\n\r\nHilma's business is selling ladies' beauty products such as make-up, hair dyes, nail polish, lipsticks, perfumes, etc.  All of these products are bought through a catalog and sold from her home to family members, friends and neighbors.  She also provides home delivery.  Her business stands out because of the kind and friendly way in which she deals with her customers who end up satisfied and then recommend her to other people who, over time, become regular customers.  Hilma started this business more than four years ago and, up to now, she has worked alone both in selling her products and in collecting payment for them.\r\n\r\nHilma considers her business to be fairly profitable because of the good profits she makes and the regular customers that she has managed to attract.  She didn't have any financial problems before she started her business but she decided to take the plunge and start her own business so that she would have something to keep her busy in her free time, which would make her feel like a successful, independent businesswoman.  Seeing the good results she has experienced, Hilma now hopes to increase her stock and grow her business.\r\n\r\nThis will be Hilma's seventh loan from MFP.  She is happy to know that she will have the financial support she needs to continue carrying out her plans.  For her part, she pledges to be punctual in making her repayments as she has been with her previous loans.  She says that she feels happy with her community bank as she knows the members and considers them to be kind and supportive people.  Hilma will invest the 1,000 soles she has requested in buying merchandise so that she can increase the stock she has available for sale.  She will seek low prices because she is buying in bulk.  This will make her more profits."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1009394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T12:40:02Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":147.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":159.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":165.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":166.53},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":177.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":183.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-15T13:26:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":393578,"name":"C8057 Ubufatanye Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jean de Dieu is thirty-nine years old and is married with four children between the ages of three and ten.

She is also kind and friendly. She lives together with Jos\u00e9 who is employed and the father of their 4 children, Lindolfo, Grecia, Julia y Mar\u00eda, ages 19, 15, 11 and 3 respectively. They live together comfortably in their own home that they purchased with much effort. \r\n\r\nJulia\u2019s work is selling soda of different flavors and brands. She sells out of her house, and she has a refrigerator that keeps the drinks ice-cold, just the way her customers like them in the hot climate of the area. She tends to her customers with a friendly and pleasant manner. She started her business over three years ago using her own capital, buying and selling in small quantities. She continued to increase her purchases as demand increased. Now she continues working alone. She thinks her business is definitely worthwhile because of the good earnings it provides her. In addition, the constant consumption makes her capital keep turning over. \r\n\r\nJulia decided to start her business when she saw how the cost of consumer goods and food have continued to be more and more expensive, so much so that the income of her partner is no longer enough. As a mother, she took note of this difficulty and decided to support her partner and help her family get ahead. After seeing the good results that she has had, she wants to continue with her business and increase the amount of inventory to make the business grow. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 4th loan with MFP. She feels both happy and thankful to have the financial support to continue with her plans. She likes and feels comfortable with her communal bank. She knows the members and considers them to be responsible people. With the 1200 Nuevos Soles (PEN) requested, she will invest in a large quantity of merchandise to have more inventory available for sale. She will look for lower prices for her purchases so that she can have better earnings. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1009369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"purchase a variety of sodas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":175.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":192.15},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":191.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":206.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":214.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":220}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.94},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.78},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.31},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-14T15:53:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394290,"name":"Micaela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Micaela es casada, tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, no tuvo la oportunidad de estudiar, tiene 6 hijos 1 de los cuales estudian, se dedica a la panader\u00eda, inicio siendo operaria y hasta el momento lle4va 10 a\u00f1os de experiencia, cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo quien se dedica a la tejedur\u00eda.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizara para la compra de harina, az\u00facar, ajonjol\u00ed, decorativos, etc. Espera en el futuro tener un negocio prospero.\n\n","en":"Micaela is 48 years old and married.

She has a great desire to get ahead and to triumph in life.  She is married to Carlos, a transportation worker, and he is the father of their six children.  The children are ages 18, 17, 8, and 3 year old triplets.  They live together in a rented house.  She loves them dearly, and they are her motivation to work more as she looks to give them a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nElith sells medicine and other health products.  To do this she has a drugstore that she opened in a rented spot in the same place as the house that she rents.  This saves her more rental expenses.  She started her business over one year ago.  Her husband supports her with the money that she needed to buy the necessary merchandise.  There is a health clinic located in front of her business, and many times they do not have the medicines that the patients request.\r\n\r\nShe feels that her business is profitable because of the good income it gives her and the regular clientele that she has.  Before having her business she encountered financial hardships.  Her family grew very rapidly with the arrival of the triplets, and their expenses grew.  Their income was not enough, so they looked at alternative solutions.  They decided on this business.  Now it is going well for them, and they have overcome many of their financial hardships.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they have plans to continue and to make it grow by getting more merchandise in order to have stock available to sell.\r\n\r\nThis will be her seventh loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she can count on a loan to advance with her business.

She is also cheerful and sociable. She is separated from the father of her children. She lives comfortably with her two children, who are 25 and 28 years old, in the home of her mother, along with two newphews and their mother, all of whom she loves a great deal. Mar\u00eda's business activity is a printing service where she performs all types of graphical work, providing her customers with a high-quality service that earns her their business.\r\n\r\nShe began 30 years ago with her own capital. She saw that this would be a profitable business, given that there were few people providing this service, so she decided to open a printing business in her house. She obtained the machinery with her own capital, in partnership with her ex-partner. She currently has the support of her brother and his children to attend to the customers. She likes this business because it lets her see her family working together, provides her with income, and allows her to support herself. On the other hand, every day she finds this work more tiring due to her advanced age and a disease that has been affecting her for some time. She knows, however, that she needs to continue, as it is her only source of income. As well, she has plans with her children to expand the business and add a bookstore in the space that she has available in her house, in an attempt to increase her income. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP. Because of this she is hoping for their collaboration so that she can finalize her plans. As well, she says that she feels comfortable with her communal bank because she considers them to be responsible and supportive people. With the requested amount of 1500 nuevos soles (PEN), she will invest in the purchase of materials to expand and prepare the space for the bookstore. With the balance, she will purchase printing materials, such as ink, card stock, and other items. She will be looking for the lowest prices to make her purchases in bulk with cash payment.

She is separated from the father of her children. She lives in her own house with her children, ages 15, 13, and 8, whom she loves a lot and wants to bring up well. Emma's business is the sale of secondhand clothing for women, men, and children. She acquires all these products in the commercial center of the city, and she sells them as a walking vendor, going through the little outlying towns located on the edges of the banks of the rivers. To do this, she travels until she finishes selling all her merchandise, no matter how long it takes. She began this business six years ago, investing some capital of her own, the fruit of her savings, because of the need to have an income to support her children, since the allowance that their father sends them is not sufficient. But now she has managed to increase her capital and she has the help of her son, who accompanies her on her sales.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business profitable because of the good earnings she obtains, since she sells at higher prices in these areas; in addition, she likes to sell and deal with people. For this reason, she plans to continue her business and expand into selling factory-made clothing, and in the future she would like to open a store to sell clothing in the city of Pucallpa, since she gets tired making her trips. This will be her fourth loan with MFP. For this she hopes for your help so that she can realize her plans. In addition, she comments that she feels good about her communal bank because she knows its members and considers them responsible and united people. With the 1800 PEN that she has applied for, she will invest in the purchase of merchandise for her business, such as secondhand women's, men's, and children's clothing. Thus she will have an available stock for sale, and she will seek lower prices by making her purchases in volume.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1009423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more secondhand clothing for women, men, and children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":264.06},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":288.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":287.48},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":310.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":321.61},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":328.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-05T16:50:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394452,"name":"Kawthar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kawthar is a 49-year-old woman and a mother to five. \r\n\r\nKawthar has been embroidering and knitting clothes for sale to help her husband in supporting the family.

This large but united family lives in a house in the native community of Inchatingari in the Peren\u00e9 district, Chanchamayo province.\r\n\r\nHermelinda is a businesswoman.  Twenty years ago she started working in the fields.  During this large amount of time she acquired 12 parcels of land, which are spread out in different parts of her locality.  On those parcels she produces citrus like oranges and lemons.  She also produces coffee and annatto.  As her crops can be found at considerable distances from her home, she gets up early in the morning to get to her crops on time.\r\n\r\n\u201cI harvest 20 sacks of coffee a year, and each sack is 60 to 70 kilos,\u201d she says.  She knows very well how she needs to manage her production.  For example, she harvests coffee in April, May, and June.  She harvests annatto in October and November, and she harvests oranges in December and November.  This way she generates income for her family for almost the whole year.\r\n\r\nHermelinda is intelligent.  She is now planning on planting another parcel of coffee.  In order to do so she needs to buy fertilizers and coffee seedlings.  \r\n\r\nHer hope is to see her children become independent and mature people.  Therefore, she will not rest from her work in order to give them what they need  to obtain their goals.\r\n\r\nThis is Hermelinda\u2019s third loan with MFP, thanks to your help.  She pledges to make her monthly payments punctually as she did before.  Los Productores Inchatingari is the name of her communal bank.  She is happy to be part of a supportive group.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money to pay day workers who she will contract to clear the weeds from her crops.  She will also buy orange seedlings for 3 soles and 50 c\u00e9ntimos and some coffee plants.  This way she will start new crops.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1010153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy coffee and orange plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hermelinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-05T00:44:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394471,"name":"Olga","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Olga de 31 a\u00f1os se separ\u00f3 del padre de sus 3 hijos de 15, 12 y 6 a\u00f1os.

They have nine children but only five live with them.  This large family lives in a home of their own in the Inchatingari community, within the Peren\u00e9 district of Chanchamayo.\r\n\r\n\r\nElvira is a woman who tries very hard and has been farming for more than 50 years.  She began helping her parents as a little girl, so she was easily able to learn these skills.  When she married, she had to increase her work, because the children would be coming.  With her husband\u2019s help, she raises coffee, lemons and oranges on the three plots of farmland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe oranges are well sought after and I sell each basket for 8 PEN,\u201d she tells us.  Keeping in mind that she gets 200 baskets out of each harvest, Elvira earns enough income to support her family.\r\n \r\n\r\nCoffee gives her the greatest satisfaction, but she also has to invest time and money.  She is happy with her work and for this reason will continue raising her crops until she sees her children grown and on their own.   \u201cThen I will only need to worry about planting to eat,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will be the third loan she gets from MFP and she is committed to being on time with her monthly payments.  She likes teamwork because of the unity among the members of the \u201cLos Productores inchatingari\u201d communal bank.  She will use the money from this loan to buy bags of natural fertilizer to renew her coffee crops, and to pay for field hands. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1010192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Comprar sacos de fertilizantes, plantas de caf\u00e9, contratar peones.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-03T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-02T21:30:03Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-05T19:55:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":394789,"name":"Laila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Laila is a 48-year-old housewife married to Mohammad, who works as a constructor.

In addition she is warm and friendly. She is married to Jos\u00e9, who is a business person, but who is currently not working because of an illness he suffers from. He is the father of her children, all of whom are now adults and independent. They live comfortably together in their son's house, along with their daughter-in-law, and a grandson whom they love dearly. \r\n\r\nRosa sells candy and soft drinks, and for this has a space set up in her son's house. She buys these products from the distributor, and sells them among her neighbors. She is well-known, because of the time she has been in that business. She got started little by little with a loan from MFP, buying in small quantities, and on seeing the reception this had, decided to continue, so far doing this on her own.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business quite profitable because of the earnings it provides, and she uses these to pay her expenses and to reinvest in working capital. Before starting her business, she had financial problems, as her elderly husband has health problems; and as his income is not regular, he needs financial support from his children. That is why she decided to start the business, in order to support their expenses.   \r\n\r\nShe hopes to increase her business's stock of products, and see it grow, in order to have greater earnings. This will be her fifth loan with the MFP institution. She is thankful to know that she will continue to have a line of credit so that she can keep her business going.

She plants potatoes, peas, and gladiola flowers. The work is intense, and as a result she contracts personnel to help with the labor. All the while, her husband works for his public transportation service with his own vehicle (car). Yolanda's objectives are very clear. She also dedicates herself to the business of the purchase and sale of potato seeds, and she likes this activity because she obtains helpful income that allows her to live comfortably and pay for an adequate education for her children in the city.

All her previous loans have been duly repaid.\r\n\r\nWith this current loan, she is planning to buy 15 boxes of tomato concentrate, 8 boxes of Maggi cubes, 5 bags of pepper grains, 4 bags of dried onions, 3 bags of laurel leaves and 8 boxes of mustard at the Grand Market in Sikasso.  She is planning to resell her merchandise for retail or wholesale, for cash or on credit, to customers who are consumers or retailers themselves. She will do so at the new market in M\u00e9dine where she is already reselling.\r\n\r\nWith her loan, Ramatou is expecting monthly profits to reach 120,000 CFA francs, which will be used to contribute to family expenses, pay off her loan's interest and invest the rest in her activity.  \r\n\r\nHer ambition is to become a wholesaler on the market where she currently works, in order to serve the retailers of that market who are often having a hard time accessing

She lives in her own home with her husband Fabian, who is 44, and her beloved children, 21-year-old Dina and 14-year-old Tabita, whom she loves and supports.\r\n\r\nSerafina is a woman of great worth who takes care of her family.  That's why she started her grocery store 20 years ago and, thanks to this business, today she is able to cover her household expenses.  The people who come to Serafina's stand know that they will find what they need because she always changes up her products without running out of anything.  This is how she's able to keep her regular customers happy.  Serafina is happy with her business, but it will be difficult for her when her store is empty and she has nothing to sell.  That's why she went to MFP's offices, to ask for a loan that she could qualify for based on her work methods.  This will be her fifth loan with MFP and she is proud of the confidence they have shown in her.  She promises to make her payments on time.  She is also an active and supportive member of her communal bank.  With the 1,000 nuevos soles, she will buy products to stock her store, such as different kinds of vegetables, bags of rice, sugar, noodles, canned food, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1011972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy different kinds of vegetables, bags of rice, sugar, noodles, and canned foods.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-03-04T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-03T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Serafina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":83.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":90.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":90.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":94.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":101.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":104.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":108.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":116.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.97},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.1},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-19T11:48:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":395299,"name":"Gayane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gayane is 42 years old.

Rosa is an entrepreneurial woman who has always enjoyed working in business since she was very young.  This helped her to cover her school expenses.  Rosa tells us that when she was in her third year of elementary school, her father made her a small wooden box which she filled with candies and then went out to sell them in every market in Pichari district so that she could cover some of her school expenses.  This is how she started off in business.  Rosa currently has a small 'recreational bar' where she sells drinks and traditional dishes prepared with regional produce and fine meats.\r\n\r\nRos is proud of what she does as it is profitable.  Her busiest days are weekends when her bar is full of customers.

Mercedes runs a convenience store from her house, where she also sells cold drinks.

She remembers how, when she started, she didn't have any knowledge of how to do this kind of work, but with time she learnt and now she is an expert salesperson and very cherished among her customers. She enjoys her job because she gets to be around people so she isn't alone when her husband and son go out to work, and also because it generates a good income thanks to her good levels of daily sales.\r\n\r\nThis will be Mercedes' eighth loan from MFP, which she hopes to use to carry out her plans.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

Cynthia is single and lives in her parents' home together with her two siblings Keyla and Vivi, who are 18 and 17 years old, as well as her mom and dad.  \r\n\r\nCynthia's business is selling groceries and she has a store in her parents' home where she serves her customers in a kind manner.

Cynthia started her business one year ago with a loan from MFP and, up to now, she has worked alone though her sisters sometimes help her to serve her customers.  She considers her business to be fairly profitable as she sells basic household products which always sell well.  This gives her constant capital turnover.  She did not have any problems before starting out in her business but she wanted to make her own income and support her parents with their household expenses.  Given the good results that she has experienced, she would like to continue working in her business and also start a new business selling clothing as she has seen that this is pretty profitable too.\r\n\r\nThis will be Cynthia's fourth loan from MFP.  She is happy to know that she will have the support she needs to make progress in her business.  She feels comfortable with her community bank because of the support and solidarity that exists between its members.  Cynthia will invest the 1,000 soles she has requested in buying groceries to stock her business so that she has a wide range of goods available for sale.
