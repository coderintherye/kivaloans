Le grand obstacle est  qu\u2019elle vend en monnaie nationale (franc congolais). Cependant cette monnaie congolaise n\u2019est pas stable, elle subit de plus \u00e0 plus l\u2019inflation, ce qui entraine de perte de change avec la devise (les dollars), comme tous les congolais craignent le franc congolais, pour garder leurs \u00e9conomies en dollars. En outre, ce travail de production boisson madrakwa est trop fatiguant \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle utilise encore la technologie rudimentaire, ainsi donc, elle souhaiterait changer le secteur d\u2019activit\u00e9 dans le futur. Elle souhaite voir  ses enfants finir les \u00e9tudes. Kabira K. a d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 plus de gain d\u2019impact visible avec  le cr\u00e9dit de Hekima, elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 construit une maison de 2 chambres et salon, qu\u2019elle met \u00e0 la disposition des locateurs pour accroitre ses revenus. La cliente Kabira K. remercie  Hekima pour  ses actions en faveur de pauvres citoyens exclus de banque classique.  Il sied de signaler que ce groupe Iragi est compos\u00e9 de 14 membres.\n\n\n\n","en":"Kabira K., the leader of the Iragi group, is 39 years old and married with seven children. Her husband is a driver. Her oldest son is 22 years old and the youngest is only 3; all, except the youngest, are in school. Since about ten years ago, she has been making a traditional local drink called \u201cMandrakwa\u201d for sale. She started with her own funds. Before launching into this business, she used to sell potatoes, charcoal etc. She sells out of her home. This loan will allow her to increase her working capital and purchase three bags of ingredients (corn, sorghum). \r\n\r\nHer big challenge is that her receipts are in local currency, the Congolese Franc. However, this is not a stable currency and the inflation is growing, which results in losses when Congolese Francs are exchanged into hard currency (US dollars). Like all locals, distrusting the Congolese currency, Kabira keeps her savings in US dollars. In addition, the production of \u201cMadrakwa\u201d is very labor-intensive, given that she is still using a very rudimentary technology, and thus she would like to change her type of business in the future. She would like to see her children finish their studies. \r\n\r\nThanks to the loans from Hekima, Kabira K. already has made visible progress: her earnings have allowed her to build a house with two bedrooms and a living room; she rents out the house to increase her income. Kabira Kalondera thanks Hekima for assisting impoverished citizens who do not have access to the traditional banking system. It should also be mentioned that the Iraqi group consists of 14 members. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva

She started selling fried foods during a period when her husband lost his job and she needed to cover the household expenses.\r\n\r\nIlsy has seen her micro-business grow little by little.  She has gradually added other food items such as cakes and now she wants to include fast food items such as hot dogs, sandwiches, chuzos (meat on a stick), grilled arepas (a type of flatbread).  The reason  for her kiva loan request, her sixth loan, is the desire to purchase a hot dog cart and supplies for her new products such as sausages, sauces, flour and also soft drinks.\r\n\r\nIlsy allocates her time well to each activity.  Every day she fries the arepas, empanadas and cariba\u00f1olas (yucca stuffed with meat) which are her breakfast options.  She makes the cakes on the weekends allowing the families to rest and not cook and soon she will diversify her offerings by adding fast foods which have a higher sales level on the weekend evenings from Friday to Sunday and on holidays.  Since Ilsy T. started as a client of the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, she has improved her income, her business has grown which has allowed her to improve the quality of education of her two children, 7 and 12 years of age.  Her goals are focused on further growing her business, especially having a space with a structure that befits her activity of making food.  She is very fortunate in terms of her location as she lives in the Las Nieves neighborhood, a community that maintains the happy profile of the people of Barranquillera which attracts customers during festivities and recreational events and strengthens her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Bobbit, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":736.55,"image":{"id":605446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of hot dog cart and raw materials for her new products such as sausages,sauces, flour and refreshments.

She gets the candy at wholesale prices and sells it at higher retail prices.  She has many dealers in neighborhood stores that know her from the times that she was a promoter.

They have a great desire to get ahead and live together in a densely populated neighbourhood in the north of the city. Every day starts very early for this hard-working woman. She gets up at dawn to get all of the breakfasts ready to serve to her devoted customers. After 5 am she goes to her stall, located at a bus stop near the highway north of the city. This is where the transportation workers go, anxious to start their work days with full stomachs. Her work ends at 10 am, when she has no more food to offer. She is very satisfied; from her sales, she makes a considerable income that allows her to offer her family a good quality of life. Even though she feels tired at times, she knows that the reward of her sacrifice is being able to offer the best to her little child. Since she is an enterprising woman, she plans to open a food sales store in a more stable commercial area in the future. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she promises to pay her quotas punctually. She wants to continue taking out more loans since she has many plans to see through. Loretta plans to invest the requested loan in the purchase of some pop to stock her business, and ingredients that she needs in order to continue preparing her breakfasts.

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de la confecci\u00f3n de mandiles; es que no es muy trabajoso, ni requiere realizar muchos trazos, pero si es muy rentable. Es por ello que en adelante piensa asegurar las puertas y ventanas de su casa; con rejas, para asegurar sus  maquinas de coser.

He lives in his parents' home and he most desires to improve his quality of life.  Thus, work is important and where possible he supports his mother and sisters. So, every day, he starts working very early in the morning making leather aprons or pinafores for kitchen use or various household uses. He learned this work from his father when he was a child, and since then his home has become his studio and his workplace. In one week he produces 200 to 300 aprons and sells them in the largest marked in the district, where he has many customers who recognize his work. He most enjoys making the aprons; since it is not very arduous work, nor does it require much designing, but it is very profitable. Thus, in the future he wants to secure the doors and windows of his house; with bars, to secure his sewing machines. This is his eleventh loan with MFP, and he promises to pay all of the quotas punctually, since this loan will be very useful in the progress of his business.  With this loan, he will invest in the purchase of another sewing machine, in order to work with thinner materials. He hopes that his sister will be able to specialize in this activity.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":605533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase another sewing machine, to make thinner stitches","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":149.36},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":156.09},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":162.05},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":170.4},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":176.97},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":185.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.01},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.53},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":101.38,"local_amount":270.34,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":283.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449968,"comment":null},{"amount":137.83,"local_amount":367.56,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":385.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588667,"comment":null},{"amount":66.37,"local_amount":176.97,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":185.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463262,"comment":null},{"amount":69.42,"local_amount":185.13,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":194.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327852,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-02T16:08:21Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":233606,"name":"Kayi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"kayi H. est une dame de 62 ans, elle est veuve et m\u00e8re de 5 enfants, l'activit\u00e9 qu'elle exerce pour subvenir aux charges de sa famille est le commerce de sacs de charbons de bois. elle a commenc\u00e9 ce commerce en 2001. elle s'approvisionne \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du pays ce qui lui permet de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'une plus grande marge b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire sur ces ventes. sa client\u00e8le se compose de toutes personnes. elle a constat\u00e9 une baisse de son stock de marchandises. elle souhaiterai par cons\u00e9quent  se r\u00e9approvisionner et sollicite donc de WAGES un cr\u00e9dit pour l'achat d'une vingtaine de sacs de charbons de bois.","en":"Ms Kayi H. is a 62 year old woman, a widow, and a mother of 5 children.

She lives in her own house with her husband and two children.  Her business is selling fish.  Very early in the morning every day and on weekends she and her husband sell ceviche (marinated fish).  They do quite well with the business.\r\n\r\nSince her son works at the municipal fish gathering center when he gets off work he buys fresh fish and takes it home where Teodora prepares this very typical Peruvian dish.  She has managed to win over many customers who prefer her due to the service she provides.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is chatting with her customers.  She has been in business for 15 years and considers the most painful thing to face as a mother is being unable to rehabilitate her son from a paralysis he has in half his body.  For this reason she hopes to soon finish building her house to offer him a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis is her 13th loan with MFP; she\u2019s aware that she has to repay punctually and is willing to do so; she is a very cheerful, responsible member of her communal bank.  \r\n\r\nShe wants the loan to buy building materials and supplies like: cement and fine sand because she wants to

She lives in her own house together with her husband, their daughter and their 3-year old granddaughter, Fernanda. Gloria sells prepared foods from her home. Soon after breakfast she starts preparing the dishes on the menu for the day. Her regular customers are the mechanics that work near her house. They all enjoy her cooking and the variety of the foods she serves every day. For the lunch hour her daughter helps her with the customers to keep up with the rush that visit her restaurant. By herself she would not be able to keep up. What she most likes about her work is that she always sells out. Even though it's hard work to shop for the ingredients to prepare her foods she knows that every job has its sacrifices.

This loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

It serves as a distraction and at the same time she is able to secure her own source of income.

He has not drawn any loans from them so far. He is seeking a loan of 200,000 F, which will be used to buy agricultural inputs and build two ponds.

From a very young age, just like a game, she learned everything about the optimal planting and production of the lands where she now grows mainly corn and potatoes. The sale of corn has proved to be very profitable and supports her family, as well as providing her daughters with an education, which was the most important thing for her. \r\n\r\nShe has always enjoyed farming because she loves the landscape in her area. Time has gone by but she still sows corn. She also raises pigs to sell them at local fairs and get some extra income on top of the one she gets from agriculture. She is a very enterprising woman and in future she plans to sow peas, because their price is high in the current marketplace. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP. She is very happy to have financial backing and she has always proved to be very responsible in her payments. She also enjoys being part of her loan group because all members are responsible and supportive. She would like to thank those managing her loan request as it will be very valuable in the development of her business. She will invest the loan in the purchase of fertilizers and manure, which will increase the amount of land available for sowing.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alba Sort , Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":605647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eucalda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326999,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-04T14:13:07Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":233635,"name":"Eloy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Eloy B. vive en la ciudad de Carapegu\u00e1, es casado, tiene 2 hijos, todos dependen de \u00e9l econ\u00f3micamente.

His wife tended to the store while he worked on buying animals to do farm work, which they would later sell for meat in the store. The whole family works together in the store now, as it is the most important and highly-trafficked store in the city.

L. is 63 years old, lives with her spouse, and has four children.  \r\n\r\nWhen she was 34, she began selling children's underwear to contribute to household expenses.  Slowly, with the help of her husband, who gave her money every month, she was able to build her dream.  \"Variedades Judith\" [Judith's Variety Store] was growing slowly until she came to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation ten years ago.  There, she has received four loans, which she has used with a lot of success.  For example, she has increased the capital in her business, sent her children to school, and turned the second floor of her house into an apartment, which also generates income, and often covers the cost of food.  \r\n\r\nToday, her children are working professionals, which she says is the result of the support they received, which added discipline in their work and in the investment.  Judith dreams of putting her store in the lower part of her house, and to continue increasing her working capital in order to organize a distribution system for other working women so that they can have a source of income as well. This loan would be her fourth, and she plans to stock up on a variety of clothing and costumes for holidays that are coming up: a feast for ones in love, a feast of the angels, Halloween, and especially for December, when everyone buys what she is selling.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Eileen Gessner, Kiva

S. is a 43-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: food vending and livestock sales.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 5000 PHP. Nenita is now borrowing 18000 PHP so that she can purchase raw materials for food vending. This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 16000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Nenita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and assure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

N. is a 53-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: fishing and a sari-sari (general store). She lives in Sitio To-ong, Brgy Vito, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing and sari-sari store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 13,000. Teresa is now borrowing PHP 25,000 so that she can purchase fishing materials and more inventory to sell in her general store. This will be her eleventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Teresa aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have a 5-year-old child who goes to primary school. Felix Ruben has worked as a teacher for more than 16 years. They live in a humble house, since teacher salaries in the country are very low. Thus, they do not have the economic resources to repair some imperfections in their home. For this reason, they are requesting a new loan to build a wall behind their home, with the aim of separating their yard from that of their neighbor, and also to protect the family from the crime that is threatening the population of the area.

They have been very responsible in making payments, and it is important for us to help them improve their conditions of life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":605910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"BUYING ZINC SHEETING TO PUT A NEW ROOF ON HER HOUSE","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.97,"local_amount":839.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":841.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330987,"comment":null},{"amount":36.94,"local_amount":795.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":797.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182466142,"comment":null},{"amount":36.98,"local_amount":796.41,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":798.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189098273,"comment":null},{"amount":37.14,"local_amount":799.96,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":801.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348841,"comment":null},{"amount":38.85,"local_amount":836.79,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":838.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766520,"comment":null},{"amount":37.35,"local_amount":804.38,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":806.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209562,"comment":null},{"amount":37.41,"local_amount":805.68,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:53Z","rounded_local_amount":807.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078368,"comment":null},{"amount":36.92,"local_amount":795.22,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":796.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211147430,"comment":null},{"amount":24.44,"local_amount":526.56,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":527.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216432967,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-04T03:28:22Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:25:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":233785,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John K.

Pest problems and diseases on his lands have caused a decrease in crop production, which is why he is requesting a loan to purchase agricultural supplies such as fertilizers, fungicides, insecticides and manure.

To make a living, Charmen owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling dried fish, bagoong and dry goods.

Wilma owns and operates a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of her income comes from providing general services to local community members.

Wilma is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which she will use to purchase tools for her business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Wilma from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With more fish to catch and sell, Annie believes that sales will increase, leading to higher revenue.  \r\n\r\nAs a dedicated member of Kiva partner ASHI, she ensured strong performance with regular attendance at group meetings and steady repayments.

Patrick of Burora Traders, 37 and the married father of six, was able to start up his coffee trade businesses alongside bananas sales.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tsuma's best season is the month of January when the school year begins and there is high demand for school uniforms.\r\n \r\nHe decided to join Yehu to access loans to boost his tailoring business.

V. is a single woman who lives in Brgy. Dakit, Bogo, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: dried fish sales and food vending businesses. Virgilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005, because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virgilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 6,000 helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 6,000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase more dried fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for her future security. \r\n\r\nVirgilia aims to build a new house and buy a motorcycle when she has enough savings. Virgilia V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Caradio-an, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: pig fattening and fishing businesses. Her husband, Jim, who is 60 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living , and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 30 and 36 years old. \r\n\r\nEva joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000, because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eva has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,500 PHP, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for her livestock business and for maintenance on her husband's fishing boat so that her family can continue to save up for future home repairs. \r\n\r\nEva P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

To that end, NWTF offers green energy products designed to save money for its clients. In a partnership with SunTransfer and Arc Finance, NWTF distributes solar-powered lanterns that also functions as a charging station for mobile phones. These families normally use kerosene lamps to light their homes. The solar lantern offers a free, environment-friendly renewable source of energy, that allows them to reduce their monthly fuel costs.   \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Manghanoy, La Castellana, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: rice farming, food vending (bananaque) and livestock businesses. Her husband, Fidel, who is 45 years old, works as a farm laborer to earn his living, and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 15 and 17 years old. \r\n\r\nHayde Rose joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003, because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 21 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Hayde Rose has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of  7,800 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 22nd cycle loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use to maintain her rice field and buy stock for her food vending business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and the expansion of her business. Hayde Rose B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

S. is a married woman who lives in Prk. 7, Brgy. Cabacungan, La Castellana, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, pig fattening and rice thresher businesses. Her husband, Diego, who is 56 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have four children between the ages of 20 and 34 years old. \r\n\r\nHelen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006, because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to buy stocks of merchandise for her general store, and also to buy feed for her pigs so that she can continue to save up for the education of her youngest child and save so that she can expand her business. Helen S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

J. is a widow  who lives in Lower Caticugan, Brgy. Caticugan, Siaton, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a food vending  business. Crisanta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999, because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Crisanta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 6,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to pay for more inventory for the business so that she can continue to save up for the future and improve her family's living conditions. Crisanta J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to buy more inventory for her business so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and be able to sustain her business with her own revolving capital.

Campclark, Isabela, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband, Rolando, who is 57 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have six children who are between the ages of 13 and 31 years old. \r\n\r\nLourdes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002, because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lourdes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000, which she intends to use to buy more merchandise for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Lourdes C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have four children between the ages of 11 and 16 years old. \r\n\r\nJuvy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005, because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Juvy  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,800, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to pay for more merchandise for her sari-sari (general) store business, so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and the education of her children. Juvy G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in her own home with her husband and her three children who she adores.  Nelly sells basic necessities from a store that is established in a designated space in her house.  When she first started her business, Nelly sold generic medicines but did not do very well because she had to compete with the large pharmacy chains.  Seeing the need to switch to another field, she began selling basic necessities and continues to do so today.  Nelly has been in business now for 20 years and has done very well.  She continues to possess a charismatic personality and the desire to serve her customers.  In addition, she is always mindful of keeping her store well-stocked.
