people say that life is sweet, but still never without bitter moments that one has to go through and overcome. Our CCT* community partner, Revelieta D. C. or Nene as friends call her, proves it to be so. At 30, Revelieta has reached college and is married to Eddie, an ice cream maker. Their sweet marriage brought to life one child, who is in elementary school. REvelieta's family resides in Caloocan City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nAt present, Revelieta focuses on running her sari-sari (variety) store. She aims to meet the daily needs of her neighborhood with soft drinks and grocery items such as shampoo, canned goods, seasonings, among others. She also sells products from Avon, a brand of beauty products. With this business, Revelieta earns an average of Php300 a day.\r\n\r\nRevelieta knows inside of her that the variety store would not be enough to meet the needs and wants of her family. To continue operation of her business, she would like to apply for Php11, 000 loan. She plans to use this money to add more items to her store. \r\n\r\nOne challenge Revelieta faces at present is the difficulty of updating people with the payment of their debts. All that she dreams of in life is to make her family happy and give them a house they could call their own. She gives her best to make sure her only child gets a good education until  college. Life is not all the time sweet, but with all the efforts she is doing for her family, she sees to it that she will emerge an overcomer bringing home a sweet success. \r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":648621,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To add

Her husband, Rolando H., who is 50 years old, works in the furniture business to earn his living.  He also helps in his wife's business activities.  Medarda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Medarda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 18,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 30,000 PHP, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  For her 11th  loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy lumber for her furniture business so that she could continue to save up for the future and for her children's education.  Medarda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the loan, he will buy iron to help him to make iron rods in larger quantities to fulfill his customers orders and earn good income. Nargis is hopeful that a loan investment will be a profitable one for her husband and bring positive changes to his business.\r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her fourth loan application.

is a taxi driver from Khan Younis city in Gaza Strip. Ibrahim bought a taxi car 5 years ago and has been using it since then. Ibrahim gave the owner of the car a down payment from his savings and started paying the rest of the cost on a monthly basis from his work returns.\r\n\r\nNow that Ibrahim has only one payment left, he came to FATEN and took a loan to pay it and fully own the car. The car is two families' source of income as Ibrahim and his son Muhammad (who appears in the picture here because Ibrahim is a conservative man and doesn't want to be in the picture) share use of the car.  The son is married and has his own family.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m

With this business, Leticia earns an average of Php 300 a day.\r\n\r\nLeticia knows inside her that the sari-sari store will not be enough to meet the needs and wants of her family. To help her continue operation of her variety store, she would like to apply for a Php 25,000 loan. She plans to use this money to add more items to her store and keep the small business in shape. In just a small period of time, she intends to turn her small sari-sari store into a real grocery store, with more items to meet the needs of people in her community.\r\n\r\nAll that Leticia dreams of in life is to make her family happy and give them a house they can call their own. She gives her best to make sure her youngest child gets a good education up through college. Life is not always sweet, but with all the efforts she is making for her family, she sees to it that she will emerge a winner, bringing home sweet success.

J., 53, lost her dear partner in life, but now lives for her one child, who is in college. Elsa and her child currently stay in Caloocan City, Philippines. With all heart and strength, Elsa strives to make sure she gives her child a good life.\r\n\r\nElsa manages a computer shop, which is up and growing a year after it was started. Elsa offers Internet access to people in her community, particularly to the young generation who use the Web for educational purposes as well as for entertainment. Adults also gain needed Internet access, thanks to Elsa's business, which earns PHP 400 on an average day.\r\n\r\nElsa plans to add one more computer to her store in order to accommodate more customers, so she would like to apply  to CCT* for a PHP 18000 loan. Her ultimate goal for her business is to increase the number of her computers and expand the business.\r\n\r\nAt present, Elsa battles the lack of sleep brought by having to supervise the computer shop from early morning to late at night.

As a matter of fact, she\u2019s also caring for the families of her children. She will help them as long as she can, especially financially.\r\n\r\nBefore, the family had no stable source of income, but when Celia became a member of the Kiva field partner, Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), they started their pig-raising business. She used the loan that she received to start this business. She also started her business of buying and selling mango fruit. She sells it by the kilo. In that way she can help her family because of the extra income. \r\n\r\nNow, she wants to use her third loan through ASHI to buy things that are needed to improve her two businesses. She will buy more inventories of mango fruits and another piglet to raise, along with its different feeds and vitamins.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her businesses will become stable enough to provide enough income for her extended family. Now, Celia helps support her grandson, who is living with her.  She wants him to finish his studies so that their standard of living will change.\r\n\r\nCelia is hoping that someday they can have enough money for her retirement, so she saves some of the extra income that comes from the businesses that she started. She is also saving for the education of her grandson until he completes college, because she wants to give him a better life.\r\n\r\n

She is a widow and has two children. In 1998, Damilya bought a cheap young calf, which she raised and sold for a higher price.  She used that money to purchase two other calves. That is how Damilya\u2019s business was started. She has been engaged in cattle reselling for 12 years and has added more cattle to her herd. Unlike some other borrowers, Damilya is educated with a degree in teaching. When the teaching profession was one of the most prestigious ones, Damilya could not wait until she would proudly do her job. Unluckily, nowadays Damilya\u2019s salary does not allow her and her family to live a comfortable life. She has to concurrently work at a local school and look after her cattle. She is lucky to have a son, who helps her, so that she can get some rest from a chaos of every day life. With this loan, Damilya would like to get seven more sheep for a future reselling.  Her dream is to see her daughter graduate from college and find a good job and to arrange a nice wedding ceremony for her son. \r\n\r\n\u201cA good teacher is like a candle - it consumes itself to light the way for others.\u201d  How come the most valued profession has become one of the lesser paid in Kyrgyzstan? The Kyrgyz government is not paying enough attention to an existing problem. According to statistics, teachers\u2019 salaries are so miserable that most of them have to leave to join private entrepreneurship, which leads to a lack of qualified faculty in schools. Schools have to hire unskilled interns and it leads to a fall in standard of education. \r\n \r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She has operated this business for the last 15 years and has since not only gained much experience but also built a stable operation. She usually sells beef out of her stall. Before her husband was employed at his current job, he used to help with her business by purchasing livestock from the countryside and slaughtering them to sell. Now she purchases her meats from wholesale traders. Tserenbaltav is an open-minded, generous and clever woman. She says, \u201cI am planning to buy a car for my family\u201d.

She\u2019s a resident of a small Southern town: Kadamjai. Since early childhood, Gulbar watched her parents raise cattle. They later realized that they had to pass on the family business to Gulbar. Gulbar\u2019s parents have been breeding cattle for years and distributing their product to many local buyers. The business was started with only 500 soms, and eighteen years ago Gulbar took charge of it. Small investments brought some profit. At the moment she has two dairy cows and two young calves. She keeps herself busy every day. \r\n\r\nGulbar is married; her husband is an expert in a local firm. He also tries to help Gulbar with business. They thank their lucky stars for succeeding in this business because it helped them to provide a good education for their children. Their oldest son works in the US; their second son makes a living in Turkey. Unfortunately, the youngest son has physical disabilities and stays at home with his parents. \r\n\r\nEighteen years of cattle breeding generated proceeds to arrange a nice wedding ceremony for their daughter. Now they are working on the construction of their own filling station. Cattle breeding brings only 3000 soms a month, which is not enough for purchasing the required construction materials. The family hopes to get this loan to finish construction of the gas station. Traffic is always busy in their town, so they are sure that the filling station will always be full of customers and that they will be able to repay the loan. \r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? --- \r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is married and has seven children. Six of her older children live separately on their own. Her youngest son is 17 years old and helps out his parents in a long-standing family business. In a rural area, there is not much choice of what kind of business to start; it is either farming or livestock breeding.  Fifteen years ago this family decided to start horned cattle breeding. The main challenge was to take proper care of cattle and sell it for a price that would cover all costs.  Unfortunately, Ilimkan could not afford to give a high-quality education to her older children, which she deeply regrets, because now her children have to live abroad or work hard in order to make a living. She believes in the talents of her youngest son and hopes to do her best to provide a high-quality education for him. Ilimkan earns 2,000 soms every month, but it is not enough for constantly developing her business. She plans to use this loan to purchase additional two sheep for breeding. Ilimkan\u2019s husband is a manager of a household in a local ministry, and she is sure that the proceeds from her business and her husband\u2019s salary will be enough to gradually repay the loan. \r\n\r\nIlimkan is very thankful for project Kiva for bringing changes in her life and promises to do her best to repay the loan successfully. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She is a resident of Kadamjai, a small town in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan. Just like most of the  residents, Kanygul raises cattle. For many years, Kanygul raised cattle just for family purposes but her husband advised her to try starting a business in this sphere. Now, she has two heads of cattle and runs a slow business. Her husband is a cab driver, her oldest son is in Russia to earn a good income, her second son is in the army, her daughters live separately and her youngest son helps to take care of the cattle. Twenty years ago, the business was started from only 2,000 soms and since then, the family has managed to make major repairs to the house and arrange wedding ceremonies for their daughters. Now, Kanygul would like to start a dairy business and she has applied for this loan in order to do so. She hopes to get a loan and to use the proceeds to purchase a car for her son so that he can work as a cab driver. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

C. is from the village of Pinamulaan, Banisilan, South Cotabato. She is 31 years old. Arlene is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Arlene owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods, junk foods, and detergents in the local community. She is also engaging in buying and selling ready to wear clothing. Arlene has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Arlene joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arlene has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Arlene is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Arlene from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

T., 51, is making sure that her family has enough for their daily needs. Married to Ramon T., a butcher, they find comfort in their children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn enough for their three children who still live with them, so that they can have a better life. She has been managing her variety store while operating a food vending business as well.\r\n\r\nZenaida has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship* meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her businesses. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her businesses, she would like to apply for a PHP40,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying groceries, toiletries and beverages for her variety store. She will also use some of the loan to purchase more raw ingredients for her food vending business.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can leave a successful business as a legacy to them.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":648725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

Instead of allowing herself to get stuck in the middle of insecurities, in 2008, she joined KIVA field partner in the Philippines, ASHI, to be able to access a loan which will enable her productive self to flourish.\r\n\r\nThrough previous loans she\u2019s availed, she utilized them in her fishing business. The profits she will be getting will augment her husband\u2019s income, who is a fisherman and fish vendor, and as soon as it grows, she will be able to support her children\u2019s education until they are finished college and provide other needs in order to enjoy the gifts of life. By then, her role of mother will be fulfilled. \r\n\r\nHer membership in ASHI and the loans she has had since she became a member assisted her in operating her fishing business. Because of this, Wilma has performed very well in her credit rating (basis of loans), thus making her qualified for a higher amount of loan.\r\n\r\nWilma is very glad to be a Kiva borrower and says

Fareeda has two daughters and two sons, and the sons are already working and responsible for their families. The two daughters, Mai and Asma, are college students.\r\n\r\nFareeda's husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee. A couple of years ago he started a small grocery store to increase the family's income and to be able to cover his daughters' education expenses.\r\n\r\nFareeda came to FATEN and took a loan because her husband wants to enlarge the store and sell a larger variety of products in order to attract more clients and increase his income.\r\n\r\nFareeda's son Salama appear in the picture here as she is a conservative woman like most inhabitants of Gaza.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She is 34 years old. Vienna May is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Vienna May owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods, and junk food, in the local community.

He presents many choices and designs from furniture catalogs. His story illustrates the day-to-day challenges many people are facing in trying to take care of household expenses, sick and aging family members, and at the same time run a business. He is requesting a loan of $1,000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase a new pusher machine. This new machine will allow him to increase his manufacturing and deliver his products faster. In the future, he is looking to further expand his merchandise and invest in a new wood-sanding machine.

U. is 29 years old, married, and has one child. Married to Angelo U., a fish vendor, she makes sure that she helps her husband earn enough for them to have a better life. She has been managing her fish vending business for many years.\r\n\r\nMylene has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT)* for over a year. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow a number of times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her business.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to apply for a 10,000 PHP loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying more fish to sell in the market.

M., 41, breeds cows and calves in the small village of Sabirabad.

With their previous SMT\/Kiva lenders loans, some of these teachers started small businesses. Some invested their loans in an already existing business. Some bought pieces of furniture, some bought house-building materials, some paid school fees for their children, and so on and so forth. With the help of this new loan, they will be able to once again do or invest in something bigger than their mere salaries alone will allow.\r\n\r\nSantigie A.

Bhoke is a primary school teacher, but on the side she runs a small clothing shop in order to make ends meet. Bhoke started her clothing shop two years ago. The shop is open between 9:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. and earns Bhoke a low monthly profit. \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Bhoke's fourth loan with Tujijenge Tanzania. Bhoke used her previous loans to increase her stock in clothes and to add some variety and new products to her shop. All these loans have since been successfully repaid.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the culturA. context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principA. loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

This group is from J.A. Saldivar.  Many years of hard work have allowed them to grow socially as well as economically and they are known in the area as very hard-working women.  They had a challenging time with their last loan since two of their partners did not make their weekly payments.  They canceled the loan and assumed the responsibility of successfully reforming their group.  \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Laura has been the leader in restarting this group.  She is a very entrepreneurial and capable woman.  To support her family, she works selling fruits and vegetables from her own stand.  It is a good business for her and every day she sells a lot.

They have 6 children, but only live with one of them, who they care for and educate in their home, located in San Pedro D. Cajas. In the town of San Pedro, most people specialize in arts and crafts. Very few people, like Luzmila, are successful in other fields. She says that 35 years ago she opened a bakery and since then everything has been going well. Most people buy their bread and pastries from her business and she sells more each day. But as a true blooded resident of San Pedro, she loves art and also weaves and does embroidery. Her 20 years of experience is reflected in her craft shop in the town's central park. But what she wishes most is to open her bakery in other locations. This is her fourth loan with MFP and she is proud of the success in the community bank, where it's members are responsible and committed. This loan will help her buy wholesale crafts for this holiday season and if the money will buy enough wool she will design carpets and tapestries, requested by her clients.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":649062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Buy handicrafts and wool to make rugs.

Esta localidad es vecina de la capital Barranquilla en la costa norte de Colombia. La microempresaria despu\u00e9s de terminar sus estudios de secundaria empez\u00f3 a laborar como vendedora en varios almacenes de ropa. A ra\u00edz de un recorte de personal fue despedida y fue entonces cuando le propuso a su madre, que es una veterana modista, asociarse para producir ropa casual femenina como: multiusos, pantalones de licra y blusas. Actualmente, el peque\u00f1o taller de Mitxy y su madre cuenta con una m\u00e1quina de coser familiar y una fileteadora. Los pedidos han aumentado tanto que est\u00e1n pensando en comprar otra m\u00e1quina y contratar una operaria. La joven Mitxy se encarga de comercializar la mercanc\u00eda en locales comerciales del centro de Soledad. Algunos de los almacenes en los cuales ella trabaj\u00f3 son ahora sus clientes. Este es el tercer pr\u00e9stamo al que aplica con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y su primer Credikiva. Siempre se ha distinguido por su puntualidad y planea invertirlo en la compra de telas, hilos, encajes y accesorios. El volumen de ventas mensuales es de $ 2.000.000 y el margen de utilidad es aproximadamente del 40%. En la temporada de fin de a\u00f1o las ventas se incrementan considerablemente.\nMitxy sue\u00f1a con abrir un establecimiento al p\u00fablico en el cual pueda ofrecer todos sus productos. Considera que no le teme a la competencia porque no es f\u00e1cil ofrecer prendas de buena calidad a precios bajos como ella lo hace. \n","en":"Mitxy Esther A. Berm\u00fadez is an enterprising young woman who lives with her mother, her husband, and her small, one year old child in the municipality of Soledad.  This location is next to the capital, Barranquilla, which is on the northern coast of Colombia.\r\n\r\nThis small businesswoman decided after finishing high school to start working as a salesperson in various clothing stores.  Due to a cut in personal, she was let go.  That is when she proposed to her mother, a veteran seamstress, that they team up to make casual women\u2019s clothing like multiuse garments, lycra pants, and blouses.\r\n\r\nCurrently Mitxy and her mother\u2019s small shop has a sewing machine and an overlocking machine.  Orders have increased so much that she is thinking of buying another machine and hiring a worker.  Mitxy is in charge of selling the merchandise in commercial areas in the center of Soledad.  Some of the stores where she worked are now her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is the third loan she has requested from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and it is her first Kiva loan.  She has always been characterized by her punctuality.  She plans to use the loan to buy fabric, thread, lace, and accessories.  Her monthly sales volume is $2,000.

She is a seamstress and lives with her partner.  She has two children, thirty-three, and thirty-four. She started her business thirty years ago, sewing her own uniforms.  She got experience sewing for her family because she saw how her neighbor did it.  Later, when she went to work in a sewing factory she perfected her art, which until then had been only the product of her potential as an artisan.  That was how she started her business in the town of Santo Tom\u00e1s, where she lived.  Then, when she moved to Barranquilla, she picked up with her work again and started to market her own services to the point that she grew her clientele, who now comprise not only people from her area, but also from her native San Tom\u00e1s.\r\n\r\nThrough her business, Esramina has succeeded in getting her family ahead and making significant income for the household.  This will be her sixth loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She was able to use prior loan to increase her working capital, because she didn't have much.  Now she feels better able to buy in cash and respond to her clients in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\nWith her Kiva loan, Esramina will stock up on fabrics, ornaments, and thread to show her clients so they can choose the fabrics they want for the new clothes they will sport on special days:  December 7th, the Day of the Immaculate Conception, when everybody gets up early to line their properties with candles and lamps; December 24th, celebrating the birth of the baby Jesus; and December 31st, the last day of the year, marked by big send-offs, with fiestas where everyone exchanges hugs and welcomes the new year with their neighbors and families with whistles, noisemakers, music, and smiles.\r\n\r\nEsramina's dream is to keep growing so she can increase her family's income and always be able to help all of her children and her family in general.  Her biggest challenge is the excess of work she has for all the clientele that are happy with her garments and seek her out.  In seasons like December she doesn't have enough time to respond to everyone and retain them throughout the year. But when the season finally does come, she has helpers that also earn a bit of extra money, so she can get it done with their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":529.63,"image":{"id":645004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To

Her daily work covers her main necessities, especially for her small children, and in the short term will allow her to install a grocery store in her house so she can dedicate more time to her children. It is for this reason Marisabel is seeking a loan to purchase stock and merchandise to implement her business and generate better earnings which will permit her to save and arrive at her goal. \n\n** Mr. Simeon V.

He is 31 years old and lives in his parents' home in San Pablo neighborhood.  He is the oldest of three siblings.\r\n\r\nFabio tells us that he has worked for a long time for other companies who make garments and embroideries.  However, over time and bearing in mind the knowledge which he had acquired as regards the production process, working machines and serving customers, Fabio decided to set up his own small business.  Helped by family members who provided him with space in their homes, he was able to set up an office and a workshop.  He acquired his first machine for making embroideries which was originally enough to cover the first jobs that he carried out in his own business.\r\n\r\nHowever, for some years he couldn't manage with the orders which he had and so, through a lot of hard work, he acquired a new, more sophisticated machine which was able to produce 10 embroidery designs in 10 minutes.  In this way he is currently able to satisfy his customers who work for a number of well-known companies.\r\n\r\nFabio loves creating his own embroidery designs since it allows him to offer a range of suggestions to all his customers.\r\n\r\nHe says \u201cHaving a loan is always good because it allows me to acquire different raw materials which I need to fill my orders on time and thereby provide

honor a la localidad donde habitan sus integrantes, la cruz del itacuan se ubica a 15 minutos de Pinotepa, y la mayor\u00eda de sus habitantes hablan la lengua mixteca, tambi\u00e9n se dedican al trabajo en el campo, a la cr\u00eda de cabras (chivos). su representante se llama: Francisca S\u00e1nchez Gonz\u00e1lez, todas las integrantes del grupo dedican su tiempo al empleo personal y a la venta de algunos productos de consumo regional. \nHaremos un espacio para hablar  un poco de la vida de una miembro de este grupo ella es la se\u00f1ora Francisca S\u00e1nchez Gonz\u00e1lez, quien tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, ella es la representante del grupo esta casada con Aron de 40 a\u00f1os, quien es chofer de un taxi del transporte publico, tiene 4 hijos, ellos son: Mirna de 18, Natali de 11, Rafael de 9 y Dalila de 8 a\u00f1os de edad, todos ellos est\u00e1n estudiando actualmente.\nFrancisca, se dedica a la venta de carne de puerco desde hace mas de 6 a\u00f1os, a ella le gusta su trabajo, a pesar de que apara algunos no sea nada agradable el sacrificar animales, esta es una forma de aportar al gasto familiar y escolar de sus hijos, ella tiene su propio criadero de puercos, que adquiere desde peque\u00f1os y se encarga de cuidarlos y alimentarlos hasta que llegan a ser adultos para su venta, ya sea en peso bruto o destazado, esta actividad es poco usual en su comunidad pero se vio en la necesidad de incursionar en esta \u00e1rea, con esta actividad ella puede fomentar el autoconsumo interno de la producci\u00f3n y cr\u00eda de puercos en la comunidad. Su esposo se dice muy orgulloso de ella y el le ayuda a la cortar la carne y a la elaboraci\u00f3n de chicharr\u00f3n de puerco, para los que no saben que es el chicharr\u00f3n, es la piel del cerdo mejor conocida como cuero, esta se cocina en grasa hirviendo, hasta llegar al punto de dorarse, es una comida tradicional del pueblo mexicano.\nFrancisca integro un grupo de cr\u00e9dito, primeramente por su necesidad de un pr\u00e9stamo y la necesidad de sus dem\u00e1s compa\u00f1eras. Ella utilizo este recurso  para la compra de puercos, el mantenimiento e su corral y para el alimento de los puercos que ella misma esta criando, pudo adquirir mas le\u00f1a para cocinar el chicharr\u00f3n, chiles para elaborar chorizo y carne enchilada. \nUno de sus grandes sue\u00f1os de Francisca es tener una granja grande de puercos, aumentar sus numero de animales, y as\u00ed ella podr\u00e1 dar trabajo a ka gente que habita en esta poblaci\u00f3n para que se desarrollen y puedan progresar ya que los recursos del gobierno est\u00e1n mal invertidos, ella quiere promover la crianza de animales para autoconsumo dentro de la zona, pero para esto se necesita de mas inversi\u00f3n de apoyo por parte de todos y el esfuerzo y compromiso de mas gente que quiera salir adelante, tambi\u00e9n aspira a tener su propio local comercial para la venta de carne y as\u00ed como el equipo necesario para facilitar mas su trabajo. Tambi\u00e9n quiere que sus hijos se preparen de manera profesional, que se ganen la vida en oportunidades mejores, y que ellos puedan lograr sus sue\u00f1os de ellos y de los que los rodean.\nTodas las personas que integran este grupo son mujeres muy trabajadoras, llenas de \u00e1nimo, son muy alegres y a pesar de la situaci\u00f3n en que viven algunas, creen en la realizaci\u00f3n los sue\u00f1os y  en la bondad de las dem\u00e1s personas que sirven a los dem\u00e1s, ellas son muy cumplidas con sus compromisos, con sus familias y con su gente, esta es una caracter\u00edstica de los ind\u00edgenas que habitan esta zona de Oaxaca. \nFrancisca, esta totalmente agradecida con la nobleza de los que apoyan a los diferentes grupos en el mundo, haciendo as\u00ed posible los sue\u00f1os de muchos y mejorando la forma de vivir de los m\u00e1s necesitados.

The group gave itself this name in honour of the locality where the members live. La Cruz de Itacuan is located 15 minutes from Pinotepa and the majority of its inhabitants speak the Mixteca language and work in the countryside raising goats. Their representative is named Francisca S\u00e1nchez Gonz\u00e1lez, all the members of the group dedicate their time to personal work and the sale of some regionally consumed products. \r\n\r\nWe will make space to talk a little about the life of one member of this group. Mrs. Francisca S\u00e1nchez Gonz\u00e1lez, who is 39 years old, is the representative of the group and is married to Aron, 40 years old, who is a public transport taxi driver. She has 4 children: Mirna, 18; Natali, 11; Rafael 9; and Dalila, 8 years old. They are all currently studying. \r\n\r\nFrancisca has sold pork for more than 6 years. She likes her work, even though for some there is nothing pleasant in sacrificing animals, this is a way to contribute to the family expenses and school expenses of her children. She has her own pig farm, which she aquires when they are young and looks after them and feeds them until they are adults to be sold, either by gross weight or cut up. This activity is not very common in her community but she saw the need to enter into this area. With this activity she can boost the internal personal consumption of the production and raising of pigs within the community. Her husband is very proud of her and he helps her to cut the meat and with the production of pork chicharr\u00f3n. For those who don't know what chicharr\u00f3n is, it's the skin of the pig, which is cooked in boiling fat until becoming golden. It's a traditional food of the Mexican people.     \r\n\r\nFrancisca formed a loan group primarily for her need of a loan and the need of her fellow group members. She used this resource for the purchase of pigs, the maintenance of their pen and to feed the pigs which she herself is raising. She was able to acquire more firewood to cook chicharr\u00f3n, chili peppers to make chorizo and meat seasoned with chili. One of Francisca's biggest dreams is to have a big pig farm, to increase the number of animals, and by this way she will be able to give work to the people who live in this town so that they develop and are able to progress, since government resources are poorly invested. She wants to promote the raising of animals for personal consumption within the zone, but for this it's necessary to have more support investment from everyone and the effort and commitment of more people who want to get ahead. She also aspires to have her own commercial premises for the sale of meat as well as the necessary equipment to further facilitate her work. She also wants her children to prepare themselves professionally, to earn a living with better opportunities, and for them to be able to achieve their dreams and those of those who surround them.    \r\n\r\nAll the people who make up this group are very hard-working women, full of motivation. They are very happy, and despite the situation in which some of them live, they believe in the fulfillment of their dreams and in the goodness of other people who serve others. They are very fulfilled with their commitments, with their families and with their people. This is a characteristic of the indigenous people who live in this part of Oaxaca.  \r\n\r\nFrancisca is extremely thankful for the nobility of those who support different groups throughout the world, in this way making possible the dreams of many and improving the lives of those most needy. On behalf of the members of this group, she sends fraternal greetings to whoever sees this story as well as a big hug to those who support her project.\r\n\r\nBelow are given the names of the members of the \"Itacuan\" group as well as their production activities: \r\n\r\nHeriberta Rafaela R.

However, lately he has been directing his focus more towards copper since it provides 70% profits.  For this reason, he will use his Kiva loan to buy this metal which he will sell to companies who transform it to make pipes, bars, decorations and ultimately sell it to China.\r\n\r\nWilfrido buys retail from individual recyclers who collect the material and bring it to him.
