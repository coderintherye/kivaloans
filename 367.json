It is located in Jojutla de Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s Pedro Amaro neighborhood in the state of Morelos.  There are 11 members in the group.\r\n\r\nAmada L\u00f3pez Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, known as Amadita, is the group president.  She is 58 years old, married, completed elementary school, and has been a baker for the last 5 years.  She has 5 children: one girl and four boys.  She also has a grandson that she is raising; he is the only one still dependent on her economically.  The idea to install a bakery arose when Fernando, her oldest son, who was employed in a bakery, had three accidents on the way to work.  She decided it would be best to set up her own bakery taking advantage of Fernando\u2019s experience and skills.\r\n\r\nAmadita had been a housewife up to this point so starting out in this business wasn\u2019t easy.  However, the trust she placed in her son had the desired success.  They started off with a small oven, using their dinner table and baking sheets improvised from oil cans; they purchased all their ingredients with Fernando\u2019s severance pay and savings they had.\r\n\r\nAmadita\u2019s commercial activities have been life changing for her and her family; she has both her son and husband employed by her firm.  Her goal is that it grows into a large, commercial bakery.\r\n\r\nShe will use the funds to buy a new slicer.  This will be a first step toward equipping her small bakery to become a large, commercial baking company.\r\n\r\nAna Lilia M. V., 37, is group treasurer.  She finished secondary school, lives with her life partner, and has 5 children.  She has sold groceries for the last 12 years.\r\n\r\nLeticia M. V., 28, is another group member.

For seven years she has been selling food that she prepares in her house.  She gets fresh ingredients in the mornings, and after cooking she leaves to sell her food in the afternoon.  Her customers are the merchants in the area where she lives.\r\n\r\nHer business of selling food is very profitable because she is paid in cash and she gets daily earnings.  Also, on the week ends she makes different dishes that are typical of her region.  She sells them in the tent that is set up at the door to her house.  In the future she plans to set up a place or a small cafe in a school in order to make greater quantities of food.\r\n\r\nThis is her 17th loan with MFP.  She is very grateful to all of the people who make it possible for her to get a loan that will allow her to continue progressing.  Gloria will use the money she is requesting to buy wholesale ingredients like sacks of quinoa, sugar, and disposable glasses.  She will do this to be well stocked and to keep working without problems.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

It is a united and dynamic group  as is demonstrated by their president who is married and has two small children, one of school age and the other a one year old baby. Norma sells food from the doorway of her house where she attends to some boarders and the local people. The loan will be used to buy tables and sunshades so she can serve her clients on her patio and she would like a cabin to make her customers more comfortable when it rains. She wants to grow her business so that she can finish building her house and put a better roof over the heads of her children. Her husband works as a chauffeur and helps his wife and hopes to have his own car so that he can work and improve his family's quality of life. The other members of the group sell sodas, coffee, cosmetics, clothes, and  sweaters, another serves customers in a beauty salon, and the one male in the group has his own locksmith business. There is plenty of competition in the markets within which they operate, but they rely on the speed with which they can change and supply their goods to be successful and get the income they need to support their families. The current loan will be used for operating capital and to buy supplies, raw materials, and goods to increase their sales and improve their families' quality of life. In speaking of their experiences, it can be said that the members used to work with other similar micro-loan institutions through the Foundation so they know how to administer the funds granted for the benefit of their businesses and for the improvement of the quality of life in their homes. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":504898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Operating capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-03-13T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma Emiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionicia Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguelina Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery Charo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zandra Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":14500,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1740.76},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1760.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1781.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1801.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1822.28},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1843.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1864.46},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1885.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.97},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.81},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.81},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":500.99,"local_amount":3500.88,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3506.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945065,"comment":null},{"amount":773.55,"local_amount":5405.55,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5414.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673406,"comment":null},{"amount":263.78,"local_amount":1843.25,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1846.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707454,"comment":null},{"amount":266.81,"local_amount":1864.46,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1867.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707455,"comment":null},{"amount":269.87,"local_amount":1885.86,"processed_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1888.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151890973,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-15T16:15:50Z","paid_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":184115,"name":"Bc Abejitas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cBc Abejitas\u201d esta representado por la se\u00f1ora Simona y compuesto por 11 miembros compuesta D. 10 mujeres y un var\u00f3n.

The group is comprised of 12 very active and dynamic members.  Elsa Miriam is a member who demonstrates this.  She works selling \u201cchoripanes\u201d (barbecued sausage stuffed in bread) and sandwiches in the old station in the city of El Alto.  \r\n\r\nShe is married and has two children.  Her husband is a bricklayer, and he helps her with some of the household expenses.  Because this is not enough, she needs to work for her children\u2019s food and education.  Her children are school-age.  That is how they got the name of the group.  The family makes any small business big.  Elsa Miriam\u2019s greatest hope is that her children become professionals and to see them develop enough so that they have a better future.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the members sell wholesale CDs, beer, clothes, and plastics.  Some provide plumbing and transportation services.  There is plenty of competition in the market, but they get ahead by quickly changing and stocking their merchandise.  That way they get the necessary income to support their families.\r\n\r\nThe current loan will be used as operating capital to get merchandise, supplies, and materials to increase their sales and improve their families\u2019 quality of life.  The group is currently in their fourth cycle.  They always demonstrate competence, responsibility, and commitment to their group.  Many of the small business have grown.  For example, Elsa Miriam now has her cart for selling choripanes.  She can give her customers better service.  Now she wants to start selling another type of food.  That is the reason she needs the loan. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Elisabeth G. lives in the center of Turi Parish.

She is 40 years old and separated from her spouse seven years ago due to a lack of understanding in their home.  This relationship resulted in four children (ages 17, 14, 8, and 6).  They are all students attending primary and secondary school respectively.  She does not have her own home and lives in a rental property.\r\n<p> \r\nThis is her second loan cycle and her previous loan helped with the household expenses.  She dedicates herself to her household chores and also raises cows, chickens, and sheep to sell from home or at the livestock fair.

Sometimes they are reserved for personal consumption.  This is her eighth loan cycle with this group of determined women.  These loans have helped her move her family forward.

The majority sell food or pastries; some are taxi drivers, mechanics and do auto body work.  The competition in these businesses is stiff, but the members can rely on long experience in their work.  This loan is for working capital, which the members will invest in merchandise or tools for their shops or ingredients for their food stands; in this way, they will make more money for household expenses.  The bank has substantial experience with this group:  this is not the first time they have applied for a loan from our institution.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva

sector Posope Alto del distrito de Patapo, una zona conocida por ser netamente productora de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar y que se encuentra ubicado a treinta minutos de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nDesde hace dos a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de ropa y cosm\u00e9ticos. Debido a que la mayor\u00eda de pobladores de la zona son trabajadores dependientes de la empresa agroindustrial del lugar, su negocio de venta de ropa la realiza principalmente al cr\u00e9dito para ser cobrado quincenalmente (en algunos casos mensualmente). En el caso de la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos, \u00e9sta se hace a trav\u00e9s de cat\u00e1logos y directamente de su stock de mercader\u00eda.\n\nSu negocio es de mucha ayuda para la econom\u00eda de su hogar, su esposo trabaja como chofer de combi de la ruta P\u00e1tapo \u2013 Chiclayo. Con el dinero que ambos perciben, salen adelante y actualmente se encuentran ahorrando dinero para poder adquirir su casa propia.\n\nMirtha desea ampliar su negocio con la compra de mas productos, por ello se encuentra solicitando por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 2000 nuevos soles.\n\nElla es una mujer bastante trabajadora y muy entregada a su familia. Sus vecinos y conocidos le tienen mucha estima y le consideran una persona de confianza.\n","en":"Mirtha is a 31 year old mother who lives with her husband and young son in the home of her parents, which is located in the area of Posope Alto in the District of Patapo.  This region is located 30 minutes away from the city of Chiclayo and distinctly known for its sugar cane production.  \r\n<p>\r\nMirtha has been selling clothing and cosmetics for two years.  Since most of the local residents are workers who are dependent on the agro-industrial businesses in the area, her clothing sales are made on credit and she collects payments biweekly (and sometimes monthly).  With her cosmetics sales, her customers order through catalogs or buy directly from her stock of merchandise.\r\n<p>\r\nHer business has been a great help to her household finances.  Her husband works as a driver of a van that travels along the route between P\u00e1tapo and Chiclayo.  With the money they both earn, Mirtha and her husband are able to get ahead and are now saving money so that they can acquire their own home.\r\n<p>\r\nMirtha wants to expand her business by purchasing more products.  Therefore, she is requesting her first loan from Edpyme Alternative in the amount of 2000 PEN.  She is a hardworking woman who is dedicated to her family.  Her neighbors and acquaintances have great respect for her and consider her to be a trustworthy person.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":505015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase cosmetics & clothing to expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"P\u00f3sope Alto - P\u00e1tapo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-14T02:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirtha Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":142.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":149.27},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":157.53},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":162.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":167.01},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":175.79},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":180.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":185.04},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":192.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":197.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.28},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.86},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.01},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.54},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.42},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.08},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.69},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":49.28,"local_amount":135.94,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":139.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662300,"comment":null},{"amount":51.71,"local_amount":142.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":146.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695004,"comment":null},{"amount":54.11,"local_amount":149.27,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":153.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878049,"comment":null},{"amount":55.86,"local_amount":154.09,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":158.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618077,"comment":null},{"amount":57.1,"local_amount":157.53,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:08Z","rounded_local_amount":162.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832480,"comment":null},{"amount":59.01,"local_amount":162.78,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":167.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099088,"comment":null},{"amount":60.54,"local_amount":167.01,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":171.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554533,"comment":null},{"amount":337.39,"local_amount":930.73,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":958.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529978,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-08T07:51:49Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:45:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":184178,"name":"Andres Arnaldo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl Sr. Andres Arnaldo S.

A. is a 48-year-old married mother of three children.

She joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.) to acquire secured capital to continue expanding her business. For her, the business is important, and she does not want to be a problem for her group mates or for the center. \n\nJosephine applied for this loan of 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) to buy more inventory of peanut butter and ingredients. She also wants to save money from her business to meet their daily needs. She hopes that through her loans from ASHI in partnership with Kiva, someday she will be able to discover her talent and engage in a more productive business.\n\nJosephine dreams that her children will finish college. Additionally, she hopes to continue her business as a sustainable livelihood to support her family and provide them with a better life that is far away from poverty.\n\nNOTE: Please disregard the date appearing on the photo.

O. tiene 53 a\u00f1os y vive en el barrio Carrizal de Barranquilla, descrito por Aid\u00e9 como un barrio muy alegre donde en cada esquina, es escuchada la m\u00fasica con ritmos champetas a trav\u00e9s de enormes y resonantes  cajas de maderas llamados pickup, que al ser escuchadas en esta zona,   hace que ni\u00f1os y adultos se muevan al son de la m\u00fasica.  \nAid\u00e9 vive con su esposo y tiene 9 hijos entre los 25 y 39 a\u00f1os;  se dedica a la venta de almuerzos y algunas veces vende mercanc\u00eda,  negocio  en el que  quiere incursionar  gradualmente, cambiando poco a poco  su actividad de vender almuerzos y es justamente su gran desaf\u00edo; esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual est\u00e1 aplicando a un cr\u00e9dito por valor de $1.000.000 para comprar sabanas toallas, vestidos  para ni\u00f1os  ropa y calzado.\nInici\u00f3 su negocio con la ayuda de un amigo que ten\u00eda la experiencia de comprar mercanc\u00eda en el  departamento de la Guajira   con muy  buena acogida de sus clientes, pero luego  Aid\u00e9  realiz\u00f3 sus propios viajes, comprando electrodom\u00e9sticos, ropas, toallas, con buenos resultados.  Ella a\u00fan recuerda, cuando lleg\u00f3 de 9 a\u00f1os a Barranquilla desde Arenal, en el departamento de  Bol\u00edvar   y no pudo  terminar sus estudios de bachiller por muchas dificultades, por eso se dedic\u00f3 a la venta de mercanc\u00edas  y posteriormente a la venta de almuerzos  entre los vecinos de su barrio  y de     sectores aleda\u00f1os a su negocio. En la actualidad los hijos la apoyan, este es precisamente uno de sus logros: el  haberlos sacado adelante, porque han realizado carreras t\u00e9cnicas y ahora son su gran soporte.\nPara Aid\u00e9 tener un negocio  ha sido su mejor empleo, este es su segundo cr\u00e9ditos con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, organizaci\u00f3n que la acogi\u00f3, cuando en otras hab\u00eda sido rechazada porque su edad no se ajustaba a los par\u00e1metros establecidos por esas empresas;   su negocio ha progresado pero sue\u00f1a con ser exitosa en la venta de mercanc\u00edas, actividad que conoce por su propia experiencia.\n\n","en":"Aid\u00e9e J. O. is 53 years old and lives in the neighborhood of Carrizal in Barranquilla.  She describes her neighborhood as being cheerful on every corner.  One can hear the music containing rhythms of \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Champeta\" target=\"_blank\" >champeta<\/a>\u201d that resonate from wooden boxes called \u201cpickup\u201d throughout the area.  Children and adults can\u2019t help but move to the sound of the music.\r\n<p>\r\nAid\u00e9e lives with her husband and has nine children between the ages of 25 and 39.  She sells lunches and occasionally merchandise.  She wants to gradually transition into her second business and is trying to make changes gradually away from selling lunches, but this process has been a great challenge.  For this reason, she is applying for a loan worth 1,000,000 COP to purchase bed sheets, towels, children\u2019s clothing, and shoes.\r\n<p>\r\nAid\u00e9e started her business with the help of a friend who has experience in buying merchandise from the Department of Guajira.  These products were well-received by her customers, but later Aid\u00e9e started traveling on her own to acquire appliances, clothing, and towels with good results.  She still remembers moving to Barranquilla at the age of 9 from Arenal, in the Department of Bolivar.  Aid\u00e9e was not able to finish high school due to several difficulties, so she decided to sell merchandise and eventually lunches to people in her neighborhood and from the surrounding areas.  Her children currently help her since they represent one of her successes.  She helped them get ahead since they were able to earn technical degrees and are now a great support.\r\n<p>\r\nFor Aid\u00e9e, having a business is the best form of employment.  This is her second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization that welcomed her when others rejected her because her age was not consistent with the parameters they established for these types of enterprises.  She has made progress in her business, but she still dreams of being successful in her merchandise sales because she knows she has the experience.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan

V. vende comidas r\u00e1pidas en su negocio llamado Rapi JuanK, que se ubica en la terraza de su casa donde vive con su esposa y sus dos hijos de 6 a\u00f1os y 8 meses de edad. Es habitante del barrio El Bosque en el suroccidente de Barranquilla, barrio grande que se extiende a lo largo de La Cordialidad, carretera que une la ciudad de Barranquilla con Cartagena.\nEn su negocio elabora perros calientes, hamburguesas y alimentos t\u00edpicos de la ciudad, tales como patacones rellenos (un tipo de frito elaborado con pl\u00e1tano) y salchipapas (papas con salchichas aderezadas con salsa de tomate). Inicialmente Juan Carlos fue empleado de un negocio igual al que tiene hoy y con los ahorros reunidos, logr\u00f3 comprar un carrito de perros calientes, con el cual se pudo independizar y utiliz\u00f3 su experiencia para comenzar su propio negocio. Acudi\u00f3 a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo para desarrollar su microempresa y con sus cr\u00e9ditos anteriores, logr\u00f3 mejorar parte de su infraestructura y compr\u00f3 una vitrina t\u00e9rmica que le permite mantener la temperatura adecuada de sus productos. Ahora solicita su segundo cr\u00e9dito con un monto de $ 2.000.000 y con este cr\u00e9dito comprar\u00e1 una carpa, para proteger su negocio en la temporada de la lluvia, que ya pronto empiezan, para hacer el mantenimiento de su carrito en el que elabora comidas y para adquirir algunas sillas y mesas adicionales y atender una mayor cantidad de clientes.\nJuan Carlos ya tiene planes para el futuro de su negocio: con su esposa est\u00e1 pensando en enrejar su negocio para aumentar su seguridad, adecuar un ba\u00f1o para prestar mejor servicio a los clientes y  colocar un reflector que le d\u00e9 una buena iluminaci\u00f3n.

He lives in the neighborhood called El Bosque in the southwest of Barranquilla. It is a big neighborhood that runs beside the highway, called La Cordialidad, that connects the city of Barranquilla with Cartagena. <p>\r\nAt his business, he makes hot dogs, hamburgers, and typical dishes of the city such as \"patacones rellonos\" (a fried snack made of plantain) and salchipapas (potatoes with sausage seasoned with a tomato sauce.) Initially, Juan Carlos was employed by a business just like the one he has today, and with the savings from his job he was able to buy a hot dog stall, which enabled him to be independent and he used his experience to start his own business. He came to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to develop his small business and with his previous loans he was able to improve part of his infrastructure and he bought a heated display unit that lets him keep his products at the proper temperature. Now he is requesting his second loan of a total of $1,050 and with this loan he will buy a canopy to protect his business when it rains, and the rainy season is nearly here. He will also use the loan for the maintenance of his stall in which he makes the food and to add some additional chairs and tables so that he can serve more clients. <p>\r\nJuan Carlos already has plans for the future of his business: with his wife, he is thinking of adding bars to his business to increase its security, adapting a restroom to offer a better facilities to the customers, and putting in a spotlight so things will be better lit. In relation to his children, he dreams of giving them a good education so that they can have a life of opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva

She is an uneducated lady because her parents were very poor and could hardly meet their financial expenses. This situation never made her feel disappointed at any time because she lives with the belief that although she never got much in her life her own kids will get all they need. She is a mother of three kids: two sons and one daughter. All of her kids are enrolled in a school and getting an education. \n\nBashiran's husband's name is M. R. and he is a cook by profession and runs his own food corner in the community. His food is based on Punjabi dishes such as \u201cDaal Chawal\" and \"Dahi Bhalas\u201d.  He selected this dishes because there\u2019s a tendency in Pakistani people  to prefer to eat Punjabi dishes rather than others. His business is going well and he earns Pak rupees 10,000 to 15,000 in a month. \n\nBashiran is a very supportive lady. She helps her husband in his business, which gives him strength to work harder. Bashiran\u2019s brother also lives with her and works in a factory, receiving a meager income. She knows that her brother is very hard-working and he is wasting his strength by doing an ordinary job. Therefore Bashiran has decided for him to start a timber-selling business. To start a business she requires a loan of Pak Rs. 15000 so he will be able to buy lumber in bulk.  \n\nBashiran is also a group leader for four other women from her community. Tahira M. wants a loan to buy groceries for her grocery shop. Kanizan baji wants a loan to buy goats for her animal-selling business. Lalan baji wants a loan to buy a donkey cart. Kosar baji wants a loan to buy mason's tools. \n\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\n\nNote: Bashiran baji is seated first on the left and all the other baji\u2019s are helping Tahira baji who is seated front right, arranging the plants.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":505179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber

She used the previous loans to buy more spare parts to increase her stock and has paid back the loans successfully. She hopes for a loan to increase her stock still more.\r\n\t\r\nSofia will share this loan with her subgroup of  Mlandizi Kati group, which totals seven members. These members deal in selling vegetables, drinks and clothes and have shops and a boutique. The members of the same group will hold each other accountable in paying back the loan.  \r\n\r\nIn the picture, Sofia is the tallest lady.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":504484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

Life in rural areas of the Dominican Republic can be hard, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare, among other problems. Despite these difficulties, Frank runs a successful \u201ccolmado\u201d, or small corner store. In colmados, people sell anything from bread to batteries. They are a staple of Dominican culture, a place that most local people visit daily. He will use this loan to buy perfume and food such as rice and beans to sell to his customers at a small markup. This is Frank\u2019s fifth loan with Esperanza International. Frank hopes to continue the growth of his business, and dreams of buying a home in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. \r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families from poverty through initiatives that generate income, education and health, and restore self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope.

She lives in Ciudad Modesto, a neighborhood in the southwest of Barranquilla, where she started her business offering video games.  Her business is registered in the Chamber of Commerce with the name Video Juegos S y K.  She started this business when she lost her job as a salesperson.  With her severance payment she initially set up her business in her sister\u2019s house, and later in its current location, very close to the main road, so her business is very well known.  \r\n\r\nScheylis has put an educational emphasis on her business, because her largest market is the neighbors' children.  They often leave their younger children there so that they can play.  They trust Scheylis because they know she loves to work with children and she cares for and protects them. Her mother, who is also a businesswoman and participates in this organization, recommended that Scheylis request a loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Scheylis is requesting a loan for $2.000.00 to purchase new games and possibly a computer, which will modernize her business and enable the children and young people to learn while they have fun.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her business, make it more comfortable, and offer promotions to attract new customers especially during school vacations when she has fewer customers.  In the future she also wants to improve her business by adding more computers and internet access, where she can offer more modern games which entertain the whole family and are interactive. \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge was to go from being an employee to an independent worker when the need to support her small child and a lack of work drove her to start this business.  She now enjoys it because she has time to care for her baby and to do other things while she is working. \r\n\r\nHer business is surrounded by many other businesses, such as hardware stores, ballrooms, and auto shops.  It is also next to the highway where there is a lot of public transportation, which provides easy access for her customers, and for her personal and business errands.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

M. is 65 years old and has four children who no longer depend on her.  She sells flowers at her stall in the square in front of the Universal Cemetery of Barranquilla.  She began to work with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo 11 years ago when a consultant observed her and saw her performance.  With the loan of 1,600 Colombian pesos she is asking for, she wants to stock up with artificial and fresh flowers like anthuriums, roses, flower buds, carnations and orchids, which she can get more economically in Maicao, a border city near Venezuela.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's flower sales business came into being after she abandoned the merchandise sales she had done in Maicao and moved to Barranquilla for security reasons.  She began her business selling flowers with a friend who had the capital, and they got equal profits after the sale.  As this went well for her, she decided to become independent, and during her eleven years with the Fundaci\u00f3n she has had much success with her business.  She says that her greatest challenge is the competition she gets from other people whom Mar\u00eda has taught how to sell flowers.  She used to sit in her tent waiting for people to come look for her, but now she looks for her customers around the cemetery, which has helped her to keep those customers and promote her business; the result is that people come to her, even people from other departments in Colombia whose loved ones are in other cemeteries.  They have a lot of confidence in her since she know how to preserve flowers  Her successes help her to make her dreams come true, and her main dream is to have more capital to supply her business, especially with fresh flowers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":505390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Stock artificial and fresh flowers like anthuriums, roses, flower buds, carnations and orchids","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-03-14T04:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1600000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71187},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76641},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78110},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79607},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81133},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82688},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84273},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85888},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87534},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":89212},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90922},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":92664},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94440},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96250},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98095},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":99975},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":101892},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":109489}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.93},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.63},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.4},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.23},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.11},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.82,"local_amount":71187,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":72781.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677885,"comment":null},{"amount":40.71,"local_amount":76641,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":78357.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712266,"comment":null},{"amount":41.5,"local_amount":78110,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":79859.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895766,"comment":null},{"amount":729.97,"local_amount":1374062,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1404832.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636093,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T00:05:48Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":184352,"name":"Trinidad \tAleida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa Sra.

The city is located 1236 meters (4055 feet) above sea level.  The state of VeraC., Mexico is characterized by its rainy season, which lasts for most of the year.  This is good for the cultivation of chayote squash, sugar cane, and other fruits that need lots of humidity.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group do different things, such as the sale of snacks, tortillas, dietary supplements, yogurt, etc.  Among them is Teresa, who is 46 years old, married, and has three children, ages, 21, 16, and 13.  She makes school uniforms, typical outfits, and outfits for school dances.  She started this business 20 years ago with a sewing machine that she inherited from her mother.  Now she has two others that she picked up and she and her niece make the uniforms.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for this loan so that she can buy fabric to make the products she sells.  According to her, the biggest accomplishment of the business is that she is able to offer the uniforms at 20% less than can be bought in stores, and with better quality of fabric and workmanship.  She hopes that over time, her earnings will allow her to buy two more sewing machines and be able to offer work in her shop to other people.\r\n\r\nShe is also paying for her oldest son\u2019s university education, because in her words, \u201cshe wants to give him the basis with which to face the future.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nMarisela: Food sales\r\nIrasema: Beauty salon\r\nGraciela: Food sales\r\nJosefina: Snack sales\r\nLiliana: Snack sales\r\nMar\u00eda: Snack sales\r\nAna: Natural herbs\r\nAlfonsina: Tortilla sales\r\nKaren: Cleaning supply sales\r\nMar\u00eda: Cosmetic sales\r\nCelia: Tortilla sales\r\n; \r\nCELIA S.

They retail their products from their homes, at the weekly market fairs in N\u2019Gassola and T\u00e9ss\u00e9r\u00e8la, for cash or credit, to a customer base of both men and women.\r\n\r\nThey hope to attain average monthly earnings of 22,050 FCFA each, part of which will be used to reimburse the Soro Yiriwaso loan, and contribute towards the children\u2019s healthcare and tuition costs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":505444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy various items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"T\u00e9ss\u00e9r\u00e8la Barou\u00e9li","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-13T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9lika                               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Satou       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimatou    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Ma\u00efmouna      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seli\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa\t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":125770.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746548,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":125770.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779091,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":125770.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961292,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":125770.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699416,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":125770.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913337,"comment":null},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":125770.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180511,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-15T16:15:54Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":184391,"name":"Santos Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"      El se\u00f1or Santos Alberto Estrada vive en una casa prE. junto con su esposa y sus dos hijos.\nComo desea tener su propia casa vivienda est\u00e1 tramitando una casa por medio de infonavit (Cr\u00e9dito Gubernamental), pero el valor de la vivienda es superior al cr\u00e9dito que el puede recibir ya que su sueldo es bajo.\nEl trabaja como empleado en una compa\u00f1\u00eda de trasportes.

She started this type of work on her own initiative. She used to work on a farm and the owners of the property allowed her to use an area of four blocks on the property to plant basic grains such as beans and corn. With the sale of the crop, she had more income. In this way, the owners of the property helped her. Now, in order to improve her income, she works at the other activity buying and selling cattle. The expectation she has with buying and selling cattle is to grow her operations and have another type of income. Before, she only had income during harvest time and now she has more operations and more work all year.    \r\n.\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda Adali E. is married and has 3 children.

It is one of the most visited places by tourists from all over the world. The villagers are very hospitable and well-wishing people. One of them is Mira B., the leader of this group.\r\n\r\nWhen Mira\u2019s husband died, only her newborn son gave her the strength to go ahead. She totally dedicated herself to her son. Still, a wound that has never healed sometimes cuts the ground from under her feet but, looking at how her son is growing up and how he just looks like his father, she understands that life is terrific.\r\n\r\nAlso, Mira has understood that wishes do not wash dishes, so she has had to do something for a living. With 500 KGS ($12) in her pocket, she started her little business selling a particular sort of potatoes, which later on turned out to be big business. Now Mira deals with the harvest of potatoes and sells them in the market. Her revenue is 3,450 KGS ($80) and she gets a pension of about 716 KGS ($16). She is planning to provide education for her son and to buy a house.\r\n\r\nMira decided to buy 500kg of potatoes with the loan which she wants to obtain from Mol Bulak Finance.\r\n\r\nAnarkul K. is a forty-seven-year-old married woman with three children. Her eldest daughter is a student and the rest are schoolboys. Her husband is a driver for a company and earns 8,000 KGS ($180). She makes national items and sells them. She started her business with 2,000 KGS ($45) and her revenue is now 4,000 KGS ($90). She plans to provide education for her children, marry off her eldest son and finish building a shed. She wants to obtain a loan for sowing wheat.\r\n\r\nKurmanbubu T. is a fifty-year-old woman who is married and has a daughter. Her husband works for a company and his salary is from 3,000 KGS ($70) to 7,000 KGS ($160). She makes national items to sell and her profit is 2,000 KGS ($45) per month. She wants to obtain a loan to buy materials for making more items.\r\n\r\nAynura S. is a thirty-seven-year-old married woman. She has a husband and two children. Her husband is a worker and earns 15,000 KGS ($340) in the summer. She has a shop where she sells daily foodstuffs and her revenue is 10,000 KGS ($227) per month. By obtaining a loan she wants to buy a refrigerator for ice cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

M. (pictured with Christina from the Kiva team) is 26 years old, married, has a four month old son, and resides in the subdivision of La Playa, which is a rural area of Barranquilla.  She lives in a rented house with her parents, where she also has a space set aside for her business called \u201cSala de Belleza Milena M.\u201d (Milena M.\u2019s Beauty Parlor).  There she offers a variety of services such as hairstyling, manicures, pedicures, and haircuts.  Milena began cutting hair six years ago and started her own beauty salon four years ago with the help of her parents.  She now has 120 established clients and several others who come to her shop occasionally.  Milena also provides home services.  \n\nShe has been affiliated with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo since 2008 and her previous loan was used to buy equipment for her work, which was a great help to her.  In addition, she has different administration skills she desires to keep up to date so she attends seminars to refresh her knowledge.  Milena is requesting a loan of 2,300,000 COP to buy a backwash station (for shampooing hair), salon chairs for adults and children, and a minisplit (a small air conditioning unit).  With the development of her business, she hopes to fulfill her dreams:  open her own beauty salon in Barranquilla and purchase the house that is being rented by her parents.     <br

He started working as an farm worker and little by little was able to acquire a small land parcel where he usually plants forage (alfalfa) and tubers. He tells us that he can't plant the whole lot because of its closeness to the sea. Its land is salinated and the crops don't survive in that type of soil. \r\n\r\nThat is why his business of raising and selling sheep is so important. It supplies the income he needs to support his family. He raises the sheep in a corral installed in the back of his house and sells them to dealers who usually visit the area where he lives.  The forage he plants is used to raise the sheep. \r\n\r\nSebastian wants to maintain his alfalfa crop to assure good feed for his sheep. This is why he is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 2000 nuevos soles. He plans on using it to buy foliar fertilizer to fertilize he crop he has planted.  \r\n\r\nHe is a very honest and hardworking man.

He is dependent on these activities to pay for the family's expenses and so he always strives to work as hard as possible.\r\n\r\nNicolas has approached Edpyme Alternativa to solicit a loan of 1500 new soles, which he needs to makes some improvements to his home since the sea breeze fills his walls with salt and they need maintenance so that it doesn't damage the structure.\r\n\r\nHe is a very responsible father, dedicated to his family. His neighbors and acquaintances consider him to be a trustworthy person. He has already worked previously with our institution and has proved to be a responsible client who is punctual at payment time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":505517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"Expenses for maintenance and repairs to his home.

She will invest this loan in a sewing machine since the one she has is very old and fails a lot. Her motivation is to achieve economic stability and her dream is to have an established bakery in the center of the city.

Life in rural areas of the Dominican Republic can be tough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare among other issues. Despite these difficulties, Sory has a successful small business selling clothing to people in her community. With this loan, she will buy underwear, women\u2019s pants, and bedsheets to sell at a small markup.\r\n\r\nThis is Sory\u2019s eighth loan with Esperanza International. In less than three years, she has been able to increase her loan size by nearly ten times, a true testament to her hard work. With continued profits, Sory hopes to keep the growth of her business going and finish the construction of her home in order to give her family a more comfortable place to live (a common construction technique in the Dominican Republic is to build in stages as one acquires the money to do so). In addition, her profits have given Sory confidence that her children will grow up with a good education and have the opportunity to pursue any profession they desire, a luxury Sory did not have while growing up.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, and that restore self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope.

Her home is located two blocks away, on the same street.  She carries a large variety of products, despite the fact that the space she occupies is small.  Elvira is married and has 3 daughters, ages 22, 15, and 12.  They are all studying, one in the university and the other two in school.  Her husband is a locksmith and works in the Obrajes zone of the city.  They tell us they started with nothing and, through hard work, managed to buy a little house and put themselves in an acceptable financial situation.  \r\n\r\nThey are very proud of their work, and always demonstrate responsibility with their loan payments.  They are a very tight-knit family.  Elvira\u2019s wish is to see her daughters all become professionals.  She will use the money from the loan to buy merchandise to supply her store.

Esta familia vive en su acogedora casa propia.   \n\nDesde hace 9 a\u00f1os, junto a su esposo, se dedica a cultivar caf\u00e9, ma\u00edz y pl\u00e1tano, y para ahorrar en el transporte, las \u00e9pocas de cosecha contratan operarios por mes y se van a radicar a la chacra donde ella prepara los alimentos muy temprano y ayuda a su pareja en sus labores agr\u00edcolas para avanzar con rapidez.\nA Dina le gusta disfrutar de la tranquilidad del campo, sin embargo le parece dif\u00edcil trasladar sus productos hasta los mercados de abastos o los acopiadores, pues recorre un camino distante y peligroso.\nAunque este oficio le parece sacrificado, es muy rentable porque gracias a las utilidades que obtiene puede brindarles una adecuada calidad de vida a sus hijos. Es por ello que para el futuro piensa cultivar caf\u00e9 en mayor cantidad para incrementar sus ganancias.\n\nEsta es  la segunda vez que tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y asegura que pagando puntualmente cada cuota se demostr\u00f3 a ella misma que con perseverancia todo se puede. As\u00ed tambi\u00e9n le gusta trabajar en su banco comunal, donde aprendi\u00f3 a sociabilizar con otras personas que no conoc\u00eda, por eso se muestra contenta al sentir que tiene una grande y hermosa familia. \n\nCon los mil quinientos soles que solicita comprar\u00e1 dos sacos de abono, dos mil quinientas plantas de caf\u00e9 de la variedad \u201cCatemur\u201d, muy solicitada por producir granos grandes y de mejor calidad.

They have three children and this family has a home of their own.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been raising coffee, corn, and bananas for the past nine years.  To save on transportation, they hire monthly operatives during the harvest season, and they travel to the farmland where she prepares the food very early in the morning and then helps her husband with the farm work in order to finish quickly.\r\n\r\nDina likes the tranquility of the countryside, but she finds it difficult to transport her goods to the marketplaces, suppliers, and storehouses.  The trip is long and dangerous.\r\n\r\nEven though it\u2019s a sacrifice, it\u2019s very profitable because, thanks to her skills, she is able to give a good life to her children.  This is the reason that she is planning to increase her coffee production, so that she can increase her income.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan through MFP and she guarantees that she will make each payment on time and prove that everything is possible with perseverance.  She likes working with a communal bank, where she learned to socialize with other people whom she didn\u2019t know before, and she is happy to have this large and beautiful family.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan of 1,500 PEN ($550) to buy sacs of fertilizer and 2,500 coffee plants, of the \u201cCatemur\u201d variety.

Afterwards she began bringing in fish from Tasajera, the location of the magistrate for the Department of Bol\u00edvar.  She also bought a cooler for storing them.

G. sells merchandise through catalogs such as men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing, perfumes, and accessories.  She also produces hand-knitted purses, blouses, tablecloths, and fabrics.  Carmen is 34 years old and has two sons, ages 6 and 9.  She lives in the July 20th neighborhood of Barranquilla, which is a mixture of business and residential areas.  In this neighborhood, you will find shopping centers, supermarkets, the metropolitan soccer stadium, inns, taverns, and numerous residential buildings and houses.  \r\n<p>\r\nCarmen started her business in 2000 when a neighbor taught her how to knit.   She was still working as a salesperson at a department store in Barranquilla.  The birth of her son in 2001 forced her to quit her job so that she could dedicate herself to taking care of her baby.  Her customers consist of neighbors, friends, relatives, and people who have been recommended to her.  Although there is significant competition, she maintains her clientele because of the quality of her service and the prices she offers.  Every 21 days, she places orders for her catalog products and also purchases items that are not found in the catalogs but are frequently requested.  She has had three previous loans with the Foundation that have enabled her to increase her income and educate her children.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of 1,500,000 COP that she requested, Carmen will invest in the purchase of catalog merchandise such as clothing, perfumes, accessories, as well as wholesale yarn for cash.  She also plans to buy wooden utensils and ornaments made of stone.  Carmen says her biggest challenges are the lack of operating capital and not having her own home.  Sometime later, she dreams of buying a house and expanding her business with the loans provided by Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She lives in the Guaranda district of Bol\u00edvar province.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the Grupo Enmanuel rural credit union, which is located 45 minutes away from Guaranda, the capital of Bol\u00edvar province. There are 17 members of the group; it is an agricultural and livestock-farming community of indigenous people who all speak Quechua. Maria works in agriculture in order to increase her family income. The crops that do best are corn, broadbeans, lentils and barley. She also raises domesticated animals such as cattle, chicken, sheep and pigs, which she sells from home and she sells her harvests in the wholesale market of Guaranda every six months.\r\n\r\nThe main cultural activity is carnival, which is celebrated every year in February. Maria also likes to wash, cook and sew.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy supplies for her work in the fields, mostly for chemical and organic fertilizers. Her goal is to have a good source of income for her family. The challenges she faces are problems due to weather and diseases that affect the crops.\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":505623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guaranda","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":159,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Zoila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":287.08,"local_amount":287.08,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":287.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166828676,"comment":null},{"amount":312.92,"local_amount":312.92,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-19T08:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":312.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196352719,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-15T20:45:25Z","paid_date":"2011-03-19T08:10:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":184509,"name":"Wi\u00f1ay Muju Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal \u201cWi\u00f1ay Muju\u201d esta representado por el se\u00f1or Primitivo y conformado por 10 socios de los cuales 3 son hombres y resto son mujeres es un grupo muy unido y trabajador como lo ha demostrado en su anterior ciclo demostrando siempre responsabilidad en sus pagos y unidad en su grupo.

It is located in the Cuautlapan community, in the municipality of Ixtaczoquitlan in the state of VeraC., Mexico. The group is maD. up of 13 members. Alejandra O. M. is the president of the group - she sells snacks (peanuts, seeds, pork scratchings) and she has asked for 3,000 pesos with which to buy ingredients to prepare her snacks. Also in the group is Mrs. Rosa Maria C. F. who is 34 years old and only went to primary school. She makes and sells tamales, which she sells in the streets from a cart. On Wednesdays she sells them together with her husband who works in the same business. They have been selling tamales for 21 years and she is asking for a loan in order to buy plantain leaves in which to wrap the tamales. She is married and has 4 children of 19, 17, 15 and 12 years of age. She began selling tamales from her house but after the birth of her children she needed to go out with her husband into the street to sell them and increase their sales. This business is the family's only source of income; thanks to the business they have been able to build a house on land they inherited and educate their children, all of whom are currently studying and also helping to sell tamales. As well as buying a small second-hand van to use to transport the tricycle from which they sell their tamales to other communities and increase their sales, she dreams of one day buying some land and having rooms for rent and securing a future for when she can no longer work, and perhaps buying a new car. All of this will help to grow her business thanks to loans. <p> The other members of this group and their occupations are: <p> Elizabeth H. F., selling clothes; <p>  Guadalupe Fidelia R.

For the past 10 years, she has been selling breakfast and lunch from a stall in the park within her district.

The business has been very welcomed, especially by the workers who work in the shops located around the perimeter of the zone.  They prefer Fanny\u2019s business because they like the good service and the enthusiasm with which she prepares the food.\r\n\r\nBecause of the high demand, Fanny would like to expand her business and set up another stall that will be run by a member of her family.  In order to meet this objective, she is asking for her first loan, through Edpyme Alternativa, of 1,000 PEN ($375) to buy furniture and utensils.\r\n\r\nFanny is a very hard working and enterprising woman with a high regard for commitment and responsibility.  Her greatest desire is to open a restaurant within the zone.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":505663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Set up a second food stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ort\u00edz - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-16T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanny Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.12},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":42.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":42.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":42.82},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":43.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":44.02},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":44.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":45.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.53},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":46.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":46.68},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":47.29},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":48.07},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":48.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.8},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.91},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.03},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.06},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.26},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.08},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.73},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.03},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.04},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.28},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.74,"local_amount":127.3,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":135.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934685,"comment":null},{"amount":65.22,"local_amount":173.92,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":184.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662306,"comment":null},{"amount":67.18,"local_amount":179.16,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":190.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695010,"comment":null},{"amount":86.71,"local_amount":231.22,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":245.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878055,"comment":null},{"amount":71.7,"local_amount":191.2,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":203,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618083,"comment":null},{"amount":36.45,"local_amount":97.2,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":103.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832486,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T02:06:51Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":184528,"name":"Glenda Maricela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el barrio S\u00f3crates Sandino Municipio de Somotillo \nLa se\u00f1ora T.
