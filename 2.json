Sarah is a committed member of her church in Nkoroi. They hold meetings for the young single mothers - the meetings have made the young mothers to dedicate their lives to God and start up income generating activities. Sarah also assists her two younger brothers who were left by their mother when she passed away. The two are in primary school at the moment, she provides books and uniforms. Sarah has attended several trainings under WEEC program. Grace\u2019s group runs a revolving fund and it was started in 2003. She has been the group treasurer for the last 3 years. Sarah\u2019s husband was employed as a matatu driver. She asked her husband to save part of his salary and after two years she took a loan added it to the husband\u2019s savings and they bought a reconditioned matatu.

So she needs to invest $2,305 but she only has $1,380, and for this reason Ana Maria needs a loan of $925 and 6 months to repay. She has to take advantage of this opportunity because this situation will eventually let her open a boutique with new and better quality of clothing. She will also gain new clients and more than she has now. This will help to be prepared for the new season and her earnings will grow as well.<\/p><\/p><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><p><p>SPANISH<\/p><\/p><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><p><p>Ana Mar\u00eda, es una madre de familia divorciada y con 2 hijos, qui\u00e9n para salir adelante y poder darles educaci\u00f3n comenz\u00f3 a vender entre sus vecinos y amigos ropa usada.

Now, the one-room store is big enough to employ P., his wife and two daughters, both in their 20s, and support their four children.

Being a single mother, she has to work hard to increase her income and this is why she wants to start selling steers in order to increase her income inflow. This is the only way she will be able to educate her children and maintain good standard of living. To Nayioma and her group members, the revival of the Kenya Meat Commission is a blessing because it\u2019s providing ready market for cattle in the whole area. They will be selling their cattle at realistic prices unlike previously where the market was limited and the buyers determining what to offer. With this in mind, Nayioma wants to increase Steers to a point where in future she will be able to rear 20 steers at a time. However, like a river which starts from a small point and then it flows, she would like to start with 3 and then reach 20 or more.<\/p><\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Nayioma wants to buy 3 medium size steers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Isinya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.6 36.95","type":"point"}},"partner_id":6,"posted_date":"2006-09-12T07:38:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nayioma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-09-28T03:18:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2006-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2006-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":10,"local_amount":10,"processed_date":"2006-11-17T12:27:26Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-05T09:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":2372,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2006-12-15T14:23:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-05T09:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":3161,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2007-01-25T23:33:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-05T09:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5315,"comment":"scheduled payment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-03-02T02:01:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-05T09:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":8425,"comment":"scheduled payment"},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-04-05T09:10:09Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-05T09:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":12382,"comment":"scheduled repayment"},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-06-05T09:15:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-05T09:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20300,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T09:15:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-05T09:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29082,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-08-05T09:15:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-05T09:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39011,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2006-09-14T03:18:00Z","paid_date":"2007-08-05T09:15:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":809,"name":"Tureto","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Tureto is a member of Inkiramat women group which is located in Empuyiankat, Kajiado District.

Merchan was born in Manabi, Ecuador and is a 44 year-old single woman. She own a small business, selling various household items in the Municipal de Basti\u00f3n Popular. She starts work at 6am every day and usually closes her shop around 5pm. Her parents taught her how to operate the store, as they were the previous owners before Melvis took over. In the four years since she has been the proprietor of Bazar Melvis, Ms. Merchan has gained the customer loyalty she needs to now expand.

In the family\u2019s main room, Radka, Atanas, their two sons, and a variety of cousins, aunts and uncles shell the walnuts.  Atanas then takes the nuts to one of several walnut processing companies with whom he works, which then clean and package the nuts and distribute them into grocery markets across Bulgaria.  In a two-week processing period, the family nets 250BGN (160USD).\r\n\r\nThis loan will play a crucial role in increasing the amount of working capital available to Radka and Atanas.  Currently, they have to wait several weeks to be paid by the large companies after dropping off the shelled nuts.  During this waiting period, they do not have the funds on hand to purchase a new load of walnuts to shell\u2026 so they wait instead of work.  With this capital, they\u2019ll be able to dramatically increase the velocity of their business, increasing by 50% \u2013 75% the amount of nuts they can shell in a year.  \r\n\r\nRadka is proud of

is a 35-year-old Roma living in Sliven, Bulgaria.  For the last 10 years, Yordan has supported his wife and two children (aged 14 and 17) by his work with walnuts.  Yordan drives around Bulgaria buying walnuts in their shells by the sack.  Upon his return to Sliven, he weighs the sacks and gives each to one of his independent contractors.  The contractor removes the walnuts from their shells and returns the shelled walnuts to Yordan.  Weighing the sacks before their distribution lets Yordan know approximately how many kilos of shelled nuts should be returned, to prevent his contractors from siphoning off his nuts.  Yordan provides work for approx 50 people for 5 days when he brings in a load of nuts to be shelled.  Yordan then sells his walnuts at the major nut markets in Sofia and Burgas.  <p>\r\n\r\nCurrently, Yordan can afford to buy 2,000BGN (1,300USD) worth of walnuts at a time, which he sells 10 days later for 2,500BGN (1,625USD).  After salaries and expenses (gas for his van to drive around Bulgaria buying and selling the nuts), Yordan nets approximately 200BGN (130USD), which he can do every two weeks or so.  This loan will give him the capital to increase the amount of nuts he can buy at a time (nearly double), employing more people in the Roma ghetto of Sliven.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe Roma, commonly referred to as gypsies, is a severely marginalized social group in the Balkans.

She is a window with 5 grown up children. Mary was amongst the first people who settled in Kware, Rongai. A staunch Catholic, Mary and a few Catholic faithful rented a room in Kware where they were holding their prayers and Sunday service. <p>\r\n\r\nFor many years has been actively involved in preaching the word of God. Mary has seen the congregation of St Mary\u2019s Catholic Church grow from very few faithful members to the large congregation to date. Mary is a serious and hard working lady.  She started by growing and selling maize, beans, potatoes, peas and vegetables. From this small business, she saved and bought a small plot of land in Kandisi.  As years went by, she specialized in growing maize and beans which are seasonal, and vegetables for her daily income. <p>\r\n\r\nMary decided to move her family to Kandisi, a residential area near Rongai after she had built a semi-permanent house. She then built 6 semi-permanent rooms in Kware in a plot she had bought when she was staying there and rented them out at USD 4 per month. The income from these rooms enabled her to buy a cow. The reason she decided to buy a cow was that many people wanted milk but it was little in the area and expensive. She now has three dairy cows and at least she gets 40 litres per day. She sells 37 litres and lives 3 litres for her family. She gets USD 15 per day from the sale of milk and USD 5 from vegetables. <p>\r\n\r\nRecently the Olkejuado County Council demarcated Kware plots and gave title deeds to the old residents. Mary was lucky to have been allocated one.  Mary plans to start by upgrading 4 rooms and to have the construction done within one month. After renovation, she will rent them at USD 15. Mary\u2019s future plan is to install electricity and water to make life easy for her tenants.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Mary wants to renovate her rental rooms.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

Lopez was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador. She has been selling car parts and accessories for six years now. Her father taught her all about the business since he ran a similar business for most of his life. When she was 20 years old, Eufemia opened Isa Express and slowly she grew the business to where is stands today. Her father helped her financially by giving her the money to purchase a property which happens to be located next to her cousins. The shop is centrally located and attracts a lot of attention from customers. In fact, Eufemia reports that many people come to her simply because they work at the factory next door. \u201cThey search for my services, and I deliver,\u201d she says. Ms. Lopez is asking for this loan to be able to purchase spark plugs, filters, spare electronic parts, and motor oil. Her goal is to be able to repair everything in-house so that the job can get done more quickly for her clients. The attention she gives her customers is personal, and she hopes to receive this loan so that she can afford to pay an employee to work Saturdays, which are the busiest days when it comes to car repair.\r\n\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMifex offers its clients microinsurance and access to business training and educational programs.

Four years ago she started her business, where she offers fruits, vegetables and groceries. Actually, her youngest sons are students at school and support her in the small business. In addition, her oldest one supports her by selling goats in the nearby communities into \u201clos d\u00edas de plaza\u201d (market day) and this is why they share the credit for both businesses.<p>\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan of $550 USD to be able to supply her business, because when her children go back to school, she has a lot of expenses. And now she needs the working capital to help supply her business and buy some goats to sell in different community markets.

The story of this widowed mother is a testament to the power of microcredit, and Mifex thanks her for her continued efforts. Not only has she built economic value for her family but Carmen has given a sense of pride and motivation to them as well. As the head of the household, Ms. R. constantly works to feed her children and continue running the business. With the increased profits she realized from her first loan, she was able to buy a rotisserie oven for chicken, allowing her to manage the time better. In the morning Carmen purchases and prepares the food, and in the afternoon she can focus on selling it in her newly refurbished market and even doing deliveries. Carmen also makes tasty food called \u201cchifles,\u201d which are fried plantains. She makes these especially for the high school and college students who love to eat at her restaurant\/market. <p>\r\n\r\nCarmen has been able hire a few hired hands to sell her products, helping to distribute the \u201cchifles\u201d to people around the busy market areas. Ms. R. lives in a marginalized sector of Guayaquil, Ecuador with her three children. Her goal over the past six months has been to attract new clients to her store, and Mifex has seen firsthand the change even in that period of time. With more than 13 years experience in this particular line of business, Carmen is a veteran, and her continued involvement in the Kiva microcredit program has brought more growth than ever before. She hopes continued access to credit will help to pay for food, clothing, medicine, and education for her family. Her second loan will go toward buying display cases and other marketing materials to promote the products which have gained somewhat of brand loyalty of her side of town.

paid off her first Kiva loan on time, and she has plans for growing her business even more. The growth she has experience over the last six months has been amazing. By giving her access to credit, Mifex and Kiva gave Ms. Q. the ability to explore new product lines and take advantage of the niche market for party supplies like pi\u00f1atas y sorpresas . With a different fiesta just about every two weeks in Ecuador, Luz has positioned herself as one of the best \u2018mom and pop\u2019 shops in Guayaquil. Geographically, Luz is lucky to be where she is along major thoroughfares in the marginal part of the city. She has over 25 years of experience and originally began her business with $10 selling toys to children. Realizing that she only had gift items and toys for Christmas, she soon began to purchase inventory for other holidays and parties. Her children help lend a hand in running the business, and they all report a better standard of living from six months ago. With the increased income, Luz has been able to afford more food for the family as well as more working capital to invest back into her shop. Now that she no longer has to rely on the chulqueros who charge 20% monthly, Luz is asking Mifex and Kiva for a second loan so she can purchase more supply in cash and take advantage of the rebates and discounts being offered.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do\u00f1a Luz is glad that there is organization like Kiva using technology to help the poor in Guayaquil, Ecuador, for in the past, she had no other option but the loan sharks. Not only did she repay her loan on time, but she is now in need of another loan from Mifex and Kiva. She explains that another loan would be a boon for her company, for she would be able to invest more in wholesale products, introducing new product lines, and increasing her income. In addition to managing her business, Do\u00f1a Luz manages her home and pays for her childrens' schooling.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mifex offers its clients microinsurance and access to business training and educational programs.

Her personality and relationship with her customer is a great plus for her business.

She says that without the guidance fro her father, who taught her the business, she would be where she is today. When she got married, Ms. A. did not quit the business, but continued so that she and her husband could bring in two sources of income. Starting out by selling 1-2 chickens per day on the street corner, Martha has surely come a long way, selling 20-30 chickens on average.
