It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in a rented house and is ready to work very hard to get ahead in life.  Although she is very young, Rosa knows how to work very hard to have a better quality of life.  That is why she decided to start a business selling Irapay leaves (leaves used in the jungle to thatch roofs).  So every morning she buys these leaves from the cargo boats that come from the islands in the Yanrinacocha lagoon.  What she likes best about her work is selling the leaves since she always gets a good price and this generates income so that she can support her family. Rosa has been doing this for 4 years and what she says is the hardest is transporting the leaves, since they are very big and heavy.  In the future she would like to start a business selling the strips, material made of wood that supports the leaves. \r\nThis will be her second loan with MFP.  She hopes that each one of you will support her in developing her business.  She is a very responsible and punctual member of her communal bank.

She has lived in the city of Barranquilla since 1980, when she arrived from Quind\u00edo, the department where she was born. She began working for the owner of a kiosk, a job where she got most of her experience, which she later used to begin her own business. When the kiosk owner left and she rented the business, she began to work on her own. However, 7 months later the owner asked Luz to hand it back over to him. This is how she found herself needing to start in another location. She opened a kiosk with the support of the soft drink companies. From that moment on, things went well for her because these companies helped her with infrastructure and merchandise. However, a little while later, she had to move her kiosk a few meters in the same area because someone built a wall and started a business there. This worked out well for her because the employees there are her main customers of soft drinks, fried foods, cigarettes, and the other foods that she sells.\r\n\r\nLuz is a very hardworking and persistent woman. She lives in a neighborhood in the south of Barranquilla and she gets up very early to commute every day to the north of the city to tend to her business. In addition to the employees of the business that is located so close to her kiosk, she has many customers in the neighborhood because she is located right in an industrial area. This has helped with the sustainability of her business and it has allowed her to support her family, though now her children work independently and contribute to the household expenses. Her dream is to have a quiet time in her old age, enjoying her work. \r\n\r\nLuz is applying for her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she will use to improve her kiosk and to buy ingredients so she can add a lunch service. She has potential customers for this because of the characteristics of the area and also because she is well known for the foods that she sells to her customers at mid-morning. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":793130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients for preparing lunches so she can add lunch service ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-21T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55005},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":56059},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":57134},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":58229},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":59345},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":60482},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":61642},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":62823},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":64027},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":65254}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.09},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.28},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.09,"local_amount":55005,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":57530.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673847,"comment":null},{"amount":32.7,"local_amount":56059,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":58633.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320405,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":57134,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":59757.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803524,"comment":null},{"amount":33.96,"local_amount":58229,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":60902.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614611,"comment":null},{"amount":34.62,"local_amount":59345,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-19T08:53:33Z","rounded_local_amount":62069.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568566,"comment":null},{"amount":183.3,"local_amount":314228,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":328656.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779906,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-06T23:09:10Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":308720,"name":"Mma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mma sells banku at Abura, near nyame bekyere.

She is very elderly but Benedicto and Martina are grateful that she is still with them, because when they are at work she helps with the children's education. Marina's mother looks after the children because Martina has to milk the cows and make cheese, which she sells in the village to obtain some extra income, and Benedicto works the land to sow his crops. \r\n\r\nBenedicto is a hard working and responsible man. He works hard to get ahead. He is requesting a loan to buy seeds and poultry manure in order to increase his income. This will help him support his children until they finish school.

She has worked in this place for two years. She is well-known in the area and there is no nearby competition. \r\n\r\nVioleta is requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 100 soles to perform maintenance on her food cart and buy services and supplies, since her customer base has been expanding. The place where she sells her food is well-traveled since it is located near a place where motorcycles stop. \r\n\r\nVioleta is a very responsible mother who wants her family to achieve a better quality of life. She works hard each day toward this aim, so she can contribute in covering her household's expenses.

She lives in her own house with her husband Aliardo, 35, and their 2 beloved children.  Ximena is age 12 and Kiara is 8, and she wants to provide a better quality of life for them.  \r\n\r\nRosa is a seller of beauty products that are in high demand in her neighborhood.  She is always well informed about the new products that have come to market, and she doesn't miss the opportunity to give one or two pieces of beauty advice to her regular customers. She enjoys selling her products and even more so when it is her own merchandise. She has been in this business for 9 years and hopes later on to open a beauty salon where she can sell her cosmetics, because it is very difficult currently to go into all the places where she sells her beauty products and charge them individually. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP,  therefore she hopes for the support of every one of you.  She also promises to meet her quotas, and has faith in her business and knows it will be fine. With the thousand new soles requested, she will buy more cosmetics to increase her stock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":794994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy more beauty products.

Durante el verano aprovecha de vender chalas para hombres, mujeres y ni\u00f1os. Durante invierno, temporada actual aprovecha de vender botas para todas las edades entre hombres, mujeres y ni\u00f1os. Adem\u00e1s vende cosm\u00e9ticos y ropa nueva en menor cantidad. Trabaja los d\u00edas martes, mi\u00e9rcoles, viernes y fines de semana, con un horario de 10\u00ba\u00ba 15\u00ba\u00ba, durante la tarde se dedica a realizar labores domesticas en su hogar. Mabel comenta, que ha conocido mucha gente a lo largo de su trabajo y cuenta con una gran cantidad de clientes, ya que es la \u00fanica que se dedica a vender zapatos nuevos en la feria. Mabel comenz\u00f3 vendiendo ropa de segunda mano en el suelo, con los a\u00f1os su situaci\u00f3n ha mejorado, ya que en la actualidad cuenta con un puesto y permiso legal para su instalaci\u00f3n. \nSu mercader\u00eda la compra al por mayor, en distribuidoras donde los precios son a bajo costo y m\u00e1s conveniente para su inversi\u00f3n. \nCon el cr\u00e9dito comprar\u00e1 botas para abastecer su negocio durante la temporada de invierno.\nSus metas son continuar con su negocio y abastecerse de mercader\u00eda, para ahorrar dinero y finalmente comprarse un veh\u00edculo que le permita trasladar su mercader\u00eda a la feria, ya que por ahora solo cuenta con un triciclo, el cual limita su espacio para comprar m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda. \nSu motivaci\u00f3n de continuar con su negocio se debe a la flexibilidad horaria que le deja su trabajo, ya que le ha permitido acrecentar su relaci\u00f3n familiar y criar a su hija. \nMabel vive junto a su esposo y sus tres hijas de 15, 12 y 6 a\u00f1os de edad.\nElla se encuentra muy contenta y agradecida del apoyo brindado por Fondo Esperanza, desde la facilidad para optar al cr\u00e9dito, hasta la buena relaci\u00f3n existente al interior del grupo del Banco comunal. Son personas muy buenas, cari\u00f1osas, confiables y esforzadas.

Es un vocablo del mapudungun (lengua mapuche) que se traduce como \u201clugar donde se juntan las aguas\u201d o \u201clugar de charcos\u201d, debido a que posee una variada red fluvial compuesta por el r\u00edo Mapocho y los esteros Lampa, Car\u00e9n y Las Cruces, lo que favorece sus suelos para la producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola por la existencia de abundante agua subterr\u00e1nea.\n\n","en":"Mabel is part of the \"Mi Banco Mi Amigo 2\" [\"My Bank My Friend 2\"] community bank, belonging to the Pudahuel municipality in the city of Santiago.\r\nShe has worked in commerce for 4 years, in various flea markets, selling products based on the season. During the summer she enjoys selling sandals for men, women and children. In the winter, the current season, she enjoys selling boots for men, women and children of all ages. She also sells cosmetics and a small amount of new clothing. She works Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and weekends, from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm. In the afternoon she does the housework in her home. Mabel says that she has gotten to know many people through her work, and she has a large customer base because she is the only person who sells new shoes in the market. Mabel started off selling second hand clothing outside on the ground, and with the passing of the years her situation has improved, since she now has a stall and legal permission for her business.\r\nShe buys her merchandise wholesale, from distributors whose prices are low, making them convenient for her investment.\r\nWith her loan, she will purchase boots to stock her business for the winter season.\r\nHer goals are to continue with her business and stock up on merchandise, in order to save money and finally buy herself a vehicle, which will allow her to transport her merchandise to the market. She currently only has a tricycle, which limits her space for buying more merchandise.\r\nShe is motivated to continue with her business because it gives her a flexible schedule, and has allowed her to improve her family relationships and raise her daughter.\r\nMabel lives with her husband and three daughters ages 15, 12 and 6.\r\nShe is very happy, and she is grateful for the support offered by Fondo Esperanza--from the ease of taking out a loan to the good relationships among the members of the communal bank. They are very good, loving, trustworthy and hard-working people. Mabel participates actively in the meetings, as she is also the group secretary. She feels very comfortable there and it provides her with something to do. She says that the workshops in the meetings have been very useful in helping her to apply what she has learned in her business.\r\nPudahuel is a community in the west of Santiago (the capital of Chile), in the Metropolitana region. Metropolitana is a word in Mapudungun (the Mapuche language) which translates as \"place where the waters join\" or \"place of the puddles\", since it has a varied network of rivers made up of the Mapocho river and the Lampa, Car\u00e9n and Las Cruces streams. This provides a favourable soil for agricultural production due to the existence of abundant subterranean water.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":795010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to

She recalls that, before she owned her pharmacy, she used to sell her medicines by knocking on doors, moving from one village to the next.  She served a lot of patients as the doctors didn't get out as far as these places.  The nearest health center was more than four hours away.  Andrea took advantage of this fact.  She saw that her sales were increasing gradually and sustainably, and she already had an established customer base.  Andrea therefore decided to make inroads into the medicine sales business.

Her business is located in front of her home in the neighborhood of July 20th Ciudadela.  This area has a mix of formal and informal businesses, recreation facilities, residential areas, and is mainly known as the site of the city\u2019s Metropolitan Stadium.  This facility is where many Colombian soccer matches are played and is popularly called \u201cThe House of Junior\u201d after one of the most famous soccer teams on the northern coast of Colombia.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe idea for Keren\u2019s business came about in 2001.  After her husband passed away, she took beauty and cosmetology classes.  Once she acquired some hands-on experience, she began working at a spa and gained the knowledge to start her own business venture in 2010.  The main customers of her business are friends, referrals, relatives, and office workers.  Each day she strives to improve the quality of the services that she offers.  Even though the level of competition is high, Keren is able to maintain her business by providing a comfortable atmosphere, affordable prices, and friendly service to her customers.  She offers bridal packages, facials, waxing, haircuts, styling, pedicures, and manicures.  Keren has a solid infrastructure in terms of equipment and an inventory of beauty products that enable her to serve her customers efficiently.  At the moment, she is living with her parents.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis Kiva loan is the first form of financing that she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Her goals are to increase her operating capital and to make a few improvements to her establishment so that she can provide better service to her customers.  Keren wants to maintain a cash reserve so that she can buy beauty products for her treatments and to sell for special occasions when people want to improve their physical appearance as well as those of their loved ones.  She takes advantage of these occasions, such as Father\u2019s Day and Valentine\u2019s Day, so that she can maximize her chances of success.  Her greatest wish is to own her location, so she strives each day to attain that goal.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":327.29,"image":{"id":793179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase beauty products and to make improvements to her establishment.

Now her dream is to move into her home and, in the future, turn her business into a large store where she is able to sell all the products that her customers need.  While all this is happening, Lowella takes care to continue maintaining a profitability of no less than 37% and an accounts receivable turnover period of 26 days.  She hopes to make enough money to achieve many of her dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":334.24,"image":{"id":795110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy cards, stationery products, cosmetics and children's clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-21T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lowella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72634},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81546},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83109},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84702},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":86325},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":87980},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":89666},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":91385},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93136},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":94921},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96741},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":107855}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.73},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.6},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.28},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.23},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.22},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.73,"local_amount":72634,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:11Z","rounded_local_amount":73027.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320413,"comment":null},{"amount":45.73,"local_amount":81546,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":81988.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803531,"comment":null},{"amount":94.1,"local_amount":167811,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":168720.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614617,"comment":null},{"amount":53.82,"local_amount":95979,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:27Z","rounded_local_amount":96499.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568570,"comment":null},{"amount":49.44,"local_amount":88165,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:02Z","rounded_local_amount":88642.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188306,"comment":null},{"amount":50.42,"local_amount":89916,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":90403.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324535,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-27T04:46:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":308799,"name":"Olga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olga is an entrepreneur from Kamenka-Dneprovskaya.

There, she has a business called Tienda Aqui Me Quedo (the I'm Staying Here Store) that sells snack food, groceries, drinks, and other general items. Her entrepreneurial idea started with the help of her husband and daughter; he was unemployed and their daughter helped provide start-up capital. Through their disciplined and persistent work, they have grown the business gradually until they were able to turn it into an income stream that covers the family's daily living expenses. Their main challenge is having insufficient working capital to make cash purchases and take advantage of discounts that would increase their margins. This is why they have turned to Kiva for a loan. This first loan through Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo will be used to purchase groceries in volume as well as other miscellaneous items for their store, such as paperclips, stationary, etc. Their greatest goal is to have a freezer for storing meat products so they will be able to respond more quickly to a growing number of neighbors' daily needs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":382.88,"image":{"id":793160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase groceries in volume as well as accessories and stationary","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-21T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Idalides  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75972},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80111},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":81647},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83211},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":84806},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":86432},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":88088},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":89777},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91498},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":93251},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95039},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100168}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.41},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.78},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.47},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.3},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.29},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.41,"local_amount":75972,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:33Z","rounded_local_amount":77491.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673853,"comment":null},{"amount":45.78,"local_amount":80111,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":81713.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320415,"comment":null},{"amount":46.66,"local_amount":81647,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":83279.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803533,"comment":null},{"amount":47.54,"local_amount":83211,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":84875.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614619,"comment":null},{"amount":48.47,"local_amount":84806,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-22T08:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":86502.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568571,"comment":null},{"amount":49.39,"local_amount":86432,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":88160.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779912,"comment":null},{"amount":50.33,"local_amount":88088,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":89849.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188307,"comment":null},{"amount":51.3,"local_amount":89777,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":91572.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324537,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-12T10:03:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":308879,"name":"Kandia Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe  a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 en Mai 2010.

In the San Fernando neighborhood in the city of Cartagena, everyone knows her through her business of selling a variety of merchandise to workers, individuals, housewives, youth, and most especially women, who are her main customers. Sofia caters to them because they are faithful. Her business consists of selling on credit so people can pay her when and where it is possible for them. She is currently getting ready to fill some customers' orders for Fathers' Day, and her working capital is not sufficient for satisfying all the demand. This is why she is realizing that she needs to invest more capital in her business to bring in more customers, and so she has decided to request a Kiva loan. This is the second loan that she will receive from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f2n Mario Sato Domingo. It will be for purchasing men's shoes and clothing because these are the items that are on order and that have helped form her success. She knows the market very well and knows that this is an opportunity for impacting her sales. Sofia lives with her husband and five-year-old son. She dreams of offering her son a better quality of life every day so he can become a professional with opportunities to be successful.

She keeps them in a freezer and sells nearly all of them to order.  This is how she moves her capital.\r\n\r\nSara has been through five loan cycles with Afodenic and has managed to make some improvements to her home and also increase her stock.  She will use this loan to buy a mixed bundle of clothes: two dozen pairs of women's sandals and two dozen men's t-shirts, so that she can continue selling her products, some of which she has orders for.  She hopes to be able to satisfy her customers.  Sara doesn't have many clothes to sell and hopes to achieve better results with this new investment."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":255.14,"image":{"id":795445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy a bundle of clothes, sandals and men's t-shirts, to increase her sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2011-06-21T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.58,"local_amount":852.45,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":885.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226968329,"comment":null},{"amount":29.33,"local_amount":631.8,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:07:41Z","rounded_local_amount":656.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232726993,"comment":null},{"amount":43.45,"local_amount":935.77,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":972.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238530856,"comment":null},{"amount":35.43,"local_amount":763.13,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":792.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244490537,"comment":null},{"amount":35.32,"local_amount":760.81,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:05:23Z","rounded_local_amount":790.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250698802,"comment":null},{"amount":36.55,"local_amount":787.13,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":817.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257102758,"comment":null},{"amount":35.48,"local_amount":764.11,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":793.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263227853,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-28T23:29:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":308905,"name":"Florentina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She is a mother of one daughter and one son. Her husband Mumen (who appears in the picture as she is a conservative woman) is a Palestinian National Authority employee and a transport car driver.\r\n\r\nMumen transports goods in the city where he lives. Afinan took out a loan from FATEN as her husband wants to buy an engine and replace the one in his car as it is not working properly anymore.\r\n\r\nThe loan will help the family have a better income as Mumen will be able to transport more goods and over longer distances. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. \r\n\r\nIn order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee.

In the previous loan year, she never missed a single meeting and paid her installments on time. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady raising her hand is Rozina. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":513.52,"image":{"id":796077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy embroidery materials for embroidery business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2011-06-20T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rozina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sehar Bano ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shazia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":60000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5502},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5502},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5502},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5502},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5502},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":5502},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5502},{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5502},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5502},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5502},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4980}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.19},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.19},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.19},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.19},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.19},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.19},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":64.19,"local_amount":5502,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:17:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221617036,"comment":null},{"amount":64.19,"local_amount":5502,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226986165,"comment":null},{"amount":64.19,"local_amount":5502,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:23:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5507.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232745010,"comment":null},{"amount":64.19,"local_amount":5502,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238549495,"comment":null},{"amount":64.19,"local_amount":5502,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244508292,"comment":null},{"amount":64.19,"local_amount":5502,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250715968,"comment":null},{"amount":64.19,"local_amount":5502,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257118869,"comment":null},{"amount":64.19,"local_amount":5502,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5507.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263243905,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-21T02:57:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":308993,"name":"Rosalinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalinda is 37 years old and married with two adult children.

With the loan, she will buy a new sewing machine which will help her to fulfill the timely orders of her clients because her current machine doesn't produce quality work and takes much time to sew a single dress.   \r\n\r\nShe is confident that an investment in her business will help her grow her business further and improve the financial condition of her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1027.04,"image":{"id":796238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2011-06-21T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bilquis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tahira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khalida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shazia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shakila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raheela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":120000,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":11004},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":11004},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11004},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":11004},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":11004},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":11004},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":11004},{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":11004},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":11004},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":11004},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9960}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.38},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.38},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.38},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.38},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":128.38,"local_amount":11004,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":11016.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221617044,"comment":null},{"amount":128.38,"local_amount":11004,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-18T07:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":11016.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226986173,"comment":null},{"amount":128.38,"local_amount":11004,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":11016.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232745018,"comment":null},{"amount":128.38,"local_amount":11004,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:23:25Z","rounded_local_amount":11016.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238549503,"comment":null},{"amount":128.38,"local_amount":11004,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":11016.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244508300,"comment":null},{"amount":128.38,"local_amount":11004,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":11016.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250715976,"comment":null},{"amount":128.38,"local_amount":11004,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:34:45Z","rounded_local_amount":11016.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257118877,"comment":null},{"amount":128.38,"local_amount":11004,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:35:40Z","rounded_local_amount":11016.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263243913,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-06-26T20:16:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":309076,"name":"Thomas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thomas is a 51-year-old married man, blessed with four children.
