He sells eggs. He has a small farm where he raises hens from the time they are little until they start laying eggs. He says that he cares for them and gives them what they need while they are growing, and then he is rewarded for his work. He is requesting this loan to purchase hens who are already grown, who are ready to start laying eggs. This is so he will recuperate his investment much more quickly since he will immediately sell the eggs. These days there is more demand for eggs since there are many stores and people who buy cartons of eggs. Thanks to God, things have gone well for Milton; he is sure that this loan will help him greatly, since he has so many dreams and projects. He said that his business will prosper even more with this loan and he will have more income so he will be able to achieve his goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":613653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase laying hens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Raymundo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.764722 -90.595556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2010-10-10T19:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milton Eliezer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":507.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396351,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":507.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534906,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":507.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189137557,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1015.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195833581,"comment":null},{"amount":63.14,"local_amount":505.14,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":513.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201276110,"comment":null},{"amount":60.96,"local_amount":487.66,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":495.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211216328,"comment":null},{"amount":125.35,"local_amount":1002.79,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1018.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216494699,"comment":null},{"amount":64.93,"local_amount":519.4,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T07:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":527.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221958317,"comment":null},{"amount":123.12,"local_amount":985.01,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-20T07:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1000.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227659103,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-11T18:30:14Z","paid_date":"2011-09-20T07:54:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":237040,"name":"Maria Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda es una mujer emprendedora, con mucho deseo de seguir trabajando aunque es de edad muy avanzada.

The zone is a part of the Lambayeque province and is located 55 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nCruz provides transportation services for passengers and cargo from his moto-taxi (a modified motorcycle with a passenger compartment added to it).  He covers the Puente El Pavo \u2013 Granja Sasape route every day and offers his service to villagers who travel daily along that route.  Because the number of people who travel on that road is constant and increasing, he can count on a steady customer demand.\r\n\r\nHe also raises and sells small animals and his wife has a small store in their home.  These incomes allow them to move their family ahead financially.\r\n\r\nCruz wants to do maintenance and make some repairs to his moto-taxi, now that it has started to malfunction due to its constant use.  In order to do this, he has seen fit to request his first loan of 1,800 PEN ($650) through Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nCruz is a responsible person, very dedicated to his family.  His greatest desire is to continue to grow as an entrepreneur and provide his family a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":613800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Shaloobu is well educated and works as a geography teacher in the school in Kenesh village. She is known for her strong commitment to education. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, teacher salaries in rural areas are very low. For this reason, in 1990, Shaloobu began to breed farm animals using starting capital of 10,000 KGS. She also began to grow potatoes and clover on her farm. Her ongoing efforts to develop the farm led Shaloobu to obtain her first loan from Bai-Tushum and Partners, which was used as intended and repaid without any delays. Now Shaloobu plans to use this loan of 100,000 KGS to buy eleven sheep, three bull calves, and two colts. With the revenues from the loan, she plans to pay for her son's wedding.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMercedita operates a variety store and does sideline work doing direct selling of clothing, footwear and cosmetics. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling at piece rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of $7 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 18,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products, like groceries, toiletries and beverages, to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nMercedita dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":613979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-10-08T11:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170,"local_amount":7200,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:41Z","rounded_local_amount":7403.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380487,"comment":null},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":6169.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816821,"comment":null},{"amount":113.33,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4935.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652766,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-09T20:18:42Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":237156,"name":"Vandanduger","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vandanduger T. is 31 years old and lives with his wife and one son in Arhangai province, Mongolia, in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent.

is Abraham B., 46, a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite City, Philippines. He is married to Judith B., a storekeeper, and is the father of a college aged young adult and two high-schoolers. By the grace of God, Abraham has managed to support his child's schooling up to the college level. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for his family's every day expenses.\r\n\r\nAbraham operates a variety store and also an egg wholesaling and retailing business. He imports eggs from poultry farms, brings them to the capital and then sells them for a few pesos profit for each egg. Eggs are one of the staples, having a multitude of uses as bread ingredients, viands paired with rice, or as bread fillings.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue his business, he is requesting a loan of 18000 PHP. He will be using the loan to buy more quantities of eggs to be sold and to replenish stocks for his variety store. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his businesses.\r\n  \r\nAbraham hopes that all of his work will enable him to renovate his house soon.

She is married to Erlito Jose B. and mother to four young hard working adults. One is working and helping out with the household finances, while the others are still in college. By the grace of God, Fe has managed to support her children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their every day expenses.\r\n\r\nFe operates a variety store where, during the evenings, she also sells bar-b-qued food. She also does direct selling of frozen cuts of meat and native meat delicacies. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies in wholesale price and selling in piece rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php11, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She will also invest a portion of her loan to buy meat, spices, sauce and firewood for her barbecues. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nFe dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php350 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php14, 000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and newspapers for patterns. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nTaciana dreams that her business will be successful. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":613999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"buy more

It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at a wholesale price and selling by piece rate. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nNenita dreams to be able to renovate her house soon, with all of the work with her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":614006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy more quantities of products such as groceries, toiletries and beverages, to expand her product inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-10-08T14:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nenita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":791.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":3958.35,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4082.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380493,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3166.68,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3266.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816827,"comment":null},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":3958.35,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4082.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652772,"comment":null},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":7916.62,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":8165.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191395930,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-09T22:06:59Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:28:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":237174,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce P.  is currently in the business of selling cooked rice, beans, tea, etc. at her restaurant and she is requesting a loan to stock more food supplies to cook and sell from her restaurant.

She is married to Gregorio A., a driver\/mechanic, and mother to four children, three of whom are in high school while the youngest is currently in elementary. By the grace of God, Aida has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to continually send all of them all the way through college.\r\n\r\nAida oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) and tricycle transportation business. They have long (20-22 person capacity) and short (14-16 person capacity) jeepneys, all of which pay boundary (daily quota) each day. Aida\u2019s husband also drives one of the jeepneys.\r\n \r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and repair the tricycle and jeepney. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nAida dreams of being able to buy another jeepney soon. She also dreams that her children will finish their education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n- Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

WCSL Primary School was founded in 1942 by the Weslyan Mission to help educate the children of Kalangba Chiefdom. Currently, the school is staffed with 21 teachers and 422 pupils. This school is proud of the many doctors, teachers and other professionals that have passed through it.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that this school has applied for from SMT\/Kiva lenders. Daniel M. M. is their leader and headmaster at the school. Daniel, age 53, was born in Kalangba village and has been in the teaching profession for 35 years now. He is married and has nine children: four in secondary school, three in college and the rest are now grown-ups and living on their own accord. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. With the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers repay their loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nMr. M., leader of this group, has requested this loan in order to pay for the school charges of his children.\r\n\r\nIncluded in this photo is loan officer Mary Y.

He aims for a prosperous future for them, and does his best to achieve this goal. After graduating from Agricultural college, for four years, he has sold jeans at the market in the capital city Bishkek, where he met Sablat, his wife. They decided to move to Tokmok city, near the capital, and settle there. This couple went through hard times, with the lack of a home and money, but didn\u2019t give up.\r\n\r\nSablat, in order to support her family, began to sew Kyrgyz national traditional clothes \u2013 \u201cchapan\u201d and \u201cchepken\u201d and embroider them with ornamental patterns. This activity started to bring permanent profit and customers increased. It led Adilbek to master the profession of seamstress - he bought one more sewing machine and helped his wife in this business. They worked hard and managed to enlarge it through raising floating capital, purchasing additional equipment, and hiring workers. With the revenues from these activities, Adilbek bought a small flat for his family and a used car.\r\n\r\nNow Adilbek wants to take a loan of 70,000 KGS to purchase fabrics and thread and expand the range of products in his shop. He hopes that this will help him to increase revenues.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

N. was born in1969, she is married to Thomas Ngang and they are blessed with five children, amongst which two are below the age of fifteen. They live in a house made of five rooms and two persons occupy a room. She lives in Ntangang a quarter in Bamenda North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nChristina N. has faced some challenges in life. The most terrifying thing that happened in her life has been the issue of accidents and death of her family members. Poverty has been her major difficulty in life, and the inability to raise capital for business projects. She plans to invest this loan in a house rental business. With this loan she plans to improve the living standard of her family with the proceeds from the investment. She believes the business will succeed because she has been in the business for a long time. She thinks the pressing needs of housing by inhabitants of the locality and students coming to studying in the locality will be an outstanding factor for the success of the business. The structure will be styled beautifully and hence will attract potential tenants, and subsequently lead to the success of her business. The loan will help her community because they will be able to accommodate families and visitors to the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nChristina N. will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to expand her business and save for rainy days. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":783.47,"image":{"id":614094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"To build a house for rental.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

He is married to Odette Nyonga and they are blessed with three children and all are below the age of 15 years old. He and the family live in a small house of three rooms. He lives in Nitop III, a quarter in Bamenda North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nAdolf has faced some challenges in life. Amongst which are the inability to meet the basic necessities of his family, like clothing, feeding, transportation and educating himself and his children. It is difficult to raise capital to start up a small business that will sustain him and his family. He plans to invest this loan in a transport business, by buying a motorbike for transporting people and goods from one place to another. He believes the business will succeed because the previous loan he took was repaid by the income raised from an old bike of his, therefore he concludes that he is sure the business will succeed. He is certain that this business will succeed because the roads around the area of residence are poor, therefore the bike is a paramount way of transportation. The loan will help his community because they will be able to afford a considerable means of transport at cheaper fares. \r\n\r\nAdolf will plough back his profit into his business and use part to care for his family. He also will use the proceeds to pay his children\u2019s school fees and cater for the family. He prefers GHAPE because of the training he frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":614101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

On the other hand, she likes this one because it is very well-organized and the members are highly supportive of one other.

El problema m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil que enfrenta es que no tiene una vivienda propia, y los directivos de la escuela le dieron permiso para que construyera una habitaci\u00f3n dentro de las instalaciones de la misma y gracias a los pr\u00e9stamos obtenidos en FAMA pudo hacerlo aunque es muy peque\u00f1a para su familia. Su reto es ahorrar aunque sea de poco en poco para comprar un solar y poder construir su casa, seguir manteniendo a su familia porque hace dos a\u00f1os su esposo muri\u00f3 y no tiene ning\u00fan otro soporte econ\u00f3mico. Elbia solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar papas, chiles, cebollas, zanahorias, pataste, repollo, etc. y as\u00ed ofrecer una mayor variedad de productos a sus clientes. Una de sus ventajas es que su hijo mayor le ayuda a transportar en una carreta las verduras desde su casa al mayoreo y no tiene que pagar transporte ni empleado porque \u00e9l tambi\u00e9n le ayuda a atender a los clientes. Con el apoyo del pr\u00e9stamo espera obtener mejores ganancias para ahorrar un poco, seguir llevando el alimento a su casa y seguir pagando el estudio de sus cuatro hijos menores. Su sue\u00f1o es tener tambi\u00e9n un puesto de venta de ropa para contar con otra entrada de dinero y as\u00ed poder empezar a construir su casa, y graduar a sus hijos. Elbia se siente muy agradecida porque con el financiamiento obtenido en FAMA ha podido mejorar sus condiciones econ\u00f3micas y de antemano se siente agradecida con todas las personas que invertir\u00e1n en ella a trav\u00e9s del pr\u00e9stamo.","en":"The \u201cResidenciales El Campo #2\u201d (El Campo Residences #2) group consists of three members who do different economic activities.\n\nMrs. Elbia, 51, is one of the members.  She\u2019s a widow and has five children.  From Monday to Friday she has a steady job working as a Cleaning Lady and on weekends she sells vegetables.\n\nThe greatest obstacle she faces is not owning her own home and the school administrators gave her permission to build a room on the school grounds.  Thanks to FEMA loans she was able to do so although it is too small for her family.\n\nHer challenge now is to save up, even if just bit by bit, to buy a piece of property on which to build her house and to continue supporting her family because her husband died two years ago and she has no other source of income.\n\nElbia is requesting funds to buy potatoes, chilies, onions, carrots, chayote, cabbage, etc. in order to have a wider variety available for her customers.\nAn advantage she has is that her oldest son helps her move the vegetables from home to the wholesale market with a cart so she doesn\u2019t have to pay transport costs nor hire an employee since he helps her tend to customers too.\n\nWith support from the loan she hopes to earn better profits so that she can start to have some savings, continue to bring food home and pay for her four youngest children\u2019s education.  Her dream is to also have a stand to sell clothing to have a second source of income and start to build her house and have her children graduate.\n\nElbia is very grateful because financing from FEMA has helped her improve her economic conditions and she would like to thank everyone ahead of time who will invest in her through the loan.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":611717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2010-10-12T18:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reina Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Blacina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elbia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":17000,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50.98,"local_amount":963,"processed_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":963.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396170,"comment":null},{"amount":28.43,"local_amount":537,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":537.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396171,"comment":null},{"amount":564.71,"local_amount":10666.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-09T11:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10670.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534731,"comment":null},{"amount":125.49,"local_amount":2370.32,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2371.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189137403,"comment":null},{"amount":130.39,"local_amount":2463.01,"processed_date":"2011-02-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2463.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414839,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-13T02:49:27Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":237310,"name":"Shirley","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shirley Q. is 44 years old, married and has five adult-aged children.

First she started out selling Yanbal brand beauty products and perfumes.  However, noting that this did not produce income sufficient to meet her needs she decided to sell shoes and ladies clothes.  This is what she is currently selling.  She works every day from 8am until 11am and again from 3pm until 5pm because she also has to tend to her home and children.

Her children are in school but when they have free time they help her tend to the store while she does household chores.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for funding to stock the store with items like: lard, rice, beans, sugar, cooking oil, condiments, sauces, noodles, bread, churros (fried dough), beverages, dairy products, meats, sausages, etc.\r\n\r\nThe only problem she is currently facing is a drop in sales but she hopes this situation will improve.  With financial help she has the possibility of improving her store\u2019s appearance to make it more attractive to customers thereby becoming the best one in her community.  This is her first cycle with FAMA.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":613875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy general groceries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Francisco de la Paz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2010-10-12T19:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amparo Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":14000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.34},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":2333.3,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:44:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2361.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396179,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":2333.34,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-09T11:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2361.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534732,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":2333.34,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2361.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414814,"comment":null},{"amount":214.29,"local_amount":4000.01,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-21T08:06:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4048.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195833434,"comment":null},{"amount":160.71,"local_amount":3000.01,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-05T08:05:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3036.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275979,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T07:13:51Z","paid_date":"2011-05-05T08:05:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":237315,"name":"Michelle Joy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Michelle Joy A., from the village of Lurugan, Valencia City, Bukidnon, is 22 years old, married, and has one infant-aged children.

While she tends to the business three of her children attend school.\r\n\r\nWith the obtained financing she will be able to stock both her businesses with a greater variety of products.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties she faces is her house\u2019s location because it\u2019s a bit hidden so she can\u2019t display her merchandise very well.\r\n\r\nWith help from the loan she hopes to continue to help her husband support the household and save up to rent a place that\u2019s better situated.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her children grow up healthy and that they become persons who contribute to building a better society.\r\n\r\nThis is her 3rd FEMA cycle.  With loans received she has been able to gradually improve her economic life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":613878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy clothes and groceries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Francisco de la Paz","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2010-10-12T19:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Gelsamina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396180,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-11T11:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534733,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414815,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-21T08:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2519.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195833435,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-02T08:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2519.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206143296,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-29T07:51:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211216240,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221657974,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227307926,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784906,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:53:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589302,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T15:58:25Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:53:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":237321,"name":"Carmelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmelita L. is from the village of Poblacion, Quezon, Bukidnon.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nMiguela is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her oldest son, 17, is a student and works and studies in Kazakhstan while her youngest son, 16, attends a local high school. Her husband works in a construction company. Bulbul operates a clothing retail trading business in her town. She used to work as a clothing salesperson where she sold other people's clothes and received a salary. Based on her experience, she started her own business in a rented stall at the Hurd trade center in 2008. She is planning to expand her business and import more clothing items from Erlian, a border city in China. She wants to open her own shop when her business reaches a sustainable level. Her earnings have enabled her to buy a new house after selling her old one. Bulbul is a very modest and hardworking woman and says, \" All I want is to continue operating my business with success and provide for my children's education. \" She is requesting a 3,000,000 MNT

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

R., 44, is the loving mother of four children. For more than 17 years, Munavvar has sold fish in the central fish market of the city. When she started she had only 100 US dollars in turnover. With time, her business expanded and today it is quite stable. Munavvar requests 2200 US dollars. She wants to purchase fish at wholesale prices in order to have stock for selling during coming celebrations when fishing is prohibited. Munavvar has already been provided loans by IMON and has shown herself as a reliable client. She would like to thank everyone for supporting her.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Currently, the school is staffed with eight teachers and has 400 pupils. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that this school has applied for from SMT\/Kiva lenders. Michael M.W. D.

With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nMr. D., leader of this group, has requested this loan in order to construct a dwelling for his family. \u201cThis loan will ease some of my difficulties,\u201d said Mr. D., \u201cand will be a great development aid for my family,\u201d he concluded. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":614704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Buy house-building materials for the construction of a family home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Feredugu","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2010-10-11T14:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Michael M.w.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frank","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moiwo Andrew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Unisa B.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5750000,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":575000},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":575000},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":575000},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":575000},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":575000},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":575000},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":575000},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":575000},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":575000},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":575000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":145,"local_amount":575000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":575650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177470994,"comment":null},{"amount":145,"local_amount":575000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":575650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182608875,"comment":null},{"amount":145,"local_amount":575000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":575650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188747805,"comment":null},{"amount":145,"local_amount":575000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":575650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191486019,"comment":null},{"amount":145,"local_amount":575000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":575650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195912886,"comment":null},{"amount":144.87,"local_amount":574500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-20T08:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":575149.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201952927,"comment":null},{"amount":145,"local_amount":575000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-18T07:58:56Z","rounded_local_amount":575650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206572329,"comment":null},{"amount":290.08,"local_amount":1150300,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:58:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1151600.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211297036,"comment":null},{"amount":145.05,"local_amount":575000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-20T08:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":575650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217134385,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T15:40:00Z","paid_date":"2011-07-20T08:01:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":237494,"name":"Madinahon's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Madinahon A. is the leader of the group.
