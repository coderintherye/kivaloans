was in May 1994 that Michelle E. and her husband started a small hatchery business. They can still remember the time when they were making \u201cbalut\u201d(egg delicacy) themselves, never worrying about the risk of biking at night, to sell their eggs for income for their family. Every day, they toil away because they like to earn enough to have savings to add to their capital. They also ensure good quality of their product and services to please their customers and sustain their business. Their experiences are really a mixture of perseverance, hard work and prayer that they continuously do until today.<P>\r\n\r\nPresently, the couple are the proprietors of the largest \u201cBalut\u201d and hatchery business in Sto. Nino, South Cotabato, Mindanao. \u201c Balut\u201d is a very popular delicacy in the Philippines. It is made of duck and chicken eggs. Making the eggs as their business, the couple is sure that they will have a stable income their family will enjoy. <P>\r\n\r\nAiming for business growth to support their child's education, the couple finally joined the credit program of Community Economic Ventures, Inc.  Their participation in the program was an opportunity to learn about savings and business management. During cluster meetings, they were able to market and talk about their product to other entrepreneurs who were also accessing  CEVI credit services. The couple markets their eggs as well as their ducklings, always for sale.<P>\r\n\r\nOver years of business development, their loan of Php 4,000 from CEVI has gone far in acquiring business assets.  Seventy percent of their income is reinvested in the business and the rest goes to savings.<P>\r\n\r\n\u201cSome of our competitors have tried destroying us as well as our business.  They are after our regular customers. Good that they never succeeded. God has helped us survive and stay in the market for so many years now. We are doing our best to make our business grow even more. In that way we would be able to employ more people in our business,\u201d they said.\r\n\r\nThe business has now reached Davao and General Santos (still part of Mindanao). They opened an outlet in these cities, hoping that more and more \u201cBalut vendors\u201d will be able to benefit from their high quality but less expensive eggs. Surprisingly, their business has turned everyone on to sell eggs in the streets to have a livelihood for their children. <P>\r\n\r\nAside from the hatchery business, they have now started distributing fashion products. This business also helps them supplement their income. They hope that like their hatchery business, their engagement in fashion retail will also be a success.<P>\r\n\r\n Until now, the couple continues to access loans through the CEVI credit program.  They like the services of CEVI because they also teach people with businesses moral standards and Christian faith. The couple believes in God, who is the center of their business success. They believe that God will always bless the works of the faithful. And with all accomplishments and compliments they receive, they will remain humble and continue to help their community, especially those who seek their aid.<P>\r\n\r\nHaving learned about KIVA from CEVI, Michelle E. would like to borrow Php 25,000. She will use the loan to improve their business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":357981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

H. is from the village of Militar, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 49 years old. Terisita is married and has 2 adult children. To make a living, Terisita owns and operates a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Terisita has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2008, Terisita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Terisita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Terisita is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Terisita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:<P>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a 40 year old woman married to Maleno, a laborer, and they have four children ranging in age from 14-9. They live in a rural but very beautiful village of Hamtic in the Antique province in the Philippines. She has had her business since 2005 of selling vegetables in her village, but it was hard to gain extra capital to buy more goods and be able to increase her profit.\r\n\r\nWith this loan from ASHI of 12,000 Pesos, she will be able to buy a larger quantity of vegetables and also is going to buy a few small piglets for pig fattening, a popular business here. She will buy them seed, supplements and vitamins and sell them after about six months when they are ready to go to market.\r\n\r\nHer greatest hope is to rise out of poverty. With more of her vegetables in production and this extra source of income from the hogs, she believes she will be able to save money to send her kids to school and hopefully one day college.\r\n\r\nWritten by Sloane Berrent, Kiva

S. is from the town of Aloran.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Dominga has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Dominga joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Dominga has successfully repaid a previous loan  from PMPC. Dominga is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 13th loan taken out by Dominga from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Teodora has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, Teodora joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teodora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Teodora is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Teodora from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Anecita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Anecita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anecita has successfully repaid a previous loan  from PMPC. Anecita is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase a fishing boat. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Anecita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Arlene has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Arlene joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arlene has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,500 PHP from PMPC. Arlene is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to fully pay for a motorcycle as a means of transportation, which aids their present business. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Arlene from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

is a 44-year-old woman married to Ethlebert, a laborer, and they have eight children ranging in age from 22-4 years old. They live in Pandan, a beautiful coastal town in the north of Antique province. When she started her business three years ago, it was just a small capital to buy and sell rice for consumption. With every loan, she is able to expand just a little bit more. With this loan of 22,000 Pesos, she is going to buy 60 sacks of rice to sell in smaller quantities. She is going to buy two piglets and the feed and vitamins they need to go strong and fat and be ready for market.\n\nOn the side, she has also started a manicure business where she goes to her neighbors to give them manicures and pedicures. This is good for her and her family because if the weather is bad or typhoons hit, she has more than one way to keep an income.\n\nHer hope is to be able to save enough to help all of her children finish school. She's like to help her husband open a store of his own and hopefully one day build a big enough house for all her children to be able to live there to.

P. is from the village of Kiburiao, Quezon Bukidnon. He is 43 years old. Hilario is married and has school-aged children. To make a living, Hilario owns and operates a business running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Hilario has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.(Hilario was out of town during the picture taking, so we let his wife represent him, being a partner in their business.)\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Hilario joined HSPFI to have access to financial services. As to their previous loan, Helario and his wife are both happy and thankful for all the Kiva lenders who provide financial support. With this support, their business is growing and making more progress than before. They are hopeful that lenders may continue to finance their business activities. They have just ended their previous loan amounting to PHP 20,000. Hilario is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 15th loan taken out by Hilario from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement income of the family, educational expenses of the children and savings for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":358031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Precilla has been engaged in her business for over 18 years and earns approximately 1000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Precilla joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Precilla has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Precilla is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Precilla from HSPFI.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He and his family live in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Zafar started his own small venture after his relatives suggested he should try his luck as a market vendor. Today Zafar runs a small business selling junior clothing, primarily selling to teens and young people. His vending facility has a very favorable location and offers a large assortment of merchandise, and this attracts many customers. \r\n<p>\r\nZafar believes that financial support from IMON International has helped him boost his sales and grow his business. He would like a loan of 5,000 Somoni to purchase inventory wholesale. Zafar believes this loan will help him further develop his business and get additional income to improve his family\u2019s living standards. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable.

She is 39 years old and the mother of 5 children with ages between 8 and 23 years old.  All of them are in school.  Maria stopped her schooling in the 9th grade due to an early pregnancy.\n\nShe lives with her husband and 5 children in their own home.  She grew up with her parents, but she lost her mother in 1980 when she was still a child.  She went to school and did small businesses for 5 years and married in 1990.  She began her business of selling chickens and eggs 9 years later, and currently she sells home goods.\n\nShe has been the owner of the business since 1990 and learned without any employees.  As a reference, she basically sells juices, milk, corn, and coffee.  She acquires them in South Africa (for example, 1 box of milk costs 110MT and sells for 420MT).\n\nShe has monthly receipts of 10,000MT.  She has never had any loans with other banks that operate in the district.  She heard of Hluvuku-Adsema through friends and took the first loan in the amount of 16,000MT for the purchase of merchandise.  With credit of 20,000MT she intends to strengthen her business.  She has future plans to expand the business to other zones and purchase a second car to facilitate the transportation.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

In 1979 she married her husband with whom she lives today.  She began her commercial activities 10 years ago selling various products in a small establishment that opens from 8:00am to 10:00pm.  She works without any employees.\r\n\r\nShe learned the business from her mother more than 15 years ago.  Her best products are eggs which she acquires for 190MT and sells for 255MT per box.  She earns 1,200MT monthly.  She came to know about Hluvuku-Adsema through a friend in the neighborhood.  She has never requested a loan from another bank, and this is her first loan with this institution.\r\n\r\nThis loan is 15,000MT and she intends to use it to increase the volume of her business and earn more sales.

As a group, they are requesting a loan of 5,800 Nuevos Soles, which each will invest in her business.  The women of \u201cMujeres Hacia Adelante\u201d dedicate themselves to a variety of business ventures, including selling new and used clothing, candy, snow cones, beauty products, CDs and DVDs of films or music videos, plantain chips and cooked food.

She is saving her earnings to be able to buy a vehicle.  That way she can transport her merchandise.\r\n\r\nCelsa has five children.  She sells grains.  She started out buying door to door.  Now she has the grains ground and sells from fair to fair.  Her business has been increasing since she started with her loans.  They have helped her a lot; they have changed the quality of her and her children\u2019s lives.  With her savings she is thinking of opening a mini market where she can sell her products.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":358426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"Invest in their businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-07-25T18:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liduvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Genoveva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celsa Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fortunata Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Domitila Elecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jonatan Israel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herlinda Haydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.68},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.68},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.68},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.68},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.68},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":387.51},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.51},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":387.61,"local_amount":1167,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1176.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73597011,"comment":null},{"amount":387.4,"local_amount":1166.36,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:47:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1175.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87032406,"comment":null},{"amount":387.5,"local_amount":1166.68,"processed_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T20:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1176.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96944677,"comment":null},{"amount":387.6,"local_amount":1166.96,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-30T09:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1176.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103786616,"comment":null},{"amount":387.41,"local_amount":1166.4,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1175.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110677228,"comment":null},{"amount":387.48,"local_amount":1166.6,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-17T09:38:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1175.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110677229,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-26T18:32:11Z","paid_date":"2010-01-17T09:38:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":124888,"name":"Yenni","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yenni es socia del Banco Comunal Nobleza. \nYenni es conviviente, tiene 30 a\u00f1os y 1 hijo, Yenni tiene una tienda en su casa en donde vende abarrotes en general, verduras, carnes, actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas.

She saw that she needed to earn her own income as a way of supporting her husband, who is a mason, with the education of their children. Together they have succeeded in improving their pig farm and now have approximately 70 pigs.  They also raise ducks and chickens, as well as maintain a fruit orchard.

She lives in her parents' house along with her husband, Rodolfo, who is 20.  Her daughter Jennifer is 5-years-old, and Yeny wants to give her a good future.  Her business is located in Ananea (in the district of Juliaca).  She sells stuffed animals, which she obtains in the San Jos\u00e9 market in Juliaca.  Her business is very frequented and she always greets her customers with a friendly smile.  She enjoys chatting with her customers and advising them about the loveliest stuffed animal to buy.  She has had this business for 2 years, and it is going very well for her, but she still doesn't feel accomplished.  She thinks the most difficult part of her job is tolerating the intense cold in Ananea since it is very close to the mountains.  In the near future, she wants to have a bigger store where she can attend to her clients more peacefully.

Anahaw, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 and is Member No. 05 of Group No. 351 of Center 56 in Hinigaran, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nLike many people in the seaside town of Hinigaran, Josephine and her husband have been growing oysters for sale and also maintain a small fishpen for the last 29 years. Since oyster and fish farming are very erratic sources of income, Josephine's husband earns a daily income by shuttling local passengers around town on his \"tricycle\" -- a motorcycle with a sidecar attached for passengers. Josephine and her husband earn an average of PHP 7,000.00 or about $187 per month from their oyster culture and fish pen business.\r\n\r\nShe is taking this PHP 18,000 loan to do repair and maintenance work on her small fish pen so that it could efficiently catch and trap the fish for a more bountiful harvest. This is Josephine's 13th loan cycle at NWTF- Project Dungganon, and she has always paid her loan on time and without any problems. The additional capital will help her and her family increase their income potential and make life a little more comfortable for Josephine and her husband especially now that they have reached midlife.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":358268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

G. is from the city of Dapitan. She is 51 years old. Estrella is widowed and has three adult children. To make a living, Estrella owns & operates a food stall selling a variety of fruits in the local community. Estrella has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Estrella joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Estrella has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Estrella is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Estrella from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Aileen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock to raise & sell in the future. Aileen is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Aileen from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Rasul is a hardworking man who actively contributes to the well-being of his family by selling plant oil in the market. Married with two adult children, Rasul spends many hours at his small stand in the market waiting for his customers. In the traditional Tajik cuisine, the majority of meals are fried or cooked using cottonseed oil.  Our national dish, \u201cPilaw,\u201d needs a great deal of cottonseed oil in order to be delicious. The goods sold by Rasul are in popular demand among the population, so he realizes that with the excellent quality and customer service he gives, he can grow his business. For this reason he is requesting a loan of $2200.  Rasul is counting on your help and thanks you for your support.   <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Munira is 40 years old. She is married and has two children. Munira works cultivating a small farm, which she has done for more than 17 years. She grows different types of vegetables such as beans, onions, and carrots. Every day she gets up very early to work on her land. Munira drives to the produce market in the capital to sell her products, while her son takes care of the daily work on the farm. Munira is very proud of the work she has done together with her beloved son, and grateful that they have been able to acquire the comforts they have in their home. They have made good use of their previous loans. Munira is applying for a loan to IMON International for the fourth time. The loan will be used to buy fertilizer, seeds and insecticides that they need for their farm.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sojida is 42 years old. She is married and has five children. Her husband is currently unemployed. That is why Sojida is the only breadwinner in her family. Sojida sells dried apricots in the central local market. As a rule, she purchases apricots in the market and dries them by herself. She has been in this business for 30 years already. Dried fruit, especially dried apricot, is very popular in Tajikistan. Besides, it is very useful for the health. Considering the constant demand for this kind of goods, the business of Sojida is quite successful and brings a stable income for the family. Today Sojida requests 3000 Somoni.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her sewing business has been the main source of income for her family for the past 6 years, and earns about PHP 5,000.00  (approx. $104) per month, which she frugally budgets to fit the needs of her young family.\r\n\r\nFor her 16th loan cycle with NWTF-Project Dungganon, she is borrowing PHP 15,000.00 so that she could purchase more clothing materials and sewing supplies to make more clothes to sell to her customers in her community. \r\n\r\nSince she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999, the profits from her business has slowly enabled her to improve their house from a bamboo and nipa hut to a more permanent structure with concrete materials. She has also been setting aside some of her profits in preparation for the college education of her children who are now 13, 15 and 18 years of age.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":358769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"the purchase

Haguimit, La Carlota City. For years, she and her family lived in house made of bamboo with Nipa (palm leaves) for roofing. Her family lived a hand-to-mouth existence: her husband worked in the sugarcane fields of the sugarcane plantation where they lived. During off-season, she and her husband made charcoal to sell. Since she had some knowledge in hairstyling and sewing she supplemented their income by doing odd haircuts and curls, and some sewing on the side. With their determination to move out of poverty, they were able to send all 5 of their children to finish High School.\r\n\r\nAlicia joined NWTF- Project Dungganon in October 2002. She used her first loan to put up a small general store, and raised pigs to sell. Later, she and her husband were able to rent a 5-hectare land where they planted sugarcane and rice.  Subsequent loan cycles also enabled her to purchase a carabao and other equipment that they used in their farming ventures. With the profits from farming and her general store she was able to build a concrete house for her family. With  more stable sources of income, she was able to send her 2 youngest children to college until both graduated, but they are currently unemployed and are helping their parents in their business ventures. \r\n\r\nAt present Mrs. Alicia is on her 10th Loan Cycle with a loan of PHP 20,000.00. She needs this additional capital to help her purchase additional goods to resell  in her general store.\r\n\r\nIt is Mrs. Alicia's greatest dream to help her children improve their status in life, and continue breaking the cycle of poverty that she and her husband started in the family by the sweat of their brow.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

Mrs. Phalla T. is the village bank president who has been selected by the other members.\r\n\r\nMrs. Phalla T. is 49 years old and the mother of five children, one of whom is employed in a garment factory while the others are enrolled in the local school. Mrs. Phalla T. is a farmer who owns 1.5-hectare (3.75-acre) field of land on which she cultivates rice to earn for living. She is also a dried-fish seller in the local market. Her husband, Mr. Bo Sorn, is a teacher in the local school. \r\n\r\nSince her business is doing well, Mrs. Phalla T. wants to expand it by purchasing more dried fish to re-sell to earn more profits for her family. \r\n\r\nTwo members in this group loan have end-of-term (EoT) loans and the rest have monthly-payment loans. Those with EOT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

Their desire is the progress of their family. For a year she has been selling shoes for both women and men. She sells the merchandise by going house to house in different areas of her town. She sells on credit or for cash, according to what she agrees on with her customers. It is very important to her to treat her customers well because that determines if they will buy from her again. Additionally, she likes getting to know the different places in her city, since before she worked she didn\u2019t go out of her house a lot and there are many beautiful places in her region that have amazed her. She has made good earnings with her business, and she also counts on the support of her husband, who helps her with sales when he is available, increasing her income.

Her plans are to be able to finish making her house and to give an education to her three children.\r\n\r\nShe works in domestic services.  It is exhausting work, but she has to work to be able to help her family.  With this loan she will buy construction materials to raise her house, which is half stone and the rest wood.  She will do this to be able to live in better conditions with her children.  \r\n\r\nHer house is made of very old zinc sheeting, and it is very rusty.  That is why she wants to make the improvements now.  It is difficult for her to be the only one working.  She is grateful to the institution for the benefits of improving her home.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":358915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Buy construction materials to make improvements on her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-08-02T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damarys Johanna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":679.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86965286,"comment":null},{"amount":44.18,"local_amount":883.63,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":901.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875739,"comment":null},{"amount":22.49,"local_amount":449.71,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":458.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713663,"comment":null},{"amount":39.85,"local_amount":796.94,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":812.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601353,"comment":null},{"amount":28.79,"local_amount":575.73,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":587.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118002813,"comment":null},{"amount":39.65,"local_amount":792.98,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":808.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123840969,"comment":null},{"amount":107.43,"local_amount":2148.62,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2191.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128873884,"comment":null},{"amount":84.28,"local_amount":1685.72,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1719.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639293,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-03T23:53:27Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":125133,"name":"Kathegbeh Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Umu J., Mummy C. and Umaru K..

She is a married mother of three children. All her children are in school in the community where they live. She and her husband and children live together. She works hard to provide food and school fees for the children. She is a qualified teA. and this has given her the opportunity to understand the importance of education. She is providing all educational support to the children. In spite of the challenges she faces, she has been a baker for 12 years. Using flour for her production, she prepares bread and sells it to her customers. She supplies bread by herself in the market center to her customers. And people also come to her to buy. Her only problem now has to do with adequate funds to buy raw materials as prices are going up.
