She sells condiments, mixed cereals, traditional beverages commonly known as \"Sodabi\", bags of charcoal, and food products. All of these items are displayed at her house. At the same time, she also runs a food preparation business, which allows her to raise the level of her sales.\n\nShe gets her supplies at the international market in Benin and at the Cococodji market, which is situated west of Cotonou, the economic capital.

She lives with her husband and children in their own house.  She has worked in the fields all her life; her parents taught her to do this work, which, over time, she has made into her principal source of income.  In addition, she and her husband keep bees.  They have a bee farm, where at certain times of year they extract honey to sell.   This occurs in the spring, when they collect nearly 40 liters of honey, and in the winter, when the production is a scant 15 liters or so.  They grow barley, wheat, corn, and potatoes, most of which they sell at the local market.  She enjoys what she does, since it is her way of generating a stable source of income, which for many years has helped her to sustain her family.

comes from village Rokiti, West Georgia. He is 44 years old and lives with his wife Tamila and 4-year-old daughter, Ani. Goderdzi works in local shop as a worker producing doors and windows. Along with his main job, he is leading the agricultural business of the family. In particular, the family has a small pig farm with 1 pig. They sell piglets in the village. Goderdzi also owns small plot of land where maize is grown. Harvested corn is used on the farm for feeding the pig and piglets. Though Goderdzi and Tamila work hard, their income is still very low and the family is still regarded as living below the poverty line. For this reason, they get social assistance from the state. Total average monthly income of the family, including government\u2019s assistance, is 570 GEL. \r\n\r\nGoderdzi requested credit for 2 purposes.

He has the will to get ahead and to improve.  \r\n\r\nThat is why four years ago he was motivated to also raise guinea pigs.  His wife helps him work day to day taking care of these animals.  Now they can see, with satisfaction, the fruit of their labor.  Their guinea pigs have grown in number.  This gives then a great advantage in selling them and for their income.\r\n\r\nWhen it is the season for sowing and harvesting, their children take charge of the job.  His plan is to continue working until he has no more strength.  He is one of the founding members of his communal bank.  He is totally satisfied because his group has been functioning for ten years with members who are punctual with their payments.  \r\n\r\nThat is why he continues to be motivated to continue accessing loans that he always uses for the agricultural work that he does.  He will use the requested loan to buy sacks of fertilizer and a better breed of guinea pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":812429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sacks of fertilizer and a better breed of guinea pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-17T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2056.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385395,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-18T16:25:54Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":316256,"name":"Dora Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Dora Luz es una mujer trabajadora y emprendedora de 65 a\u00f1os quien tiene un peque\u00f1o y modesto comedor desde hace 10 a\u00f1os en Ticuantepe.

Ainura is a highly experienced cook in one of the small cafes in the  town of Tup. She and her husband have two high school age children who depend on their parents financially. Her husband works as a construction worker in order to attain improvements in the economic state of the family.  Ainura has faced difficulties at her work due to an increasing slump in average income of the town residents. This has lessened the  demand for services including restaurant service. Two years ago a considerable portion of family capital was invested in a new business start up. 7 000 soms were used for the purchase of a young calf for fattening and reselling. A monthly profit of 3 000 soms made it possible for her to make home improvements and construct a shed for livestock. Ainura has applied for a loan from Kiva with the purpose of purchasing three head of livestock for further fattening and reselling. In the future, Ainura hopes to help her children get  college education. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\t\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n MBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Five years is the amount of time he has been diligently bearing a hand in this business venture that he began with savings from his previous teaching job. Joushua is happily married with two children who are all in school and doing well. \r\n\r\nA restaurant business cannot go wrong if one has a steady working capital base. This means that individuals operating that business will be in a position to restock the business every time the restaurant runs short on food.\r\n\r\nWith the current status quo where food prices are rising day in, day out, a person involved in this enterprise may fail to sustain it without a robust capital base. Joushua says this is not likely to happen in his business as he has quite a sufficient working capital. Not so big, he says, but at least strong enough to ensure he remains in business. It's just that he has other business operational expenses, which at times constrain his capital base and make it hard for him to make enough food purchases.\r\n \r\nThis business generates 18,000 Ugandan shillings weekly in sales revenue. This is quite paltry given the fact that food prices are up and most restaurant owners are increasing their food prices. Though his weekly sales revenue is minimal, he is not one to get disconsolate. He reckons he will be able to make sales income once he can get this loan to improve operations at his business. This Kiva loan, he says, is to aid him in the purchase of more food for his restaurant.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":812783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase more food for his restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Jinja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.583333 33.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-16T00:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joushua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faizal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4800000,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000},{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":462.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1204812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227248977,"comment":null},{"amount":925,"local_amount":2400000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-04T09:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2409625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868547,"comment":null},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1204812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648381,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-16T14:48:48Z","paid_date":"2012-01-06T09:23:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":316379,"name":"Abed El Hussein","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abed El Hussein is 32 years old, married, and the father of two precious children: Hassan, a 3 year-old boy, and Mona, a 9-month-old girl.

is a 44-year-old single mother of 2 children, aged 17 and 23. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 20 years in her hometown in eastern Kenya. Her farm currently produces milk, potatoes and cabbages, which she sells to the local market. She depends solely on the income from her farm to provide for her family's basic needs.\r\n\r\nJane has requested a loan of 36,400 KES in order to purchase and insure a dairy cow. She says that this loan will enable her to acquire a quality cow that will produce enough milk for domestic consumption and sale. The extra income from the sale of milk will be used to pay her child's school fees. Jane's biggest challenges have been insufficient water for irrigation and poor weather conditions. She plans to buy 4 quality dairy cows and expand her farming project from half an acre to one acre in the next 5 years."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":237.97,"image":{"id":812837,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

As a rule, Akpar purchases small cattle in the central market, feeds them and then resells them at higher prices in the local market. \r\n\r\nBeing in this business for 12 years, he knows very well how to choose the animals, how to breed them and look after them. Thus, he gets up every morning in order to feed the animals and to look after them. His knowledge and skills allow him to make his business successful and generate a stable and considerable income for his large family. \r\n\r\nAkpar is planning to enlarge the stock and to purchase more cattle. With this purpose, he requests 2,500 USD that he will spend for the purchase of young cattle and sheep.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a hardworking man. He is married and the responsible father of two children. His wife is not working. \n\nFor more than three years Najmiddin has been running a public transportation service. He has his own car, a \u201cGazelle,\u201d that he drives through Isfara city. The profit that he makes from this business he spends to provide for his family\u2019s needs. \n\nIn addition to his transportation business he also processes dried fruits. Najmiddin would like to get a loan of 10,000 TJS for purchasing of new car in order to expand his business and make a good profit. \n\nThis loan will be his second loan from IMON International and he has a good credit history.\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

is an entrepreneur from Istaravshan. She lives there with her husband and two children. \r\n\r\nNoroy sells children's clothing. All the merchandise she offers for sale in her business is trademark quality at affordable prices. \r\n\r\nWhen Noroy launched her enterprise 20 years ago, it was pretty basic. However, she has consistently increased her clientele and the assortment of discount clothing imported from neighboring cities. \r\n\r\nNoroy is seeking a loan of 7,500 TJS to add to her stock and meet the growing demand for clothing. At this point, one of her business goals is to find reliable and accountable suppliers to partner with. \r\n\r\nNoroy has already repaid six loans to IMON International without any delinquencies. We believe her outstanding credit history and willingness to strive for higher goals will help her repay the current loan and reach success in her business.   \r\n  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He wants to increase his working capital, and for this reason he requested a loan of 10,000 TJS. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
