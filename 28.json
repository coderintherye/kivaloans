M. A. was born February 25th, 1958 to a very poor family with five children.  Her parents would not allow the girls to work, and when Modesta wanted to work herself, her father kicked her out of the home.  She married Crist\u00f3bal Garc\u00eda when she was 18, hoping to work and escape poverty.  Modesta started her first business at the age of 23 selling clothing.  She worked very hard, travelling to distant villages with her young daughter where she sometimes accepted payment in bartered produce rather than cash.  She skipped meals in order to keep working. At other times, she and her daughter would lunch on nothing but bananas and water.  Her second job was cleaning homes for a lawyer, who was quite supportive.  He paid her a few cents, and every evening Modesta brought home some bread to her children.  When her daughter was older, but still very young, she wanted to start selling beauty products, but the franchise didn't allow minors to sell for them, so Modesta and her daughter began together.  They sold more than 3,000 Guatemalan Quetzals worth every month and frequently won prizes from the promoter, but Modesta and her daughter would sell the prizes to buy more beauty products.  Right now they need a loan to expand their business and fulfill their dreams.  <p> <b> Translated by a Kiva volunteer <\/b> <p> La se\u00f1ora Modesta M.

She has been married for 28 years and has 9 children.  She has been in business for the last 24 years, with the help of her family, of course.  Presently, she sells vegetables and foodstuffs at the municipal market in San Pedro Yepocapa.  Her dream is to continue in the business that has been such a big part of her life.  She pours her whole heart into her work and thanks God for blessing her with health and good fortune.  She is also grateful for this opportunity to take out a loan and come out ahead.   Recalling her work history, Maria describes a life of hard work and good business sense.  She began 24 years ago keeping hens at home and selling their eggs.  She was able to save up 20 quetzals, a good sum in those days, and used the money to set up at the market in Chimaltenango selling beans, tomatoes and fuel for lamps, since in those days there was no electricity.  She was successful and in a few months she managed to save up 80 quetzals, with which she financed a trip to the capital to buy more merchandise.  Today, she would like to take out this loan, her second with Friendship Bridge, to invest in her current business or to buy cloth to sell at the Saturday and Sunday markets in San Pedro Yepocapa. <p> <b> Translated by a Kiva volunteer. <\/b> <p>\r\n \r\nMar\u00eda Austreberta  X.

One of her biggest dreams is to continue with her business and have a better stock, since the area where she lives is hot and fruit sells well.

She is a member of a loan group called \u201cLiz of Yepocapa Flower Community\u201d, and they meet in one of the villages. She began selling napkins 18 years ago. In the afternoons she would go out with her daughters and her aunts to sell napkins, and that is how she discovered she likes to sell. Soon she began selling corn along with her husband, and then she began working separately from her husband and began her business selling fruits at whole-sale prices. She sells pineapples, papayas, oranges, and mangoes when they are in season, and she also sells cassava roots, cooked corn on the cob, bread, etc. She sells in the municipal market of San Pedro Yepocapa. <p>She currently needs this loan to continue selling her fruits from the coast.

Description<\/h4> <p>\r\nCarlos has been in the business of buying and selling lumber for about ten years. He started his business with the help of his father, who began teaching Carlos the business at a very young age. In time, Carlos began trying to become independent, and with the salary his father gave him, Carlos started to buy his own logs. He transports the logs from Esmeraldas and processes them into lumber in his home town of Guayaquil. He makes two trips each month to buy logs, which he saws and sells in Guayaquil.\r\n<h4>Purpose of Loan<\/h4> <p>\r\nCarlos wants to buy a new chainsaw, his most valuable tool. The one he has now doesn't work too well. It's time for a new one, considering that the useful life of a chainsaw is about one year.\r\n<h4>About the Applicant<\/h4> <p>\r\nCarlos is thirty-one. He is married and has a five-year-old girl who attends school. His wife teaches in a primary school, and she helps make ends meet. Right now, they don't live in their own home but rent an apartment.

In order to do so, she would like to borrow money from TYM Fund.  Her husband, Ngo Dinh Thoa, a security officer, also gives her a lot of support.  According to him, TYM Fund does not only lend people money but also teaches them how to use the money wisely and helps them increase social knowledge.  Having been a TYM member for 10 years, he knows that what he believes is right.  Now total income of both T. and Thoa is $130 per month, which is a big improvement compared to theirs before joininng TYM.  Their sons, one is 15 and the other is 12 years old, also help their mother with the store during their free time.  She is looking forward to borrow $575 to expand the store and increase the number of goods sold everyday.    \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nM\u1eb7c d\u00f9 l\u00e0m 5 s\u00e0o ru\u1ed9ng, 5 s\u00e0o c\u00e2y \u0103n qu\u1ea3 v\u00e0 m\u1ed9t ao c\u00e1, ch\u1ecb \u0110o\u00e0n Th\u1ecb Th\u1ecbnh, 33 tu\u1ed5i, v\u1eabn quy\u1ebft \u0111\u1ecbnh m\u1edf th\u00eam m\u1ed9t c\u1eeda h\u00e0ng t\u1ea1p h\u00f3a. \u0110\u1ec3 c\u00f3 ti\u1ec1n mua h\u00e0ng ch\u1ecb tham gia vay v\u1ed1n Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng.

He makes a good profit during the winter for this very reason. \r\n<p>For the warmer season, Nicolai would like to increase his stock of seasonal shoes such as flip-flops, sport and casual shoes and has requested a loan to purchase inventory. Recently, all the kiosks in the marketplace were remodeled and the entrepreneurs had to pay their rent up front. Most of the money for this came from the family\u2019s working capital so Nicolai needs a cash infusion to be able to update his stock of shoes. He makes about $300 to $400 per month and has $2,000 invested in his products.

Mrs. Em Nareth has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap, KIVA partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-07-16T07:39:12Z","paid_date":"2008-02-22T08:09:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":14002,"name":"Khin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khin was married in 1969 and has 2 children, 1 son and 1 daughter.

A. is the proud owner of Venta de Comestico, a general store in La Union, a quaint community in the northern province of Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic.  Although she is without a physical storefront, Eliana provides an additional service to her customers by faithfully delivering her customer\u2019s orders to their homes.  She will use this first loan to expand her inventory of cosmetic and hygienic supplies to better meet the needs of her community.
