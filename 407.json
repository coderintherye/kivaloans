The members of this group are from the city of Temuco. They are involved in dessert-making, sewing, running a book store, a general store, and selling chocolates, household materials, clothing and undergarments, fruit and flowers.\r\n\r\nThe group member for this interview was Elizabeth, who is the group\u2019s treasurer. In the photo she is in the front row, on the left, in a green sweater, holding the hand of one of her associate\u2019s sons. She runs a general store out of her home where she sells fruit, basic household goods, and other items. She runs the business on her own.\r\n\r\nElizabeth will invest this loan in more merchandise (sugar, rice, pasta, detergent, and shampoo), and in firewood and coal, which will be needed in this region in southern Chile for the cold winter. Because these are needed products, this will be a good business. Her dream is to increase the variety of merchandise in her store.\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s greatest motivation is her 13 year-old daughter; she wants to give her everything she needs for her basic and advanced studies so that she can secure a solid economic future for herself.\r\n\r\nWhat Elizabeth has liked best about working with Fondo Esperanza has been the opportunity the organization has given her to move forward, without putting up obstacles to her ability to access credit. Additionally, the good treatment she has received in the entrepreneur training and educational workshops, has made her feel valued and important.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. It is located 670 kilometers south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lake-side spa resorts and striking flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile\u2019s indigenous Mapuche community live; some of whom are members of Fondo Esperanza communal

With an earlier loan, he finished building a room. He now needs to plaster the walls, paint, and tile the floor. What he will do first, however, is change the roof, which is in a poor condition and really needs improvement.\r\n\r\nHis plan for the long term is to be able to work full time and earn more, so he can save up to complete his home improvements. He is pleased with what he has achieved up to now on his limited resources.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":546492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"To buy zinc, solder, and other roofing materials for his home ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":916.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":916.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":916.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":931.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151822121,"comment":null},{"amount":0.76,"local_amount":15.97,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":16.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159562152,"comment":null},{"amount":42.09,"local_amount":881.96,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":895.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166771058,"comment":null},{"amount":88.4,"local_amount":1852.08,"processed_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1881.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204950,"comment":null},{"amount":41.62,"local_amount":872.06,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":885.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465795,"comment":null},{"amount":88.47,"local_amount":1853.71,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1883.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097935,"comment":null},{"amount":50.58,"local_amount":1059.78,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:48:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1076.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348530,"comment":null},{"amount":38.08,"local_amount":797.8,"processed_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:05:06Z","rounded_local_amount":810.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766204,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":2749.97,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2793.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209272,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-28T11:39:37Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":204067,"name":"Carlitos","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carlitos F. was born in Zambezia province 36 years ago.

Noudagnon was born on January 21, 1979 in Podji in B\u00e9nin. Married to HOUNKANRIN Bernadette, a petty trader, Noudagnon is the father of one child who is attending school. Noudagnon is also raising another child. Since his birth, Noudagnon has been living in the Adonv\u00ea area in Ekp\u00e8, in the township of S\u00e8m\u00e8-Podji. Noudagnon still lives with his family in this district. The couple share in supporting their family. \r\n\r\nNoudagnon left school at the secondary level and learned the trade of electrician. He has been working in this trade for about seven years. Secondarily, he sells charcoal. He buys his supplies in Cotonou, economic capital of B\u00e9nin.  In order to raise the level of his business and equip himself with electrical supplies, and thus better serve his clientele, Noudagnon is requesting, for the first time, a loan from ALID\u00e9. He hopes later on to be able to open a store selling electrical goods, which would allow him to increase his earnings. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

He has bought materials such as flooring and cement for the house, but he still needs more material and he hopes to get the improvements done soon in order to have better hygiene in his home.\r\nWith this loan, he will buy tools to help him with his daily work, such as: a handsaw, a plane, and a welder, among others. These cost a lot and he has not managed to buy them on his own; thus, he will buy them with this loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":546532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"tools for home improvements","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":24.53,"local_amount":490.62,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":522.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159562153,"comment":null},{"amount":42.14,"local_amount":842.72,"processed_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":896.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166771059,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":709.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204951,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":709.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330644,"comment":null},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":709.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465796,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":1333.34,"processed_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1419,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348531,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1333.31,"processed_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1418.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209273,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-05T20:51:57Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":204088,"name":"No\u00eblie","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"K.

He lives with his wife and their three children in the Monsef\u00fa district.  This area is known on a regional level for its tourist and religious festivals.  It is also known for its wood, ceramic, and reed handicrafts.  It is located 20 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor over 20 years he has done agricultural work, especially that having to do with livestock.  He has 13 cows, and 6 of them produce milk daily.  His stable is a half hour from his house.  He goes there very early everyday to milk the cows.  He sells the milk to a wholesaler in the area. \r\n\r\nAs this activity is his only source of income, Pablo always feeds his livestock well and takes good care of them.

It is an agricultural area belonging to the Lambayeque province, situated 45 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor 4 years he has raised and sold animals.  He raises barnyard birds and small animals in a poultry yard located behind the house where he lives.  When the birds have reached an adequate size and weight he sells them to the traders who often visit the area where he lives.  The earnings he receives from this business are used to cover his personal expenses and to help support the finances of the family.\r\n\r\nWalter always tries to provide his animals with quality feed, so that they develop properly and are well received on the part of his buyers.  Currently he wants to acquire more young animals and also buy the nutritionally balanced feed to finish raising them.

The couple care for three children, two of whom are their own. All of the children go to school. Marie has lived with her family for five years in the Kadjacome area of Cotonou, the financial capital of Benin. The couple work together to meet the family's needs. Marie never went to school. In order to survive and to be able to look after her children, Marie sells fish and prawns from a mobile street stall. Marie buys her produce in Cotonou.

","en":"Mr. Magatte G. has been a mechanic, goods carrier and driver of a fast coach for the past ten years. He is married, 57 years old and he is father and breadwinner for a family of five children, whose ages vary between two and 17 years old. He also has responsibility for five other relatives. He has been a shareholder-member of the Baye-Laye savings bank since June 2009 and has never had a loan from the institution. Previously, he was an apprentice mechanic but now he has a mechanics certificate. It is above all during the period of Magal and Tabaski that his activity really booms. He is requesting a loan of 500,000 francs to repair his fast coach which has broken down. It is a vehicle which allows him to provide transport around town for his passengers, and this brings him a daily income, which enables him to manage his family and save on a regular basis to provide for unforseen expenses.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

One day she decided to start an informal business selling clothing in addition to tackling her duties as a homemaker.  She generates sales by taking orders and then travels in order to buy directly from the distributors.  Her customers live near her home and she has been selling for three years.  In addition, she started another business a year ago selling fast food such as hot dogs, hamburgers, and fried foods.  Adriana enjoys working and is doing well in all of her ventures.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this new loan, she plans to invest in her two businesses so that she can expand and continue making sales.  She has maintained a relationship with her husband for nine years.  He earns a living by driving a tanker truck throughout the region.  Her dream is to purchase a vehicle so that she can travel with her merchandise since it is difficult to take her products with her on the bus.  Adriana is sure that she can achieve this goal since having her own car will allow her to help her husband.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

As we can see in the photo, there are 12 members in the group named Mirador de Matilde, to showcase their location in the state of Hidalgo.\nMaria Alicia is a single mother of two children, who work and help her with some of the household expenses. She sells chicken and is requesting this loan to invest in a new scale, because the one she has does not work well. She also wants to paint her business so that it will look its best. She mentions that she works very hard, Monday to Saturday, with the aim of saving up for when she is no longer able to work. However, for now she greatly enjoys her business and the most gratifying element is her rapport with her customers.\nThe group's treasurer is Martha Silvia F., who has sold beauty products through a catalogue for 8 years. She is in a common-law marriage and has two children ages 24 and 13. She is requesting this loan to invest in a larger inventory which she will buy at a lower price and thus be able to make more profit. She has a large number of customers thanks to her years of experience selling these products.\nThe group members are hard-working and enterprising women; Gizeh B., for example, is 24, married and has a 5-year-old child. She sells gifts and will invest her credit in material to decorate the gifts she wraps, and to buy glass for her display case, since some of the panes are broken. At this moment, this is what she needs for her business in order to earn a little bit more. She believes that success is the result of daily work, and she would like to see her business grow significantly because she knows that with it she will be able to offer her little child a better life.\n\nThe other group members are:\n\nElvira Hern\u00e1ndez Ram\u00edrez\t         Quilt sales\nYadira Mart\u00ednez D.

Divina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to  purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Divina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Divina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

The son and the husband also breed cattle to make money. With money received from the loan, Baktygul wants to purchase three farm animals for breeding. In the future she plans to increase the number of livestock and improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nShaiyrkul S. is the treasurer of the group. She is 55 and a widow. She has raised a daughter and two sons. The daughter is married, the older son went to Russia to make some money, and the younger son helps his mom around the farm. Shaiyrkul has been breeding cattle for 20 years, if she needs money she can sell some cattle. With money received from the loan, she wants to purchase one farm animal in order to increase the number of livestock.\r\n\r\nShapanbubu I. is 57 and her husband is a pensioner. They have three sons and six daughters. The older children are married and live separately with their families. The younger son and the younger daughter study at school.  Shapanbubu and her husband have been farming for 16 years, since 1994. Now she applied for the loan because she needs money to pay for tractor service, to purchase 50 litters of fuel, which is needed for the sowing process, and buy some cattle for breeding. \r\n\r\nTurumkan K. is 58 and married. She has four sons and two daughters. All the children are married and live separately with their families.

Vergie has successfully repaid a previous loan of PHP 13,000 from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Vergie is requesting a new loan of PHP 10,000 which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Vergie from ASKI.

C. is from the village of Alibago, Enrile, Cagayan. She is 35 years-old and married with one school-aged child. To make a living, Rosalie owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Rosalie has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalie joined Kiva partner ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. Rosalie is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Rosalie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her husband is retired. She has a son and two daughters. Her son works as a welder and the daughters own a private sewing workshop. Sometimes they send pieces of material that are left over after production and Kulai makes traditional clothes and accessories. In this way she makes 1500 soms ($32.65) per month. Kulai and her husband also breed livestock. With money received from the loan, she will purchase 30 chickens and two other farm animals in order to increase the number of livestock. In the future Kulai plans to buy a kiosk and sell convenience goods.\r\n\r\nToktogul M. is 63. His wife is retired. They have a grandchild who studies at school. Toktogul and his wife have been breeding livestock for a long time. When necessary, they sell livestock to make money. In this way they make 2000 soms ($43.54) per month. Toktogul applied for the loan because he needs money to purchase cattle for breeding.\r\n\r\nMairmakan K. is the treasurer of the group. She is 61 and married. They have two sons, who fish to earn money. Six years ago, with the initial investment of 500 soms ($10.88), Mairamkan began to take orders and sew traditional clothes. In this way she earns 1500 soms ($32.65) per month. That profit made her able to purchase cattle for 18000 soms ($391.90). Mairamkan needs a loan to purchase one cow and two other farm animals. In the future she wants to expand the business and export her products to Kazakhstan.\r\n\r\nKanymbubu I. is 60. Her husband is retired. Their grandchild lives with them; he is thirteen and attends school. Kanymbubu and her husband have been breeding cattle and cultivating different fruits and vegetables for about 40 years. Selling fruits and vegetables they make 2000 soms ($43.54) per month. Kanymbubu applied for the loan, because she needs money to pay for tractor services and purchase fuel, which is needed for the sowing process in the summer season.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young, ambitious and socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

is a 49 year-old provider of photocopying and secretarial services. She offers typing, stationery, photography, and photocopying services to business people and students in a shop on a busy street. She has been in this business for 7 years. Milka is single and has 2 children. \r\n\r\nThe primary challenges that she faces are the breakdown of photocopiers. Before offering secretarial services, she worked in a salon.

A. is from the village of Talakag Bukidnon. She is 59 years old. Victoria is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Victoria owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Victoria has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Victoria joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

Victoria is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Victoria from HSPFI.

C. is from the village of Salawagan, Quezon Bukidnon. She is 53 years old, married and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Rosalinda owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Rosalinda has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP per month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Rosalinda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rosalinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as working capital and to purchase additional inventory. Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Rosalinda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

As a result Mr. D. has been developing a small business for over 20 years. It is an activity he chose out of love and also because of its lucrative aspect. He is requesting a loan of 100,000 francs to buy millet, corn, peanut and other food products which can be sold on the market. He has no fixed place in the market but when he gets back from his travels he places his products immediately with his customers. This loan will allow him to increase his profits by 35,000 francs per week and per trip. The increase in his earnings will allow him to resolve his rent problems and manage his daily expenses better.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":547077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Strengthening of working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-05-28T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djiby","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:27Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971420,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708710,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922741,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-04T14:22:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189256,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484675,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620919,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-27T11:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188758492,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-19T11:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191495395,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195923366,"comment":null},{"amount":20,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:19:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10739.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201365786,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-29T02:42:10Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:19:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":204434,"name":"Sakaria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sakaria is a 38 year-old clothing merchant.

The four members of the group are Francisca S., Refugio C., Juana G., and Ma Esperanza C..  Their business activities are as follows:  Francisca sells shoes at retail; Refugio creates paintings to sell; Juana sells fritters and donuts in the evenings; and Ma Esperanza wants to sell food on the weekends.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Francisca S. is a member of the group.  She is married and has three children (ages 20, 17, and 12).  Francisca wants to concentrate on her business so that she can help her husband with the household expenses.  She is confident that selling shoes and sandals is a good business and plans to offer her products in the main squares of the surrounding villages in her community.  The people who live there have limited resources, so she does not want to sell anything expensive.\r\n<p>\r\nFrancisca will use her loan to buy sandals, shoes, boots, flip-flops, and other items in Leon Guanajuato.  Her goal for the future is to have a great business and many customers so that one day her children can get ahead and earn a degree.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Francisca says she feels very fortunate to have been granted a loan.

She lives in her own house with her family and supports her mother and granddaughter who live with her.\r\n\r\nShe has never left her hometown.  For more than 11 years, Carolina has worked as a teacher for the Ministry of Education.  She has no employees and has a salary of 4,500 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses.  She also saves some of this money in her bank account.\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks and learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers of this institution.  This is Carolina's third loan.  She is asking for 10,000 meticais, which she will use to buy construction materials (sand, stone, zinc sheets, cement and other items) to finish building her house.\r\n\r\nCarolina promises to pay off this loan on time to maintain her credit.

Mary is a manufacturer of local soap popularly known as \u2018Azuma blow\u2019 because it looks like the blow of the renowned Ghanaian boxer named Azuma Nelson. \r\n\r\nThe soap is prepared by combining materials like palm oil, soda powder, cocoa pods and coconut oil and hardener to obtain the soap. The soap can be used for bathing, washing and the like. It is relatively very affordable and much patronized in the rural communities. Mary has operated her business for the past twenty years and is excited to be taking out this loan, with which she plans to purchase ingredients for soap-making.\r\n\r\nMary is divorced and she is the mother of six children. The other members in the group are also engaged in trades such as food-selling, palm oil production, grocery sales, used clothes sales, etc. They plan to invest the loan to purchase stock in bulk to grow their businesses.

Both have the same type of business; raising hogs.  Carla has been doing this for more than 12 years and is constantly concerned with improving her economic status and that of her family.  She began selling firewood and later decided to buy hogs to fatten them up.  She noticed that she was getting good results, so she also helped Sa\u00fal become involved in the same business and they work together toward the same goal.

He is 27 years old, married, and has two children who are 6 and 2 years old.  Neither of the children goes to school yet.  Joaquim only finished eighth grade and did not continue school because of financial problems, as he lost his father while still young.  He lives in his own house with his family and supports two brothers who live with him.\r\n\r\nJoaquim left Manhi\u00e7a to move to Boane District with his parents when he was very young.  For more than two years he has had his own shoe resale business.  He also builds brick houses.  He has one employee who helps him with his work, and he earns about 9,000 meticais per month, which he uses for household expenses and still manages to save some money through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans from other banks.  Joaquim learned about Hluvuku through his mother, who is also a customer of this institution.  This is his first loan.  He is asking for 9,000 meticias to buy pairs of shoes so he can increase his inventory.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay off this loan on time so he will be able to take out more loans.  In the future, he intends to ask for more loans to use in his business, and one of his dreams is to have a nice shop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

They have three loans and are one of the most responsible groups when it comes to repayment.  Natividad has been selling general merchandise, such as clothing, cosmetics and shoes, for the past 20 years.  She is 44 years old and she and her husband have worked hard to get their family ahead.  Having their children come out ahead it a top priority for them.  She is asking for this loan in order to buy inventory for her business.  She sells her products in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nMarta also sells general merchandise and buys her products in the west market where she can get them for better prices.  This way she can earn a little bit more.

She lives in her own house with her two younger daughters, and her greatest desire is to provide them with a better future. Elsa's fields are the best-kept of the village of Carit\u00e1, since she takes good care of them and works with great patience and dedication. Because of this, she obtains good harvests, which are taken to the wholesale market in the city of Tarma for sale, since better prices are offered there, making the business profitable. She has worked in this area for 30 years, and what she likes best about her work is planting her crops; what she considers most difficult is fumigating her fields, since she has to use chemical products which affect her health. Over time, she hopes to buy more land in order to increase her production. This is her sixth loan with MFP; she has always been very punctual in making her payments, and she plans to continue in this manner. In her communal bank, she is known as a very cheerful and responsible person.
