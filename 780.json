With this business she has achieved personal growth, strengthened her autonomy, and also generated revenue to sustain her family, which is made up of two grown daughters who support her and have always been her source of inspiration to work persistently and to get ahead. Her future goal is to have a shop separate from her home so she may enjoy a calm home. Her greatest challenge is to have sufficient working capital to respond to her growing customer base which always makes orders. This is the reason for which she has turned to her first Kiva loan, the first loan she has requested from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo [Mario Santo Domingo Foundation]. She will purchase sweets, drinks, and soda pop with the loan, taking advantage of the coming festival season by stocking the items she sells the most, which will guarantee a successful investment.

She has a seven year old child, and he has always been her motivation to work harder every day.  Liliana has always dreamed of starting her own company.  That is why she is now putting forth great effort to get her business ahead.\r\n\r\nLiliana waits on customers in a restaurant in her municipality.  When she finishes her work day she makes desserts that she distributes to some restaurants in the municipality.  Her desserts are known for their good flavor and for the good quality of service that she offers.  This is why, little by little, her sales have been increasing considerably.\r\n\r\nAs Liliana makes the desserts manually or by hand, she does not have a large production.  That is why she has not been able to take care of the large orders that some of her customers are making lately.  With the aim of being able to increase production of her desserts, Liliana is looking to buy an industrial blender.  This will allow her to make the process more industrialized, and she will be able to speed up production.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lilian does not have enough capital to buy this machine.  That is why she has the hope that a loan will give her the possibility of buying an industrial blender, which will allow her to make more desserts in less time.\r\n\r\nLiliana hopes that her income increases and that she will be able to take care of customers that she previously could not.

This is why everyone who knows him considers him to be very enterprising. At the age of 21, he sells fast food. He learned the business from his mother and now he wants to develop it on his own to earn money for household expenses. Jonathan always wanted to have his own activity and today his business is well known because his food is very good and of high quality. Jonathan contributes to family expenses in order to offer a better quality of life to his parents and know financial progress. Thanks to the good products his sales have increased considerably, and therefore he wants to buy more ingredients for his fast food dishes.

Jonathan dreams of having a large restaurant that is well known in his neighborhood and could provide employment to people who need it most.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":997419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients for fast food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jonathan Andres ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35587},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36592},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37625},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38687},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39779},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40902},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42056},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43243},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44464},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45719},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47010},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48336}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.57},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T03:09:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":388647,"name":"Jonathan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jonathan is 50 years old, married, and the father of four children.

All her children still live at home. Several years ago she took tailoring classes in a local academy. \r\n\r\nIn order to help her children get ahead, she started a small sewing shop in her home nine years ago, where she works sewing all kinds of clothes. She works from specific orders placed by individuals who come to her shop to have their clothes made. She tells us that what she makes most is sleepwear. She works based on orders from individuals and also delivers the garments she makes to bazaars\u200b\u200b. She works every day from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., and sometimes even later when she has orders to deliver. She has worked in this profession for more than 15 years. \r\n\r\nShe told us that with her last loan everything went smoothly and that it turned out well. She was current on all her payments and there were no complications. She is repeating the loan because all of the loans that she has received from the bank have helped her greatly with her business and with her personal life. Since she has the responsibility to cover the costs of her home and for her children, the loan helped her to improve her business and with the profits she was able to cover certain costs associated with her daughter studying to the university. This new loan will be used to buy fabric, thread, buttons and other materials for sewing. \r\n\r\nShe is a founding member of the communal bank and the president; she likes the group because it is very united and responsible. Her dreams are to continue moving forward with her sewing shop and that her daughter will be a great professional.

She lives in a residential area very close to the sea with her husband and her three children who range from 16 years. She sells cheese, cold meats and also products through specialized catalogs, such as perfumes and cosmetics, on credit. Her sales are made with select customers, for whom she looks for the best prices, for the sake of keeping them faithful.\n\nHer business idea began 3 years ago, 15 years after having arrived from Sinc\u00e9 in the department of Sucre to work providing services in various offices in the city of Barranquilla. With a loan that she made through her mother, in order to work independently, she began to sell cheese and cold meats through the distribution system among her friends, relatives and neighbors, and so it was that her income began to increase and she was able to add other products that her customers needed. \n\nMarta has her own house.

Hair styling is in his blood, Jesse said, as he comes from a family of hair stylists. Before birth, his aunt owned and operated a salon that has now been in business for about 50 years. \"I've always wanted to work for myself and just kind of make my mom proud,\" he said. \"That was my goal though I began as a cook.\"\r\n\r\nJesse sensed there was a lack of knowledge and a pool of stylists attempting non-chemical treatments, so he made it top priority to go to school and change his career. Non-chemical does not mean that he does not know how to dye hair or care for chemically treated hair. His business niche is to work with such natural hair styles as dread locks, which he has been doing for 30 years, braids, corn rows, teasing, and the like. \r\n\r\nJesse had done business in Louisiana since 1996 until Hurricane Katrina devastated the state in 2005 and prompted him to re-locate to Texas. So he's especially appreciative of the lending assistance he received from ACCION Texas Inc., as he found re-starting his business in a different state was a complicated endeavor. \r\n\r\nHe employs 11 hair stylists and plans to hire more within the next year. In order to do that though, he will need a larger building in Austin's downtown. This, he said, may necessitate another loan. For the time being, Jesse is using the money to replace two styling chairs, purchase two TVs (which his clients have requested), and use the rest for marketing. The loan from ACCION Texas allows him to respond to clients' requests and recommendations. \"It's all about them,\" he said. \r\n\r\nCheck out his websites at: www.jaeundreas.net, www.jaeundreas.com

29 years old, married, and has a daughter and a son, both of preschool age. The family lives in the village Ak-Suu in the Moskovsky region. Lidiya was born and grew up in the village Belovodskoye, in a family of farmers. After graduating from high school, she entered the Pedagogical Institute in the city of Bishkek, where she became acquainted with her future husband Sergej. In 2003, when she was starting her third year, they got married. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning the couple lived in a rented apartment in Bishkek. After having finished the education, they moved to the village Belovodskoye, to Lidiya's relatives. Lidiya explains that her parents gave them a cow for the wedding, so they started their first business. Over time they started to expand their farm - Lidiya's husband became engaged in field crop cultivation, taking three hectares of irrigated land to start growing crops and alfalfa. \r\n\r\nIn the village Belovodskoye, there is a small dairy factory, which takes milk from the local population and produce products such as butter, cheese, cottage cheese, cream and so on. For over more than five years, Lidiya has cooperated with this factory and delivered milk to them. Thanks to the revenue from the milk, Lidiya and her husband expanded their business - they have now rented an additional five hectares of land, where they grow sugar beets and potatoes, which gives a good profit for the family. \r\n\r\nThanks to persistent work, Lidiya's family was able to buy a small house with a barn in the village Ak-Suu in 2007, where they keep six cows, three horses and four bulls. In order to further develop her business, Lidiya turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional livestock. In the near future, Lidiya plans to increase the revenue from selling milk, and use the income to increase the number of livestock. In the future, Lidiya plans to expand the farm, to have the opportunity to provide her children with education at a good university."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1000385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Suu village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":2800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":43000},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":43000},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":44000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":926.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":926.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":947.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-08T11:20:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389064,"name":"Abraham","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thirty-five-year-old Abraham is married to Julia and is blessed with two children aged seven and five.

Nader is photographed in the picture.\n\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs.

In the beginning, he launched his business selling oysters on the streets of the city. Later, he began to familiarize himself with fishing in the river, and worked at that. But the increasing difficulties that arose made him stop this, and just work buying and selling fish such as bocachico, mullet, corvina, and goatfish.\r\n\r\nWhen he started his retail business, he invested a small amount of capital and attracted a few customers among his friends and people very close to his family.  With his effort, his business started to grow, and now he he has more than 60 independent buyers. He also sells to restaurants and takes orders from customers. \r\n\r\nIn the morning he takes the fish around, and collects the money in the afternoon hours. He also has customers living nearby, who buy from him at his home and often place orders with him. He purchases directly from the fishermen, with whom he has established an effective business relationship.\r\n\r\nFernando has a passion for this work, because through it he has managed to support his family, own his own house, and to use his knowledge of fresh fish. His goal is to eventually have a fish store, where he can keep his fish, and sell them at a very well-known place by the river.  Likewise he hopes to see his children fulfilled and successful in whatever they undertake. \r\n\r\nAt the present time, he is applying for his first credikiva, and also the first loan he is taking out with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He will use it to buy a freezer to store a greater number of fish. He will buy product in greater quantity so that he can get discounts from the fishermen, who are also hoping to do business with him, so that they can obtain their income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":997426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"To buy a freezer for storing a greater number of fish, allowing him to buy product in larger quantities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T22:40:03Z","loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fernanado Rafael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":68844},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73562},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75278},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77035},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78832},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80672},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82554},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84480},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":86451},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92292}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.52},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.63},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-02-18T17:19:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389087,"name":"Zainabu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zainab is a 26-year-old single woman.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

In search of an income source for her family, Dunuya began her own grocery business in 2002. She started with 3000 som (KGS) and has since developed the grocery store into a striving business which yields 5,000 som (KGS) monthly using her hard work and perseverance. Dunuya brings her goods from various markets and also drives out to the city of Osh, which is 240 km\/150 miles away to purchase inventory for her store. In order to expand her business, Dunuya has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) which she plans to use to expand her inventory. The profits from this expansion Dunuya will invest in further growing her

After the break-up of the Soviet Union, Beyshebubu began raising livestock, and this activity became the main source of income for her family. Beyshebubu began her business with a starting capital of 10,000 som (KGS), and was able to grow it so that it now has 10 sheep, 3 cows and 2 horses, and earns a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS). In order to continue developing her business, Beyshebubu has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional livestock and fodder.

For the past two years, Mariam's husband has also been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project.\n\nMariam is requesting a loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of making some necessary repairs to the taxi such as painting, changing the engine, etc., in order to improve the taxi's condition. This will increase the taxi's efficiency and ability to take more requests, which will improve the family's income.\n\nAbout this loan product:\n\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0 percent interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

Thanks to her tenacity and persistance, her business now consists of one dairy cow and twenty sheep and brings about 10,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of dairy and meat products.  Toktokhan also cultivates beans on 3 hectares of land.  In order to further develop her business, Toktokhan has turned to \"Bai Tushum & Partners\", for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS).

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nErlinda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also operates a small barber shop for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nErlinda hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":59.37,"image":{"id":1001063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"   To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-07T12:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-08T12:50:17Z","loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":2499.99,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2531.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275499,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T14:49:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":389370,"name":"Rizalina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rizalina is 57 years old and a widow with 3 children.
