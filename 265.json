It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

education is the most important inheritance Muborak and her husband can give to their two dear children. They are both very responsible parents, and they work very hard in agriculture and farming so that they can give their children the opportunity to finish school \u2013 an opportunity they never had due to poor finances. This happy mother has been working in agriculture since getting married and, with the unconditional help of her husband and son (pictured), she buys and sells cattle in order to cover the family\u2019s most urgent needs. Even so, she now finds herself with more expenditure, and she would like a loan in order to increase their capital by increasing their number of cattle. Muborak and her family are waiting for your quick response.  \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Elma is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product selection. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Elma from HSPFI.

Business is good, and she is now taking out her sixth loan from Esperanza.\r\n\r\nThis loan will allow Juana to buy more shrimp and fish to sell, and a brand new net especially designed to catch shrimp. This net will allow Juana and her father to increase their income and live a better life.  With previous loans, the two have bought a motorcycle, which allows them to buy food and go fishing in places previously difficult to reach.\r\n\r\nJuana currently lives with her husband and three children, who are between the ages of 5 and 13, and is hoping to earn enough money to do some home improvements. She would love to buy a refrigerator and a stove for her kitchen, along with bars to protect her windows from rocks and other objects thrown by the children in the neighborhood.

She sold them at a local market on Fifth Avenue in Comayaguela, but she lost her entire business due to a fire on July 30th.  Everything was completely reduced to ashes and the loss was approximately $3,750.  She is requesting a loan to restart her business since she doesn't have capital to reinvest in more products.  The mayor of Tegucigalpa is going to help rebuild the wooden market stalls, but if this doesn't happen, she is going to become a travelling salesperson in the meantime.

S. lives in the region of Calichera de Comas. She is 37 years old and she has separated from her husband. In order to provide for her minor children, she has to work hard. A few years ago, Ana started to sell pottery. She used to buy her pottery supplies and sell the pottery door-to-door. This routine kept her busy almost all day long and she was forced to leave her children alone. When she realised that her little children needed her presence, Ana decided to change business. With the loans she has received from EDAPROSPO, Ana invested in sweets, groceries, and soft drinks and she set up a small grocery story in her own house. Now she can work and at the same time spend more time with her children, who are the reason for so much sacrifice, but give her motivation. To date, Ana owns a small grocery store, which is her main source of income. With the profit from the store, she can cover her personal expenses and also part of the house expenses. Her dream is to own a clothes and gifts store in a commercial centre.

She had no experience in the cleaning industry, but fell into it when a friend asked her if she wanted to earn some extra money by helping a family member paint his house. The homeowner was so impressed by her work that he asked for her housekeeping help on a regular basis\r\n\r\nIn the last year, Tan has quickly built a base of 20 clients for her residential janitorial service business, Maid By Me, and has developed a following on Yelp.com. Tan differentiates her business by using only natural cleaning products like baking soda, vinegar, steam, and lemons. She loves a challenge now and then, like carpet stains, candle wax, and hard water deposit removal. She prides herself in not leaving anything unfinished.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Tan does not have the equipment or staff to service more than three houses a day, and has to turn down clients. Her lack of credit history made her ineligible for a bank loan or a credit card. She is grateful for a $2,000 loan from Opportunity Fund, which she will use to purchase two heavy-duty vacuums, cleaning supplies, and an outdoor storage container. \r\n\r\nTan has one dedicated full-time employee, and in the future would like the ability to add to her staff so she can take on more of a business management role. \r\n\r\nShe says, \u201cOne day when I expand, my staff will clean as I do...no exceptions!  I\u2019ve been running the show for about a year and a half now with much success. Success in my definition is keeping my clients happy--not just satisfied.\u201d  \r\n\r\nLearn more on the Maid by Me website at http:\/\/www.creamofthecrops.toesinthegrass.info\/html\/maid_by_me.html

Their businesses incluD. bakeries, handicrafts, textiles, food sales, clothing, and beauty products.\r\n<p>\r\nThe entire group meets once a month at the home of one its members in order to collect their payments.  The president is in charge of their meetings and makes sure that everything has been completed.  Sra. Ana V. M. currently holds this position.  She has been raising farm animals from her home for the past 12 years.  She breeds guinea pigs, chickens, turkeys, and ducks.  She also makes cakes, prepared meals, and buffets for various events.  Sra. Ana receives orders regularly, so she is able to generate income to pay for her family expenses and make home repairs.   She can proviD. a normal life for her children and not have to be solely dependent on her husband\u2019s income.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Ana used her first loan to buy vegetable dyes for cakes, pastry molds and kitchenware.  These supplies were needed to make <i>quincea\u00f1os<\/i> (15th birthday) cakes.  She will use her current loan to buy a new pot and acrylic cake decorations so that she does not have to rent these items.  What she needs to buy is a refrigerator because it is a necessity for her business that will help her generate more profits from her future sales. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

They are people devoted to planting alfalfa, raising guinea pigs, selling flowers, sweets, food, and groceries.  Most of them sell their products in the markets and stops.  They have fixed customers.\r\n\r\nJulia P. P. is the president of this group.  She has been selling pudding for eight years.  There is much consumer demand for her pudding because the flavor is incomparable.  She also works cleaning houses once in a while.  With these businesses she has supported her family.  The businesses also allowed her to buy some guinea pigs.  She now needs to put up a fence.  The one she had was damp, and it crumbled into pieces from the landslide that fell on her house.  She plans to invest in this.  She will also buy new dessert glasses that she herself has made in a factory.\r\n\r\nAngela D. R. is the treasurer; she has known how to do her work well.  Four years ago she bought some guinea pigs, ten female and one male, with the money she put together from the occasional jobs she had.  In time, the guinea pigs started multiplying.  She now has 35 females and 15 males.  She invests the money from the loan in food for her animals.  She will buy \u201ccuyina\u201d (guinea pig feed), an essential food for guinea pigs, along with alfalfa and some vitamins.\r\n\r\nAngela will invest this loan in renovating a cage for the guinea pigs because, with time, the outside has worn out.

16, 13, 11, and 5 in the district of Santa Rosa, located 25 minutes from the city of Chiclayo. <p>\r\nFor 5 years now, she has been selling freshwater and saltwater fish. Every day, she gets up very early and heads to her local fish market to purchase fish, then sells it at the market in the district of Pomalca, located some 10 minutes from the city of Chiclayo. <p>\r\nHer husband\u2014like the majority of men in the area\u2014works in artisan fishing. During the closed season, he helps Manuela out with her small business. They depend on these jobs to cover the daily family expenses, and they work hard every day so that together they can give their family the best. <p>\r\nShe would like to finish home construction and to keep investing in their children\u2019s education by helping them get some sort of technical degree. For this reason, she needs to request a 1,100.00 PEN loan from our institute for the very first time. She is planning on investing this money in expanding her business by purchasing more fish to sell to her customers. <p>\r\nManuela is very well-known at the Pomalca market. Her customers turn to her because they trust in the quality of the products that she sells. Her co-workers consider her to be a very active and responsible woman. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva

H. is a woman of faith and courage to overcome poverty that impedes the way of her family to success.

She lives in the island village in the town of Binangonan, Rizal province in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with hopes of having access to capital for her business of raising hogs. Her previous loans were her capital in starting the business of hog raising and she manages it well and it brings in good income. She wants to continue the business and will make more investments in it.\r\n\r\nNow she is requesting a loan of 25,000 pesos as her fifth loan in ASHI to pay for five piglets, 14 sacks of assorted feeds, vitamins and transportation expenses. She believes that her hog raising business will grow and she dreams of expanding it and making it a pig farm. She also dreams of sending her children to school until they finish college and find

She is married to Ronnie, 35 years old. She has two daughters to take care of. She lives in the busy town of Morong, Rizal province in the Philippines.  She is a living picture of a mother whose dream is to provide a decent life for her children.\r\n\r\nShe is an expert in the house rental business, since she has a house in the city and a family is renting it. She receives payment on a monthly basis. The business is good but sometimes she has encountered problems, especially when the lessee could not pay her rent payment for a month. She needed to think of another business to support her house rental business.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with dreams of having capital for her planned business of reselling items. She has been doing the resale business for two years already. The business brings her enough proceeds and seems to be growing. She wants to invest more in her resale business.\r\n\r\nOn her ninth loan, she requests an amount of 40,000 pesos as additional capital for her resale business. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for ten sacks of commercial rice, 45 cases of assorted soft drinks, five sacks of sugar, and ten gallons of cooking oil; all for resale.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of expanding her business. She also aspires of building an additional housing unit for rent and of course to send her children to school until they finish college and find

G. is from the village of Sagrada Familia, Tambulig, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 64 years old. Alfreda is married and has one adult child. To make a living, Alfreda operates a business planting and harvesting rice for sale. Alfreda has been in business for over 40 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Alfreda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alfreda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to harvest. Alfreda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizer. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Alfreda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

R. is from the village of Sagrada Familia, Tambulig, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 26 years old. Joy is married and has two infant children. To make a living, Joy operates a business planting and harvesting rice for sale. Joy has been in business for over ten years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Joy joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to harvest. Joy is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizer. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Joy from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

They have two children, ages 9 and 13. Both are in school, one in high school, the other in elementary. Anita's husband is a fish vendor.  \r\n<p>\r\nAnita runs her own hog breeding and fattening business while also attending to the needs of her children at home and doing the household chores. Anita's business started about the time she got married. At that time, she had no means of financing a hog breeding and fattening business, so she only bought piglets to fatten. Once fattened hogs are sold, after four months, the original capital is replenished; in fact, profit from this kind of business can be as much as double its capital. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen Anita joined the Kiva field partner, ASHI, in 2003, she was able to get a loan. That's when she started her hog breeding and fattening business. Now Anita has two gilts (female pigs raised for breeding) that produce piglets. Instead of selling piglets for $32 to $53, Anita chose to fatten the piglets and sell them in volume after four months, bringing in from $85 to $127 each. Profits from her business finance the family's daily needs and support her husband's fish selling business. \r\n<p>\r\nThis kind of business also incurs a lot of expenses when piglets are newly born. They need immunizations and vaccinations to insure better growth. Feed is also expensive. In order to sustain her business by meeting its financial needs, Anita is requesting a loan from ASHI that will be much larger than the one she had previously. \r\n<p>\r\nSomeday, Anita wants to have her own piggery, where she would breed and raise a lot of pigs.

L. is requesting a larger loan than last time from the Kiva field partner, ASHI, to be used for expanding her hog fattening business. She repaid the entire amount of her previous loan on time and with good business performance. \r\n<p>\r\nVirgie started her hog fattening business about the time she and her laborer husband got married. Her husband's income is sporadic and insufficient to sustain the basic needs of their four children, so Virgie's profit from her hog fattening business is important for the family's financial well-being. The profit she has from her business is as much as double the amount of its capital, once hogs are sold after four months of raising. However, she couldn't expand her business as much as she imagined, because she had no other sources of capital. Her profits are all used for family expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004, she joined ASHI for a loan which she used for her business. Since then her business started to grow along with the amount she borrows. Based on the growth of her business, the amount of capital it needs and her capacity to pay, Virgie is now requesting a larger loan. She wants her business to expand by buying more piglets to fatten and sell after four months. This way she can increase her profit to help finance the education of her children (ages 12 to 19) who are all in school. Moreover, Virgie wants to have a piggery (raise a large volume of pigs) to be able to sell more and be able to send all her children through college.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":377423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To finance her hog fattening (pig raising) business.

is Cornelia C., who is 40 years old. Her husband Apolinario, age 52, is a street vendor. They have six children, only two of whom still attend school.\r\n\r\nCornelia has been selling soft drinks, bottled water, biscuits, candy, and newspapers to commuters for a couple of years. She also offers mobile phone credits. The business is going well because her small place is in a bustling area right at the foot of a busy train station used by commuters who always need a cold drink. She makes P30, 000.00 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nCornelia likes her work a lot because she meets a lot of people and she sometimes engages them in interesting conversations. She uses her earnings to cover family\u2019s expenses and she\u2019s saving so she can have a bigger \"sari-sari\" (general) store in the near future. Her small space is always a victim of frequent clearing operations done by the city hall operatives.  \r\n\r\nCornelia needs a loan of P27,000.00 to expand her business. This is her 10th loan from the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative. What she likes most about her fellowship group is the level of trust and camaraderie among all the members. She will use the loan money to apply for business accreditation with a prominent telecommunications company, which will provide easier access to mobile phone credits.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ. \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents

A. is from the village of San Isidro, Talakag Bukidnon.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling Ready To Wear clothing items and beauty products in the local community. Charito has been engaged in her business for more than seven years and earns approximately 6,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Charito joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Charito is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Charito from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family and support the educational needs of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She wants her variety store to sell more items and commodities that are basically needed by people in their daily lives. Through the loan she requests from ASHI, she will be able to attain her plan of growing her business and satisfy her costumers with the convenience her store can offer. \nLooking back at the years when Rovelyn didn't have no one for financial and emotional support after her husband. Her eldest child then was only four years old and the youngest was eight month old. She can't afford to put up a business of her own because she has no business capital. She sells vegetables at times and had been doing other kinds of livelihood sporadically. Now, her two children are ages 28 and 33. She wasn't able to send them to school however they tried their best to find a way to earn money in order to help their mother. Her eldest daughter is working in Manila as a while domestic helper while the youngest was left in Antique and lives with her.\nThrough loans she can avail from ASHI, Rovelyn would really be doing a hardwok to grow her business for her children to take over someday.

E. is from the village of Talakag Bukidnon.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Geraldine has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Geraldine joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Geraldine is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be the first loan taken out by Geraldine from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Jasurbek is 21 years old. For more than two years he has been engaged in the business of selling coal.\r\n\r\nJasurbek buys coal from Kyrgyzstan and resells it to his customers in the market. As a result of his experience in the field, his numerous clients have a lot of trust and confidence in him and the quality of his product.\r\n\r\nJasurbek enjoys his business very much. However, he does not have adequate funds to support his business, especially with recent price hikes; therefore, he needs the loan to remain in business and to expand it. With this loan, he wants to purchase a new stock of coal to better serve his customers. He believes the loan will enable him to save more and in the nearest future to have his own family.\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Shahnoza is 29-years old and married with one young child. For more than five years, Shahnoza has been running her own business. She has a small saloon where she sells and rents both traditional and national wedding dresses. Traditionally families in Tajikistan are large so consequently there are lots of marriages and Shahnoza has a lot of clients. The stability of her business allows her to make a considerable contribution to the family income. This is her third loan with Kiva partner IMON International. During the previous loan cycle she was accurate and precise in the loan payments. Shahnoza is requesting 5,000 Somoni ($1150 USD) to purchase newer styles of wedding dresses. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She received an industrial injury and two of her fingers were cut off. She no longer was able to continue her work at the complex and had to quit.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, by profession she was a seamstress. So, one day when she was sitting at home, an acquaintance of hers asked her to tailor a trousseau for her daughter and paid her quite a decent sum. Alymbubu thought it over and decided to start sewing as a business.\r\n\r\nNow, Alymbubu provides all sewing services: traditional bedding, blankets and pillows. She has constant orders from local villagers and sometimes distributes her products to sales outlets. She makes $140 a month, though she had only $24 to start with. Besides, that her old profession and new occupation has given her an opportunity to give her children an education, to buy convenience goods for her home and, most importantly, it has given her an assurance for tomorrow and belief in herself.\r\n\r\nAlymbubu needs a loan to purchase fabric and thread for the upcoming wedding season.\r\n\r\nAlymbubu\u2019s partners are: Ryskul, Jyldyz and Ainash.\r\n\r\nRyskul, 34, is the mother of six children. She grows clover, sells barley and milk, and soon will be collecting crops from sugar beet. She needs a loan to pay for labor, transportation and the pressing of clover. She also needs to buy clothes for her kids for the new academic year.\r\n\r\nJyldyz, 35, is married and has two children. She provides tailoring services to local people and other customers. She used to be a teacher but the salary was very low and she decided to start sewing. Now, she needs a loan to purchase fabric for sewing pillows.\r\n\r\nAinash, 51, has raised five children. Currently, she looks after a piece of land and is engaged in the raising and sale of sheep. She needs a loan to buy five sheep to raise. Her dream is to increase her sheep population, sell them and use the proceeds to marry her daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Going forward, she will make her payments using the rental fees she receives on a daily basis.\r\n<p> \r\nShe hopes to revive her grocery store using the loans that have been provided to her, so that she can earn more income and improve her living conditions.\r\n<p>\r\nXiomara Antonia G. recently joined the group and operates a barber shop out of her home.  Do\u00f1a Xiomara M. sells all kinds of candy, drinks, and other foods from her vending kiosk.  They all want to use their loans to help them succeed.  The group is very reliable, punctual, and has never failed to make their payments.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Her plans for her family are to eventually buy some land and build her own house, as she is currently living with her mother.  She has been selling fruits and vegetables for 3 years, which she began with her own savings and now with loans for supplying the general public. The main difficulty that presents itself is the lack of financing.

When the company she worked for closed in 1991, she had no choice but to look for another source of income to proviD. economic stability for her family. With a young child at home, her husband's income was not sufficient to cover their expenses. <p>Gloria opened a business in the home of her mother, who supported her in this initiative. At first she simply sold items through the window. Ice cream treats were her first products, stored in Styrofoam coolers with dry ice because she had no freezer. Later, she was able to offer a wider range of items, and she converted the siD. area of her house into a small grocery store. <p>Gloria also received training in pastry making, with the dream of someday turning her business into a \"Panader\u00eda & Pasteler\u00eda Fina,\" a bakery offering high-quality bread, cakes and pastries. Currently, in addition to working in her shop, she offers custom-maD. cakes for all types of events: 15th-birthday celebrations, weddings, etc. She also provides advisory services to help people order buffet food and other needed items. This is her true passion, and she hopes one day to fulfill it, \"but in the end, above all, it's a question of effort, right?\" she says, concluding the interview with the smile of someone who knows that a dream combined with action can become reality. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3650,"image":{"id":377881,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"PURCHASE OF MERCHANDISE: SNACKS, TOILET TISSUE, AND GENERAL GROCERY ITEMS TO STOCK HER STORE","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-09-02T18:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valeriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deyssy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teofila Eusebia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Nora Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Gloria Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":3650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":912.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":912.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":912.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":912.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":912.5,"local_amount":2750,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2751.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87027506,"comment":null},{"amount":912.5,"local_amount":2750,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2751.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939332,"comment":null},{"amount":912.5,"local_amount":2750,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2751.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780172,"comment":null},{"amount":912.5,"local_amount":2750,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2751.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669039,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-09-23T05:00:08Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":132675,"name":"Roxana","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Roxana, es natural de la provincia de Chumbivilcas, zona bell\u00edsima y de granjeros y ganaderos, ella se mud\u00f3 a la provincia de Urubamba por que vio m\u00e1s oportunidades de trabajo.\n\nLa socia tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad y es conviviente ella tienen 2 hijos y a\u00fan son peque\u00f1os, los cuales le demandan mucho cuidado y esfuerzo, ella alterna sus actividades del hogar con el comercio minorista, ella tienen un peque\u00f1o stand en el mercado central modelo de Urubamba y vende juguetes, ella solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para poder comprar mayor mercader\u00eda de la ciudad de Lima y traer a su stand y seguir con su peque\u00f1o negocio, ella sue\u00f1a con expandir su negocio y verlo pronto como una galer\u00eda.\n\nLa socia agradece el apoyo brindado y se compromete a cumplir con el pago de su deuda en el plazo establecido.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":377891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Comprar juguetes al por mayor.\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urubamba -
