She is married with three sons and one daughter. She lives in Rafah city, Gaza, Palestine. Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. He also works as a taxi driver after hours. Suzan's husband has a taxi that provides income for the family's living expenses. This taxi needs a new engine to work more efficiently. Suzan wants to share this expense with her husband and take a loan of $1,896.50 from FATEN. When Suzan takes the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, her husband will be able to purchase a new engine and work extra hours to increase the family income and improve their living conditions. Suzan is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead next to the taxi. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She lives with her husband and their children in the town of Sikasso (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Anta started trading in clothing 20 years ago, after several failed business ventures. She sells clothes in her local district and surrounding towns, and is much in demand due to the high quality of her products. She decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution about a year ago in order to be able to satisfy increasing customer demand. She is now requesting a second loan from the institution, having fully repaid the previous one. She will use the money to buy 15 Pagnes Wax (traditional, sarong-like clothing) and 5 suits of embroidered fabric. She normally buys her merchandise in the town of Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso), before getting it tailored and ready for resale. She sells the clothes for cash or credit to a mixed clientele of men and women.\r\n\r\nAnta thinks she will achieve a monthly profit of around 100 000 FCFA, which will mainly be used to increase her business, contribute to her family's expenses and pay off the interest on her loan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":212.5,"image":{"id":875949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy Wax pagnes and embroidered fabrics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":20476.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699258,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":20476.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655528,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":20476.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874318,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":20476.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283141,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":20476.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424652,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-01T21:14:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":338277,"name":"Juan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juan, age 24, always seems to succeed in every move he makes in his business.

He did not have the opportunity to attend school. At a very young age he took an interest in income generating activities, in particular buying, storing and selling cereals. He learnt this activity from his uncle on his mother's side who used to be a great cereal merchant.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy his ever increasing clientele, Salif Zan decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. After having paid off his second loan on schedule, he applies for his third individual loan which he will use to buy 5 tons of cereals (corn, beans, millet and fonio) from farmers in Sougoula and nearby villages. He will store the cereals for at least three months. He usually sells wholesale to merchants in the large cities, such as Bamako.\r\n\r\nSalif Zan expects to make an average profit of 75,000 CFA francs a month, which will be used to pay off the loan. Any money left over will be reinvested in his business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":283.33,"image":{"id":876022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T19:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salif Zan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":136508.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874326,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-06T20:45:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":338333,"name":"Meriam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meriam is 50 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Its members live in the urban slums surrounding Santo Domingo,  where running water is non-potable and electricity is unreliable. She is excited to be taking out her seventh loan in four years from Esperanza, because these loans have allowed her to buy more rice to sell to her customers. In the Dominican Republic, rice is often the day's main meal, which is why Yrene went into business buying rice wholesale and selling it in small bags, sometimes on credit.

She has been selling tortillas for two years.  She learned this trade 12 years ago when she worked with somebody else who taught her.\r\n\r\nAna saw the opportunity to have her own business and thereby make better income for her family.  Ana gets up every day at 4.00am and goes to buy the corn that she needs to make her tortillas the following day.  Once she has bought the corn, she travels to her business which is located in the market.  In order to get to her place of work, she has to travel approximately two kilometers on the flat-bed of a pick-up truck.  She works all day, sometimes more than 12 hours, then returns home at 6.00pm to cook her corn for the next day.\r\n\r\nAna is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy a larger quantity of corn.  She currently has to buy her corn every day.  With this loan, she will be able to buy all the corn she needs for the week on Sunday when she can buy it at a better price.  This will save her both time and money.
