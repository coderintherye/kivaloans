Some of these members were members of other communal banks before.\r\n<p>\r\nThe associates start to save with an initial deposit of 100, 150, or 200 soles. They then receive a loan which will be invested in their business. The associates work in different types of businesses such as: selling chicken, groceries, fish, cattle, meat, ice cream, bread, food, weaving, and transportation.\r\n<p>\r\nEach associate has a different history that they can tell. One example is Liz, who has a small grocery store. She started with only a small amount of capital; with this loan, she will be able to expand her business. On the other hand, Maura is an artisan. She weaves beautiful tapestries and wall hangings. She learned this art from her parents when she was very young. Maura was invited to join this bank by her sister who is a member of another communal bank. Maura hopes to export her tapestries and constantly innovate her art. Meanwhile, Haydee makes ice cream. She started her business with a manual machine; with her savings, she was able to buy an automatic ice cream maker.\r\n<p>\r\nThe associates need loans of different sizes. Some need 300, 450, or 600 soles reaching a total of 6000 soles in loans from the communal bank. (1USD = almost 3 Peruvian soles). They will invest these loans in buying things such as sugar, milk, beans, rice, fish, soap, flower, butter, animals, wood, and dyes which are necessary for their businesses. Their dreams are to have their own land, house, or business, and for their children to be professionals and improve their economic standing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":112075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"The associates will invest these loans in buying things such as sugar, milk, beans, rice, fish, soap, flower, butter, animals, wood, and dyes which are necessary for their businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-01-09T17:45:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noemi Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolas Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Liz Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cipriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-23T22:08:57Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":338,"local_amount":1001.48,"processed_date":"2008-02-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140847,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":338,"local_amount":1001.48,"processed_date":"2008-03-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164488,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":338,"local_amount":1001.48,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189568,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":338,"local_amount":1001.48,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217627,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":338,"local_amount":1001.48,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246588,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":335,"local_amount":992.59,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":999.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":275112,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2008-01-09T22:08:57Z","paid_date":"2008-07-23T09:12:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":30651,"name":"Kak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Kak L., 25, and his wife, Mrs. Pheakdey Chhoun, 25, have been married since 2002.

Kelompok Tunas Baru terdiri dari ibu-ibu rumah tangga yang bersepakat untuk membentuk suatu kelompok yang memiliki usaha beternak babi. Mengapa diberi nama Tunas Baru? Supaya kelompok ini bisa menjadi pelopor atau contoh yang bisa tumbuh dan bisa ditiru oleh ibu-ibu lainnya yang tidak memiliki usaha dalam rumah tangganya. Setiap anggota mendapatkan pinjaman sebesar Rp.1.500.000,- yang dipergunakan sebagai modal bibit dan pakannya. Dengan modal ini setiap anggota bisa memelihara 2 ekor babi penggemukan. Setiap 1 tahun kelompok Tunas Baru bisa menjual babinya 2 kali, dijual per 6 bulan. Rata-rata keuntungan dari masing-masing anggota per panen Rp. 200,000,-. Disamping usaha ternak, kelompok Tunas Baru juga memiliki kebersamaan dalam kelompok seperti  pertemuan rutin yang diadakan setiap bulan.

Because the price of chocolate is high at Rp. 12.000,- (USD1.30) per kilogram.  Ni Nengah Darik owns a cocoa plantation of 2 hectare.  Ni Nengah Darik and her husband converted her farmland to cocoa plantation.  However, if the cocoa plants are not well maintained, the production will not be good.  Therefore Ni Nengah Darik and her husband borrowed from Dinari Rp. 3.000.000,- (USD320) to buy cocoa seeds.  The cost of each cocoa seedling is Rp. 500,- (USD0.50).  Ni Nengah Darik buys 400 seedlings at a total cost of Rp. 2.000.000,- (USD200).  The balance funding of Rp. 1.000.000,- (USD100) used for medicine because cocoa pest is vicious.  The effect of the cocoa pest destroys the fruits turning them black.  Ni Nengah Darik spray about Rp. 1.000.000,- (USD100) of medicine on the pest.  If sprayed, the cocoa fruits will be good.

Ni Nengah Darik dan suaminya tidak lagi bertani, semua sawahnya ditanami coklat. Tetapi coklat tanpa dipelihara dengan baik hasilnya tidak bagus. Oleh sebab itu Ni Nengah Darik  dan suaminya meminjam modal dari Dinari sebesar Rp. 3.000.000,- untuk membeli bibit coklat. Harga satu pohon bibit coklat Rp.500,-. Ni Nengah Darik membeli bibit coklat 400 pohon dengan harga keseluruhan Rp. 2.000.000,-. Sisa modal Rp.1.000.000,- dipakai untuk membeli obat - obatan, karena hama coklat saat ini semakin ganas. Efek sampingan yang ditimbulkan oleh hama coklat , biji coklat membatu dan busuk warnanya hitam   ( kangker coklat ). Ni Nengah Darik menghabiskan obat semprot hama coklat hampir Rp.1.000.000,-.Kalau sudah disemprot buah coklat bijinya bagus.

K. is 41 years old and has a high school education.  She is married with two children.  Kurbonoy sells national fabrics, scarves, women's shoes, and other goods.  She has been in business for seven years.  She rents a trading point called \"Tidjorat\" at Yavan's central market.\r\n\r\nShe plans to use her loan to buy more inventory, specifically new headscarves, which are worn by local residents, and also new fabric for sewing the national dress.  This loan will help local women obtain their necessary headwear and cloth, since the majority of women in this region wear the national dress.  Kurbonoy plans to repay her loan within 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0438\u0432\u0430

H., who is 52, has high school education, is married and has 6 children. Amonullo has been in the business of selling fuels and lubricants in his home village Havobod during the past 15 years. Since the oil prices are on the rise, he is planning to purchase a large amount of fuels and lubricants for future sales. Because during the winter months in the most distant areas of the village, the electricity is only available for a few hours, residents are using kerosine lamps for that purpose. This loan will give local people an opportunity to purchase benzine and kerosine for lighting and heating of their houses. Amonullo is planning to repay his loan over the next 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0425\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432

With startup funding of $110, Ni Made S. opened a kiosk selling snacks and soft drinks.  She bought small racks, thermos flasks and various snacks and drinks.  Because her location is close to the village primary school, there are many school kids that buys her products.

Besides that the loan will be used to increase offering variety such as instant noodle and meatballs that her clients often requested.

Hal ini tidak berlaku bagi Ni Made S..

Modal itu ia belikan sebuah rak kecil, gelas, termos es, aneka kue dan minuman ringan. Karena lokasinya dekat dengan Sekolah Dasar, banyak anak \u2013 anak yang berbelanja diwarungnya sehingga dalam sehari Ni Made S. bisa mendapat keuntungan Rp. 25.000.-\r\nSaat ini Ni Made S. memohon pinjaman sebesar Rp. 5.000.000.- di Yayasan Dinari. Dana ini akan ia gunakan untuk memperbaiki warungnya, karena yang saat ini kondisinya kurang baik dan belum ada dindingnya. Selain itu, dana tersebut akan digunakan untuk menambah fasilitas warung berupa mie instant dan bakso sesuai permintaan dari pelanggannya. Dengan kondisi warung yang lebih baik dan hyeginis serta fasilitas warung yang ditambah, Ni Made S. yakin usahanya akan berkembang lebih

These cacao nuts are then sold to wholesalers that comes to her home once a week.  At this time, dry cacao trades at $1.20 to $ 1.45 per kilograms.  Ni Wayan Warni can get profit of up to 5 to 11 cents per kilogram.  In one transaction Ni Wayan Warni can purchase 100 kg Cacao nuts and resell it to the wholesaler.

Saat ini banyak pembeli biji kakao keliling yang membeli kakao langsung ke petani. Memang petani sekarang ini banyak menanami sawahnya dengan pohon kakao karena perawatannya mudah dan cepat mendapat hasil. Karena tidak ingin bersaing dengan pedagang keliling yang lain, Ni Wayan Y. melihat peluang ini untuk menekuni usaha Pengepul Biji Kakao.\r\nDengan modal pinjaman dari Dinari, Ni Made Y. menggunakannya untuk membeli timbangan dan biji kakao dari pedagang keliling. Biji kakao ini akan dijual kembali kepada pedagang besar yang datang ke rumahnya seminggu sekali. Saat ini biji kakao kering berharga Rp. 11.000.- sampai dengan Rp. 13.000.- per kilogram. Ni Made Y. bisa mendapat keuntungan sebesar Rp. 500.- sampai dengan Rp. 1.000.- per kilogram. Dalam satu transaksi, Ni Wayan Y. bisa membeli 100 kilogram biji kakao dan menjualnya kembali ke pedagang besar.

I, on my behalf, request loans for few other women who are: Nasreen B., who needs a loan for their used items trading; Asiah B., who supples candies and toffees to various shops in the city and needs a loan to improve their business;  Salma B., who requires a loan for their cloth business; Rizwana B., who will invest their loan in their restaurant."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":113152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"Expand our current shoe repairing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Kot Radha Kishan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.1725 74.099722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2008-01-11T22:35:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haneefan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nasreen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asiah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rizwana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-26T03:59:02Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":97000,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":8083.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":8083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":130,"local_amount":8135.48,"processed_date":"2008-02-26T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":8145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":142556,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":130,"local_amount":8135.48,"processed_date":"2008-03-26T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":8145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166517,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":130,"local_amount":8135.48,"processed_date":"2008-04-26T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":192277,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":130,"local_amount":8135.48,"processed_date":"2008-05-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":8145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":219947,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":130,"local_amount":8135.48,"processed_date":"2008-06-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:59:33Z","rounded_local_amount":8145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":249076,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":130,"local_amount":8135.48,"processed_date":"2008-07-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T22:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":8145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277726,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":130,"local_amount":8135.48,"processed_date":"2008-08-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T22:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":8145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":307186,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":130,"local_amount":8135.48,"processed_date":"2008-09-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-27T07:07:57Z","rounded_local_amount":8145.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":338241,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":123,"local_amount":7697.42,"processed_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":7707.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":371682,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Asasah, a partner of Save the Children -

Because they lack tangible collateral assets, women are considered not creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low income. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through <i><b>Micro Leasing<\/b><\/i> as a practical way to achieve economic and social emancipation of women. SELFINA buys equipment and leases it to women. When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from her, extending her a loan, and then leases the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called \"sale and leaseback\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":113308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase shoes for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-01-12T04:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-26T14:47:12Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61,"local_amount":67310.34,"processed_date":"2008-02-26T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":69411.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":142755,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":61,"local_amount":67310.34,"processed_date":"2008-03-26T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":69411.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166737,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":61,"local_amount":67310.34,"processed_date":"2008-04-26T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":69411.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":192530,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":61,"local_amount":67310.34,"processed_date":"2008-05-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:04Z","rounded_local_amount":69411.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":220225,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":61,"local_amount":67310.34,"processed_date":"2008-06-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":69411.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":249396,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":61,"local_amount":67310.34,"processed_date":"2008-07-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":69411.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":278058,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":61,"local_amount":67310.34,"processed_date":"2008-08-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":69411.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":307543,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":61,"local_amount":67310.34,"processed_date":"2008-09-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-11T07:12:44Z","rounded_local_amount":69411.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":338628,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":56,"local_amount":61793.1,"processed_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":63722.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372305,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Sero Lease and Finance Ltd.
