D. is thirty eight years old. She is a wife and the mother of two children who are currently in school. \r\n<p>\r\nEsther believes in hard work and dedication. She is very serious in her business efforts.

The business has been very helpful to her family. \r\n<p>\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy a larger supply of maize and eggs to serve her customers throughout the season.

He is married and has 3 children: a 10-year-old boy, a 6-year-old girl and a 1-year-old baby boy. The two oldest are already in school.\r\n<p>\r\nArsenio didn\u2019t complete secondary school. When he was attending 10th grade his parents divorced and the following financial difficult situation didn\u2019t allow him to continue in school. His mother and 5 siblings moved to Boane, a village 30Km away from Maputo, but Arsenio stayed in Maputo to work. Arsenio worked for a few years as an administrative officer in a company and than 4 years for an international company. In partnership with the local company, Mozal, they would build houses and offices in the outskirts of Maputo. In 2005 his contract was over and Arsenio was dismissed from work, so he decided to move to Boane and start his own business.\r\n<p>\r\nArsenio has a small general store in Massaca, a neighborhood of Boane, where he sells mainly drinks. Beer is sold for MTn 22, soft drinks for MTn 10 and wines between MTn 35 and MTn 80. With the store Arsenio makes at least MTn 800 per day, but in the end of the month he can sell up to MTn 2,000 in one single day. Arsenio decided to rent the house he build in Boane for MTn 1,500 per month and rent a smaller house in Massaca for his family, paying only MTn 500 per month and increasing the household income. \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Arsenio\u2019s third loan with Hluvuku. The first and second loans of MTn 11,000 and MTn 14,000, respectively, were used to raise chickens and build the store. Arsenio decided to stop raising chickens and have the store because the chicken business was not going very well, as many chicks would die before reaching maturity. This MTn 18,000 will be used to buy merchandise and increase the store\u2019s inventory. Arsenio intends to diversify and start to sell food and basic needs products at the store as well. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Arsenio would like to buy a car, as transport is the most difficult part of his work. Today he has to pay around MTn 800 each time he goes to Maputo to buy merchandise."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":161388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Simiao has been married since 1997 and has 4 children. The 3 oldest children of 12, 9, and 6 years already go to school. On top of supporting his family, Simiao helps his mother; his father passed away a couple of years ago.<p>\r\n\r\nSimiao studied until 4th grade and stopped due to his family\u2019s difficult financial situation. With 6 siblings, his parents couldn\u2019t afford all of them in school. Simiao started to work at an agriculture company with pulverization, and learned how to work in the field. His father had 2 \u201cmachambas\u201d (small agriculture fields), and he dreamed of having his own machamba as well. In 2001, after more than 7 years working for 2 different companies, Simiao was able to save enough to buy 2 machambas for MTn 32,000 and MTn 35,000.<p> \r\n\r\nToday Simiao works at the 4 machambas (his father left him the fields when he passed away) and employs 6 workers. Each machamba has 80x80 meters and is irrigated by water. Simiao plants cabbage lettuce, beans, and cucumbers. The most profitable vegetable is the cabbage, although it is the longest to harvest (3 months). Simiao sells each cabbage for MTn 17 and has some of the largest supermarkets in the region as customers. Simiao pays MTn 1,000 per month for water, MTn 1,150 for a bag of fertilizer, and MTn 1,050 for a bag of the compost, and he uses normally 5 bags of each per month. The largest difficulty of the business is the inconsistency in prices (sometimes it falls dramatically) and the transport, as Simiao does not have a car to transport his vegetables.<p>\r\n\r\nThis will be Simiao's first loan with Hluvuku. He has never asked for a loan before, and he decided to approach Hluvuku after seeing his colleague improve his machamba. This MTn 12,000 will be used to buy fertilizer and compost and will help speed up the new harvest. In the future Simiao would like to buy a larger machamba in Namaacha, a close-by district, where he would plant more cabbage and increase his monthly income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":161394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy

Antonio is divorced and has a 4-year-old boy. His wife got sick in Boane (a village in the Province of Maputo, 30 km away from the capital) and decided to have a traditional treatment at her parents\u2019 house in Cabo Delgado. She decided not to come back and to keep the boy, even though Antonio really wanted to take care of his son.<p>\r\n\r\nWhen Antonio was finishing 7th grade in Cabo Delgado, his mother passed away and he failed in school. The following difficult financial situation didn\u2019t allow him to continue his studies. In 1999 Antonio moved to Cuamba to work as a guard and construction worker at the house his sister was building, and he had the opportunity to attend 8th, 9th, and 10th grades. As Antonio is a very dedicated student, he learned English very well and had the opportunity to work at a South African company that built roads. In 2004 Antonio moved to Boane to live with another sister and work at her small stand selling used clothes. <p>\r\n\r\nSoon after, his sister moved to Beira and left him in Boane to take care of the stand. After a small amount of marketing research, Antonio decided to close his sister\u2019s stand and open a stand at the bus and mini-bus final stop selling used shoes and socks. He was the first person to sell socks in Boane and therefore built a very strong customer base. Antonio buys the merchandise in a large warehouse in Maputo every other week. He buys closed packages that contain between 90 to 120 pairs of shoes. There are 3 types of packages: mixed shoes (MTn 2,700), sports shoes (MTn 7,000), and female shoes (MTn 2,500). Antonio cannot see what is inside each package, but lately he has been quite lucky. If he can get a good sport pair of shoes size 8\/9, he can sell them easily for MTn 700. And demand is high! <p>Sometimes Antonio gets shoes that are too old and not in a condition to resell. Antonio makes at least MTn 1,000 per day, and during the end of the month he makes up to MTn 6,000 in a single day. He has a small safe at his house where he deposits at least MTn 100 every day. That is a way of saving and making sure he has money to pay his duties. Antonio\u2019s expenses are small: he rents a small room for MTn 250 per month and pays for energy and his food, besides sending money to his kid.<p>\r\n\r\nThis will be Antonio\u2019s fourth loan with Hluvuku. The first MTn 5,000 was used to buy merchandise, and he repaid it in just 2 months. The second MTn 8,000 he used to buy a refrigerator and a sofa and paid it back in 4 months. With the third MTn 11,000 Antonio had to change his plan of only buying merchandise and used part of the money to pay his uncle\u2019s medication expenses in Cabo Delgado, as he got very sick. This MTn 15,000 will be used to buy merchandise and repair his secondhand motorcycle that is not working. Antonio wants to increase his stand inventory and attract more clients.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Antonio would like to go back to school and at least finish his secondary degree. He loves studying and dreams of one day going to university. Antonio would also like to expand his business and build a proper store where he would be able to employ people who have the same difficulties in life that he faced. He would like to sell food as well, guaranteeing steady sales during the whole month, and not only big sales at the end of the months. With his hardworking attitude and good business sense, Antonio will definitely succeed in his business and life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":161412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase

She is married and has 5 children. Her two oldest children live in Swaziland with their father and are attending university and the three smaller children live with her and go to school in Boane. Teresa studied until 5th grade and stopped due to her family\u2019s difficult financial situation. She moved with her family to Boane, a village 30Km away from the capital city Maputo, a long time ago. Teresa has had a small stand in front of her house since 1983, at which she sells ice creams, soft drinks and basic needs products. \r\n<p>\r\nAs her stand's business is quite unstable, she decided to start rearing chickens 3 years ago and has been successful so far. Teresa built a quite large henhouse in her backyard, where she now raises 1,000 chicks at a time. She buys the chicks and chicken feed in Maputo and pays someone to bring them to her house. After a 30-day maturity period Teresa sells each chicken for MTn 85. Clients normally go to her henhouse directly to buy chickens, but she sometimes transports them to the village center as well. Teresa counts on the help of her older daughter to run the stand, and they make between MTn 500 to MTn 1,000 per day. Teresa\u2019s husband is a policeman and also helps with the house\u2019s expenses and with the children\u2019s school fees.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Teresa\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. She will use the MTn 20,000 to buy chickens, chicken feed and vaccines in large quantity to stock. She heard about Hluvuku and decided to ask for this loan, as she wants to improve her business. In future Teresa would like to build a new general store to sell food and other

is 47 years old and originally from Mozambique's capital city, Maputo. Alfredo is married with 3 children, who all live and study in Xai-Xai, in the Gaza Province. On top of supporting his wife and children, Alfredo helps his mother, in-laws and also a few other members of the family.\r\n<p>\r\nAlfredo completed secondary school and has been a teacher since 1985. He currently teaches at the Instituto Pedagogico of Boane daily from 7:00am to 10:30pm and earns a monthly salary of MTn 5,000. His salary will be increased by 11% next month due to the government's annual salary adjustment. Alfredo is an endless learner and dreams of attaining a master degree one day. He is currently in his second year at the University of Maputo, pursuing a Biology degree. Alfredo studies from 12:30pm to 5:20pm daily and takes a public transport of 40min to Maputo (30Km away from Boane). Alfredo explained that the university fees are dependent on the person\u2019s capacity to pay and profession. With Alfredo\u2019s base salary and teacher\u2019s diploma he pays only MTn 100 per subject at university. This semester Alfredo is taking 5 different subjects. \r\n<p>\r\nAs the government provides housing for teachers, Alfredo has always lived in the school at which he teaches. He has been living at the Instituto for more than 10 years now. Alfredo\u2019s dream is to build his own house and provide comfort for his family. He is almost there. With this first loan of MTn 18,500 Alfredo will buy aluminum-roofing, cement to finish the floor and install some missing windows. Alfredo estimates that one or two more loans will be necessary to finish the house and move in. He heard about Hluvuku during a conversation with some colleagues who advised him to approach the institution after hearing him complain about the slow progress of his house\u2019s construction.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Alfredo would like to build a small henhouse in his backyard where he will be able to raise chickens and have a steady business, already planning for retirement when the day comes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":161526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","use":"Buy

She worked for many years selling items such as firewood, used clothes and basic needs products in her house and by the road. Two years ago, Preselina was hired by a local company producing chicken meat. The company has 14 large henhouses, each with 10,000 chicks. Preselina is responsible for one henhouse, feeding the chickens and making sure they are ready within 30 days.

She is quite happy with the house, as it has water and energy supplies, is close to the road that connects to Maputo and to a local school.

Preselina has taken out previous loans with Tchuma, another local microfinance institution that provides group loans. However, she prefers Hluvuku because she can ask for a higher individual loan.

is 35 years old and originally from the Inhambane Province. Carlos is married and has 3 children: the oldest, a daughter aged 17, lives with her mother while the 2 youngest (7-year-old and 5-year-old) live with Carlos and attend school. Carlos studied until 7th grade. He was approved at a professional school to become a teacher but wasn\u2019t able to attend due to his father\u2019s difficult financial situation. I\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1993 Carlos started work as a barman at a hotel in Matola, in the Maputo Province. After 4 years he left as he wasn\u2019t able to survive on his monthly salary of MTn 590 (around US$24). Therefore, Carlos started his own business selling used clothes and shoes and then switching to construction material. Today Carlos has a small store in Matola where he sells cement and also rents a store in Boane where he sells cement and roof joists. \r\n<p>\r\nCarlos buys the merchandize in the capital city of Maputo (20Km away from Matola and 30Km away from Boane). Cement costs MTn 220 and roof joists MTn 150 -- Carlos sells them for MTn 230 and MTn 200, respectively. Even though roof joists have higher profit margins,  Carlos also sells cement beucase it is a faster and guaranteed business, as there is high demand for it. Carlos sells around 150 roof joists per month at the store in Boane\u2019s, but sometimes finds it difficult to retain long term customers. \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Carlos\u2019 first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. During a conversation with a couple of friends he mentioned the lack of working capital to buy inventory and they directed him to Hluvuku. His loan of MTn 14,500 will be used to buy cement and wood in bulk, potentially at a discount. Carlos hopes to increase sales and attract more loyal clients. In the future Carlos would like to build a house in Inhambane. He already has a house in Matola, but would like to have a house in Inhumbane to be close to his

Francisco is married and has 5 children. All children are currently attending school.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1971, Francisco moved to Boane, a village 30Km away from the capital city Maputo, with his family. He studied until 8th grade and stopped because of financial and transportation difficulties. The secondary school was located in Maputo and public buses or mini-buses were almost inexistent and very expensive. Francisco started to work with his father, a goldsmith. Francisco and his father used to buy raw materials in Maputo, but with the Mozambican civil war, they started buying in the north of the country instead, which increased their production costs.\r\n<p>\r\nToday Francisco has a small store in Boane where he sells his jewellery as well as clothes. Francisco makes earrings, rings and necklace with red gold, the local available raw material.  Francisco buys the gold in Maputo at MTn 600 per gram. Earrings are his most popular products and are sold for MTn 250 to MTn 2,500. Francisco\u2019s wife works at the store and they make between MTn 3,000 to MTn 6,000 per day.

The first MTn 10,000 was used to buy raw materials to work as a goldsmith. The second loan of MTn 30,000 was used to start a wood business that didn\u2019t work out. Francisco planned to buy wood in the north of the country and sell in Maputo, but as he was new to the business he didn\u2019t forecast all the difficulties and failed. This third loan of MTn 12,000 will again be used to buy raw material (mainly gold), so that Francisco can produce many products to sell. He would like to increase his store\u2019s inventory to attract more clients and increase his monthly income.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Francisco would like to have a gold manufacturing company,

Zacarias","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicente is 23 years old and originally from the Gaza Province. He is single and has no children. In 1991, Vicente and his family moved to Boane, a village 30Km away from the capital city Maputo, because of the Mozambican civil war. In 1999 Vicente lost his parents in an accident and has ever since supported his 3 sisters. He lives in his late father\u2019s house and supports his 2 younger sisters who are still in school. His older sister already works, but barely makes her own living.\r\n<p>\r\nVicente studied until 10th grade and then did a professional course of 2 years to become a teacher. Since 2004 Vicente has been working as a teacher, currently teaching Portuguese and music to 6th and 7th graders. Vicente works from 12:00pm to 17:20pm and earns a monthly salary of MTn 4,500. The government adjusts the salary every year, and this time it will be increased by 11%.    \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Vicente\u2019s third loan with Hluvuku and first with Kiva. The first loan of MTn 5,500, in May 2007, was used to install energy in his house and pay the initial contract with the state-owned energy company. The second MTn 4,000 was used to help him pay for his graduation from the professional course to become a teacher. This time Vicente plans to use the MTN 11,500 to buy construction materials, such as cement and sand, to repair his house. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore he took the first loan he approached a few other institutions such as the local bank, but preferred Hluvuku because it offered the flexibility to pay as much as he could each month, and over a longer period. Vicente is very grateful for Hluvuku\u2019s loans, as he has really felt a positive impact on his life after the loans.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Vicente would like to go to university. He tried to enter this year, but was not accepted after sitting for the entrance annual exam. He will try again next year, as he dreams of studying psychology. Vicente would like to structure his life before forming a family, so that he can provide better for his children than his parents were able to provide."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":161534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

M. is a 30 year old man, he is married and has 3 children.  His wife sells fruits at the market.  Djamshed works as a driver for the public transport firm \u2013 Gazel.  After the cold winter he would like to make major repairs to his car.  He needs 3000 somoni in order to do this.  This is why he decided to turn to MicroInvest.  Djamshed thinks that the loan makes good sense for him.
