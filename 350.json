En el barrio Bellavista de Malambo, municipio ubicado en el \u00e1rea metropolitana de Barranquilla, todos la conocen porque tiene este negocio que inicio, cuando le llevaban la tela, tomaba medidas, dise\u00f1aba y elaboraba la ropa de acuerdo a lo solicitado y que fue creciendo tanto, que empez\u00f3 a fabricar por tallas y a comercializar en las poblaciones del Departamento del Atl\u00e1ntico. Ella ha pasado por muchas dificultades familiares, pero siempre se ha sobrepuesto y le han servido para mejorar; as\u00ed Fu\u00e8 cuando se separo de su esposo y se mudo sola a Medell\u00edn, ciudad de Colombia reconocida por sus pasarelas de elegancia, glamour y sensibilidad de modistos y dise\u00f1adores colombianos e internacionales; all\u00ec fu\u00e8 donde perfeccion\u00f3 su arte, pues trabajo desde su negocio para dise\u00f1adores de ferias internacionales realizadas en esa ciudad, y pudo, mediante un cr\u00e9dito del estado, reiniciar su negocio e intentar regresar por sus hijos a Malambo, decisi\u00f2n que no concreto porque fue favorecida por subsidios del programa de Familias en Acci\u00f3n del estado y por eso  hace 6 anos, se estableci\u00f2 en esta poblaci\u00f3n para desde all\u00ed apoyar los estudios de sus hijos sin interrumpirlos. \n\nAracelys ingres\u00f3 a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo con el programa de grupos solidarios en el a\u00f1o 1995 y recibi\u00f3 5 cr\u00e9ditos antes de que algunas compa\u00f1eras del grupo empezaran a trabajar en empresas, ella misma cambiara de ciudad y este grupo se desintegrara;  cuando ella regres\u00f2 de Medell\u00edn, encontr\u00f3 nuevamente el apoyo de la Fundaci\u00f3n, adquiri\u00f3 una fileteadora y comenz\u00f3 a trabajar para terceros.

She is an authentic female head of household who has always participated in productive, reproductive, educational, domestic and community activities to acheive a better future for her 5 children. In the Bellavista de Malambo neighborhood, a town located in the metropolitan area of Baranquilla, everyone knows her. When she started this business, they would take her the fabric, she'd take measurements, and she would design and make the clothing according to what they had ordered. It grew so much that she started to make clothes in sizes and sell them in the towns of the Atlantico Department. She has gone through many family hardships but she has always overcome and they have improved her. That is what happened when she separated from her husband and moved alone to Medellin, a city in Colombia known for its elegant runways, its glamour, and the sense of its Colombian stylists and designers.   She was able, with a state credit, to begin her business again, and try to return for her children to Malambo. This decision didn't happen because she was favored by the Families in Action program of the state and that is why, 6 years ago, she established herself in this town to support her children's studies from there without interruptions.  \r\n\r\nAracelys entered the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo with the support groups programs in 1995 and she received 5 loans before some of the other members of the group started to work in businesses, she herself changed towns, and the group began to disintegrate.  When she returned to Medellin, she again found the support of the Fundaci\u00f3n. She acquired a sewing machine and started to work for others. For 2 years she sewed for a clothing wholesaler in a small factory.  Now she does it for a chain of stores that has supplied her with a 2 needle machine, but she must pay rent for the pieces and the work exclusivity. This activity does not make her a lot of money. This is the reason she is asking for a loan of $2.300.000  which she will invest in the purchase of an industrial machine. This will be in order to sew with heavy fabrics, such as denim, and to be able to keep for herself what she pays in rent.  \r\n\r\nAracelys Mar\u00eda dreams of acquiring her own label, having better housing, and finishing her children's education. Her biggest challenge is organizing a complete infrastructure to pracrice her art and help in the education of her children without her husband's income. This is why she doubles her efforts and at the same time sells cosmetic merchandise. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

P., age 37, lives in the Gal\u00e1n neighborhood in the city of Barranquilla.  She is separated and has a 15 year old son.  She now lives at home with her family, where they sell lunches and cold drinks.  It is a family business.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan for 2,000,000 COP to buy drinks, refreshments, and supplies for food that she makes during special times like Carnaval.  This is when neighborhood families organize a party in the street and have fun safely.\r\n\r\nThey started the business selling bananas and vegetables in the entrance of a supermarket.  She sold the place because they started paving that affected their sales.  She then went to the market in Barranquilla where she established her business of selling economical lunches liked stuffed potatoes, rice with chicken or dried fish, rice wrapped in a leaf with meat, chicken, egg, and vegetables.  As they are now restructuring the market, she moved again in order to set up the family business in a stable place.  They sell lunches, refreshments, and everything having to do with fried food from her father\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nBesides her business of selling food, Sandra learned how to use industrial sewing machines in training given by Sena (National Service for Learning).  The Santo Domingo Foundation arranged for her to take the course, and she achieved a higher level of efficiency on the machines.  She also took a business course, and she realized that it would be very expensive to buy the industrial sewing machines and set up all of the structure to launch a business.  That is why she does not have her own seamstress shop.  She dreams of one day being able to have the money that will allow her to buy the machinery to create her own clothing business.  That is why she works hard, but also happily and dynamically.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Because he does not have his own home, he lives together with his wife and his 12-year-old daughter in his neighborhood's soup kitchen.\r\n\r\nHe is a multi-faceted person who carries out a range of activities, including driver, welder and salesman. He does all of this to obtain additional income, but his main business is selling cheese. The product he sells comes from the city of Huancayo (in Peru's central highlands), where he was born. The cheese from Huancayo is very delicious, and so his neighbors are constantly ordering it from him. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning, he traveled to his village to buy meat and cheeses, but today he has suppliers who bring him these products at a low price. Thanks to these businesses, Guillermo has been able to educate his numerous children; however, it bothers him that he could not buy a piece of land in order to have a house of his own. However, he mentions that he still feels happy, since he has always tried to do his best for his children. \r\n\r\nThis is his 19th loan with MFP, and he is very grateful for the opportunity provided to him through these repeated loans. They have been, and continue to be, of great help to him so that he can continue operating his business.

She lives in her own home with her husband and two children.\r\n<p>\r\nMaritza sells fish and other types of seafood, with her specialties being shrimp and fillets.  She has been in business for almost eight years and finds this line of work more profitable than her previous business selling prepared food.  In order to work as a fishmonger, she has to arrive at the fishing docks at 4am because she will not be able to acquire any merchandise if she arrives any later.  Maritza enjoys her work even though she has to wake up very early.  By 6am, she begins collecting payment for the fish she has delivered.  At first she worked by herself, but she was not able to provide adequate service, so she hired a young assistant who is responsible for making deliveries.  This allows her to focus on making sure that her customers are satisfied with the products.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP.

Take the case of Zenobia, who has been married for 16 years and has 2 minor children.  Zenobia sells salchipapas (combination of sausage and French fries) at night, since she takes care of her children during the day.  This allows her to contribute to feeding her family.  She will invest the loan in commodities needed to serve her loyal customers.\r\nDavid is the group\u2019s secretary.  Seeing his family\u2019s need, he decided to set up a business that allows him to keep expenses at home.  He sews jeans, and 2 people help him.  As is true with any business, the startup was difficult, but with a lot of hard work, his business stabilized, and he now concerns himself with raising and feeding his 3 minor children.\r\nSeveral years ago, Sonia was able to buy a car along with her partner, to work in public transportation.  Although business is down at times, she forges ahead, in order to support her 3 children.\r\nThe members are grateful for support offered by Edaprospo, and those who participate in the financing, such as kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":486584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-02-18T15:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenobia Tarcila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flavia Domitila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Apolinario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obdulia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yelitza Glynis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5050,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1262.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":443.93,"local_amount":1263,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1269.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933810,"comment":null},{"amount":443.57,"local_amount":1262,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1268.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661403,"comment":null},{"amount":443.93,"local_amount":1263,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1269.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694063,"comment":null},{"amount":443.57,"local_amount":1262,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1268.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877027,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-19T18:18:02Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":175187,"name":"Yesenia Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esta se\u00f1ora es trabajadora de la Alcald\u00eda Municipal de Chichigalpa, se desempe\u00f1a como conserje del \u00e1rea de Finanzas, tiene la edad de 28 a\u00f1os, es madre soltera de 2 ni\u00f1os los cuales est\u00e1n en edad escolar.\nElla nos expreso que los cr\u00e9ditos que Ceprodel le ha otorgado han sido de mucha ayuda ya que con el primer cr\u00e9dito lo utilizo para hacerle mejoras a su vivienda donde habita con sus hijos y padres y con este \u00faltimo fue para comprarles los \u00fatiles escolares a sus hijos y para solventar otros gastos.\n\n","en":"This woman works in the municipality of Chichigalpa, where she works as a financial advisor.

She is married, 36 years old, and a mother of two children, who still depend on her.  She has a complete secondary education.\r\n\r\nSilvia is a hard-working fighting woman, which is why she decided to begin her own business selling carbonated drinks and beverages in a well-kept space located in her house.  She directs the business without having a schedule or a boss.  She told us she began her business with 250 nuevos soles and began buying 2 packages of carbonated drinks to see how it went.  When she saw that the business worked well and she did not have enough carbonated drinks, she began investing little by little in her business.\r\n\r\nShe still works in the same business and is known among her customers, who are her neighbors, family members, and friends.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of 1,500 nuevos soles, Silvia will buy more drinks like packages of carbonated drinks in different flavors, sizes, and brands as well as mineral water with and without carbonation.  She will also invest part of the money to buy ingredients for her drinks like sugar and fruits, such as oranges and other wild and natural fruits in bulk.\r\n\r\nSilvia Karina is very happy with the work she does.  Her goal is to have her own mini-market selling carbonated drinks and beverages.  She is very grateful for the Manuela Ramos Movement for helping her when she most needed it.  She is responsible with her loan repayments and she wants to continue.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":486611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"Buying carbonated drinks to expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-12T07:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":250.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954552,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":250.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987578,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":250.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713604,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":250.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746650,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":250.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929821,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":250.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159668997,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-16T00:59:16Z","paid_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":175190,"name":"Elsia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elsia tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en casa propia con sus 2 hijos, de los cuales uno de ellos esta \nen edad escolar.

The group was formed at the initiative of mothers who wanted to develop businesses, but found it difficult to secure the necessary capital to do so, as the loan application process at banks is complicated and burdensome.\r\nKWT Tiing Gading has 20 members and spans a wide range of businesses, from farming to trading to home-based businesses such as making cookies and chips. Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) Koperasi is working with Kiva to provide the necessary funding for these women to develop their businesses.\r\nKWT Tiing Gading has a leadership team that is comprisesd of three members: Ni Putu Eka Yulianti (Chairman), Ni Made Mili Kasih (Secretary) and Ni Komang Mahayani (Treasurer). \r\nOne of the borrowers, Ni Komang Mahayani, who is also the Treasurer in the leadership team, is a housewife whose tough day-to-day work is to make and supply a variety of cakes to shops or individual customers. In particular, when there are religious ceremonies approaching, cake orders will multiply as Komang Mahayani makes better and more expensive cakes than the artificial cakes and snacks sold in stores. Komang Mahayani is applying for loans through MUK, which will be used to increase her working capital. She will use the additional profit she earns to finance her children\u2019s education, as one is waiting to enter school and the other is currently attending Junior High School.\r\n\r\nNote to Kiva Lenders: This group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender. This is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner MUK will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers.  As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":486664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"As capital to develop the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-02-11T04:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang Kardi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Netri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Karseni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sayu Putu Suci","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made Sulendri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu Denis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang Sujani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made Murti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Derti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nengah Seni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made Ardani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu Eka Yulianti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made Dermi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kadek Mili Kasih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Wiryati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Suryani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang Mahayani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan Darwati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Dentri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sayu Putu Sukerti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15000000,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":15000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1600,"local_amount":15000000,"processed_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":15000000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195878553,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-11T11:13:21Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":175196,"name":"09.2.2 Nam Ngan Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ly H.

She has been managing her own variety store for two years.\r\n\r\nMaria has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT)* for more than three years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow 11 times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows as capital for her business. Her business lets her earn a profit of 23,655 Philippine pesos (PHP) per month.\r\n\r\nNow, with your help, she would like to receive a 29,000 PHP loan. This money will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business to buy assorted beverages and snacks. She dreams that her business will grow so that her children can have funding to finish their studies and be able to manage the business someday.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nora A. is from the village of San Juan. She is 49 years old. Nora is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNora is married. To make a living, Nora owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Nora has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP whenever she sells one of her raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nora joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Nora is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Nora from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 57 years old. Rebecca is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRebecca is married and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, she raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes  from raising pigs for sale. Rebecca has been engaged in her business for more than 8 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Rebecca joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rebecca has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase baby livestock to raise. Rebecca is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Rebecca from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

D\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb (20213040011) is a 42-year-old female living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, H. owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a tailoring business.  The main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing women's tailoring services to local community members.  H. has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,704,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital.  H. is now requesting a new loan of 7,840,000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital.  The loan will be the third loan taken out by H. from SEDA.  H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.

To making a living, T. owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community.  T. has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,704,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  T. is now requesting a new loan of 7,840,000 VND, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering.  The loan will be the third loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is 41 years old. Francisco is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nFrancisco is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, he plants and harvests a variety of vegetables to sell. Francisco has been engaged in his business for over fifteen years and earns approximately $155 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Francisco joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation by engaging in business activities. He is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be his 1st loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A. is a resident of Quisao, Tanay, Rizal. She is 68 years old and single. As she is reaching an older age, she is working hard on her own. She is grateful that they have an ASHI group in their village that offers her happiness and so she never feels alone in achieving her goals in life.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Ceferina is busy with her small business of buying and selling RTW (Ready To Wear) clothes just to earn the means to live every day. When she received a small amount of capital from ASHI, she managed to put it all into her business. For her, business is an important factor and she does not want to be a problem for her group mates or for the center.\r\n\r\nShe applied for a new loan amount of PHP 20,000.00 to have additional working capital for her RTW business. Specifically the loan funds will be used to buy more stock like pairs of sandals, slippers, and accessories (for all ages).\r\n\r\nCeferina is a very good member of ASHI. She performs well in her business; when she has enough capital, she adds more business in order to gain more income. She hopes to share this with her sister, Paulita, who is a 55 year old maid. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that through her loans from ASHI, in partnership with KIVA, that someday she will be able to save money for her future use because she is getting older

U. is a woman of many dreams and the heroism to fight challenges in order to achieve her dreams. She is 57 years old and married to George, 50, who is a fisherman.  She is a loving mother of an only child, King, who is 15 years old and a high school student. She lives in the town of Tanay, Rizal Province, in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, she joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with an opportunity of having startup capital for generating income. During her previous loans from ASHI, she carefully invested it in planting vegetables and a hog raising business. Both businesses gave her a reasonable income, but it was lost due to a storm last September 2009.\r\n\r\nNow on her third loan, she requests 15,000 PHP for the recovery of her planting business and to also start hog fattening. Specifically, the amount will be use for both businesses. This loan will help her business, which was destroyed by huge typhoons \u201dOndoy\u201d and \u201cSanti\u201d. \r\n\r\nAs a mother, Nenita dreams of sending her son to school and on to completing college degrees and finding jobs for a better life. She also enjoys that the loan from ASHI will change their lives and accommodate her family's needs. Through the support of ASHI, a Kiva partner, she hopes to continue reaching for her

Life here can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (assuming one has power to begin with) and inadequate health care. Despite these difficulties, Eufrecia runs a successful business selling interior decorations to her friends and neighbors.

She has high hopes and believes that by worK. hard, she will one day finish construction of her home, buy a small car and get a computer for her children. She also hopes to have many employees and take out loans of greater and greater sizes. Eufrecia has lofty dreams, and with your loan she will be well on her way to achieving them.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope.

O. is a tenacious 40 year old woman.  She has three children; 21, 18, and 11 years old.  She lives in the Nueva Jerusal\u00e9n neighborhood in the Soledad-Atl\u00e1ntico municipality.  That is where she has her business of selling varied merchandise directly and through specialized guides.  She also makes food on the week ends and for holidays.\r\n\r\nShe started as a businesswoman because she was a housewife without a life partner.  Even though she had worked previously as an employee, she decided to work on her own.  She did this in order to be able to be close to her children while raising them and to share more time with them.  Bernudis has had various businesses.  In the beginning she sold frozen chicken, and she added a restaurant to this business.  She had to close it because the fixed prices increased, and the customers stopped coming due to the increase in the price of the lunches.\r\n\r\nThat was when, five years ago, she decided to start her food business in her house in the Nuevo Jerusal\u00e9n neighborhood.  She sells \u201challacas\u201d (cornmeal, meat, and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves), pastries, and appetizers on the week ends.  She combines this with her general merchandise sales.  Her profits help her support her family.  She says that being a businesswoman has changed her life.  In addition to giving her independent income, it has given her autonomy and allowed her to buy assets.  She bought a freezer and shelving for her restaurant.\r\n\r\nShe has had four loans with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She is an outstanding client with her punctual payments.  She is currently applying a fifth time for 2,000,000 COP to buy merchandise on order; especially sheets, footwear, and cosmetics.\r\n\r\nHer main goal is to support the education of her children.  Later, when the children have been prepared, she will start a family pharmacy where she will not have to offer credit.  Even though she has learned to select her customers, she must make a greater effort with charged accounts.  Her biggest challenge is making this dream of working in a family pharmacy a reality.  She realizes that you cannot start this business with little money.  Therefore, she needs to work hard and wait a long time.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She is the coordinator for her group, Nuevo Renacer (Rebirth), and her story is representative of those in her group and other Dominican and Haitian borrowers at Esperanza International.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria is a single mother who lives with her two children in Samana, a small city in the northeastern region of the Dominican Republic. Life in the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate healthcare. Despite these difficulties, Maria runs a successful business selling home products to her friends and neighbors. With this loan, Maria will purchase sheet sets to sell to her friends and neighbors for a small profit.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Maria\u2019s eighth loan with Esperanza International, and she hopes to continue taking out loans to grow her business and improve her home life for her family. With her profits, Maria hopes to purchase a small van in order to make her business more mobile. This will add to her profits, which will allow her to improve life at home by finishing her bathroom and purchasing a computer for her children. Computers are difficult to afford, but are one of the best investments for a low-income household to make. It gives access to the world of information that those of us in the developed world take for granted while teaching children to use the invaluable tools of modern technology.

Throughout the course of her life, she has had to face difficult moments such as the separation from her husband and becoming a single mother to her children.  Maria has been selling fried foods for a number of years.  She started this business with the help of her oldest son and, with the help of financing from AFODENIC, was able to generate additional profit by offering more items on her menu.  Every afternoon, she begins selling food to the general public and is able to generate many sales because her dishes are so flavorful.  Her plans include building an enclosed porch at the back of her house so that she can provide better service to her customers.  With this loan, she plans to buy zinc, crossbeams, and nails so that she can accommodate more people and generate additional sales.  She will also move her vending post from the entrance to the back of her house where she will be able to attend to her customers better.

D. T., 57, lives in the Marchuela area of Usme, a neighborhood on the outskirts of the Colombian capital of Bogota.  She is married and has twelve children who range in age from 12 to 39.  She works with her husband selling hardware, tools, car parts, construction supplies, electrical parts and even inflatable toys.  This is her fourth Fundacion loan and the previous loans have allowed her to increase her working capital, something that she thinks has greatly contributed to her financial situation and her way of living.  She is applying for a 1,200,000-peso loan that she will use to buy tools--saws, screwdrivers, etc.--and more inflatible toys for her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nMaria Nubia is a native of the \"departamento\" of Caldas in the Eje Cafetero region of western Colombia.  She spent twenty years traveling around Colombia with her husband who worked for a carnival, both of them going from place to place, selling fun.  At the beginning of the 1990s, the family settled in Barranquilla where they bought a house and opened a shop.  For the sake of her husband's health, the family resettled in Bogota in 2008 and, happily, his health is now better.  Maria Nubia's goal is to buy a house in the capital because they had to sell their Barranquilla house.  She wants to live in the same neighborhood as the shop because there are lots of businesses nearby, it's convenient and the people are friendly.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her variety store, and recently, her computer shop.     \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like a loan of 20,000 PHP. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding businesses to buy equipment for her computer shop and groceries for her variety store.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her businesses will continue to grow so that she can enjoy her life in good health together with her family.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
