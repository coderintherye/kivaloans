There are not any factories or huge companies. However, the citizens are laborious and ambitious. Burul J., a leader of this group, is a great example to be followed. Burul is delicate woman but has really unimaginable will and strength because she went through a hard trial. Unfortunately, a few years ago her husband died. \r\n\r\nAfter the death of her husband, life seemed already cracked, and she lost heart, but the future of her daughter really forced her to go ahead. Now, Burul has a daughter who is 16. Her daughter attends a local school in Balykchy. About five years ago, she got a loan of 7,000 Kyrgyzstani som (about $156) and she opened up her business, which is located just inside the house. Since then her life became normal. Now she sells foodstuffs such as macaroni, rice, sugar, salt, oil, fizzy drinks and detergent. \r\n\r\nAt present, her net income is about 5,000 KGS (about $110). She wants to get a loan to increase the stock of foodstuffs prior to a holiday season in order to make enough earnings to buy a trade pavilion in the future. Her future plan is to give an education to her daughter, to whom she dedicated her life, and buy and place her own pavilion in her yard.\r\n\r\nNazgul K. is 38. She is married and has four children, two sons and two daughters. Her husband works as a driver in the administration of reservoir. She works as a security officer in the administration of reservoir. At present, they are increasing the number of their cattle. Their revenue is 4,000 KGS (about $90). They want to get a loan to buy young plants of apricots and apples to plant in the field. \r\n\r\nArdakbek K. is 42. He is married and has four children; two of them are sons and two are daughters. His wife is a housewife. He works as a clerk in the city hall. He inherited 20 sheep and, little by little, increased the number of sheep. Now he is just fattening them. He wants to get a loan to buy another sheep and sell them all in the future.\r\n\r\nSalima A. is 24. She has two children and a brilliant husband who works as radio operator at the station. Now they are reselling cattle. At first, they bought five of them and after fattening them, they resold them. Their revenue is 4,000 KGS (about $90).

With the tailoring, she started 21 years ago when she trained in the trade and started sewing, in addition to selling new clothes, to increase her income. She is able to make about 60,000 shillings as profits a week because of her use of the loans and hard work. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to expand her businesses further and build a house as she continues to educate her children. Anna has also joined the business of animal husbandry and she hopes her income will increase more once she stabilizes the business. She needs a loan to be able to purchase new stock for her clothes business for an increased capital base.

is 51 years old, married with one son, and lives in the province of Rizal with her husband.  To supply additional income for her family, Mercedita has been buying and selling fish for almost fifteen years. Her husband, Marceliano, is also involved in the fish-selling business and works closely with Mercedita in Rizal.\r\n\r\nMercedita would like to receive a loan to purchase additional supplies for her business, including a fish cage, bamboo, netting, and bait.  Mercedita believes these purchases will increase her fish inventory and drive increased monthly revenue.  A proud member since 1999 of Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), a Kiva micro-finance partner in the Philippines, Mercedita has been a dedicated member demonstrating regular attendance at weekly meetings and steady repayments on previous loans.\r\n\r\nHer long term goals are to maintain the profitability of her business, invest in a new home, and support the education of her son.  She hopes that he will have children one day so she can support the college education of her grandchildren.  \r\n\r\nAbout ASHI: Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) has the distinction of being the oldest existing replication of Grameen Bank Approach (GBA) to credit delivery to the bottom poor in the Philippines. With its outstanding achievements over the years, it has become one of the role models in credit delivery to the poor in the

More specifically, he lives in the district of Tonghor, which is an area very close to the sea and is inhabited primarily by fishermen. He has been a member of the U-IMCEC Yoff credit union since February 2006. He is married and has 6 children, whose ages very between 2 and 15 years. After his primary education, he took on the job of his parents, and has been involved in this activity for more than 30 years. For him, the most attractive aspect of his occupation is the realization of significant profits that allow him to provide for himself and his family. Mr. T. is seeking a loan of 200,000 FCFA with the goal of repairing his equipment and canoe. Thus, this credit will allow him to make his business more profitable, and thereby improve his family's standard of living.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

She has already profited from 11 previous loans.  She lives in Ouakam in the neighborhood of Touba, several meters from the bank.  She is married and the mother of eight children.  Her husband is a manual laborer and polygamous.  His income proves insufficient to cover all of the needs of the family.  Consequently, for over nine years she has developed a small restaurant, selling breakfast in front of her home.  Her profits allow her to support her children and take responsibility for a large part of her own personal needs.  She is asking for a loan of 100,000 frs to reinforce her business, as she plans to buy products that allow her to prepare her breakfast and back-stock these goods.  These products are sugar, peas, etc.  The loans from the institution will allow her to achieve a certain advancement in her business and a certain social stability.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Carolyn McMahon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":492488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to strengthen working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-02-21T22:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Coura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":11111.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":21686.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036666,"comment":null},{"amount":5,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2409.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759226,"comment":null},{"amount":17.5,"local_amount":7777.78,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":8433.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790739,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":21686.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708441,"comment":null},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":5555.55,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-23T09:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6024.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708442,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":22222.22,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":24096.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189010,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":11111.11,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":12048.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484449,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":11111.12,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:35Z","rounded_local_amount":12048.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620691,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T22:41:32Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":178277,"name":"Leoncia Felipa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa se\u00f1ora Leoncia Felipa C.

She completes this activity alongside her husband. Both have farmed for 14 years and learned agricultural tricks on their own in order to produce a greater quantity of products. What she likes the most is the harvest of root vegetables, walking behind the plow that her husband drives, picking up the products with a blanket tied around her waist. At the same time, they raise two bulls, three sheep and two pigs.\r\n\r\nOn free days, her husband works as an operator in other fields earning money that is destined to cover the bills which allows them to live comfortably.

Senaida's favorite activity is selling the boxes she makes with her own hands and seeing how strong the boxes are, and how useful for people. \r\n \r\nSenaida believes her work is profitable because she has been able to use her earnings to buy fields in which she has planted coffee and which she will harvest next month. She is also able to cover the household expenses and her children's education. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Senaida would like to have a grocery store at home that her children could manage and thus earn their own incomes. \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan Senaida requests from Kiva partner MFP. She is happy to work at her communal bank because its members show unity and solidarity with each other. With the loan of PEN 1,000, she will buy coffee plants and 100 empty boxes to store plantains. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva

Many years ago she separated from her partner.  She has an adult son, who has formed his own family so she lives alone in her own house.\r\n\r\nDespite always living alone, she had goals to meet because her son was the motivating force in her life and because she loves the land of her birth: \"I grew up here eating corn, fried potato and toasted corn.  I don't feel like myself in some other place, this is why I won't go live with my only son; the noise of the city annoys me and here, you always have something to eat\" she says.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she farms corn, potatoes and peas on land she inherited from her parents.  She works alone and what she likes best is to plant alfalfa because, once it's cut, it resprouts up to four times and can last up to 3 years with good yields.  She also raises 150 guinea pigs that she sells at wholesale both for consumption (meat) and for reproduction (raising).  Because her activities are quite profitable and her 15-year-old grandson will soon come live with her, she plans to dedicate herself to alfafa growing and guinea pig raising because she wants to help him with his educational expenses.\r\n\r\nThis is her 7th loan with MFP and she states:  \"I don't trust any other institution because they offer benefits and then don't come through.  Besides, they don't care as much about you as this institution does; I'm happy here working in my communal bank.\"  \r\n\r\nShe will use the 2000 soles to buy three sacks of manure (potassium, nitrate and phosphate) to protect her potato crops and her alfalfa fields.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":493126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-22T06:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2565.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886767,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-22T11:37:49Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":178430,"name":"Florepe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florepe N. is from the city of Pagadian City.

To make a living, Rosa owns and operates a business venture making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for her business comes primarily from selling fish balls and other dimsums to the local community.

Rosa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Rosa is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be Rosa's second loan from ASKI.

She is thirty-eight years old. Marites is the group leader of a twelve-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarites is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Marites owns and operates a furniture-making business in the manufacturing sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from making and selling dining furniture to local businesses and community members. Marites has been engaged in her business for over fifteen years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marites joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. This loan will be Marites's first loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-five branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Las actividades agr\u00edcolas las comparte con su esposo, pues ambos solventan los gastos del hogar y como buenos campesinos limpian y cuidan adecuadamente sus tierras. La dificultad se presenta cuando los productos bajan su precio en el mercado, por lo que ya no ganan lo esperado, pero Rita refiere que siempre hay ganancias, sino ya no trabajar\u00edan, pues si un producto baja su precio, otro sube y se compensa el trabajo que desempe\u00f1an, es as\u00ed que piensa comprar m\u00e1s terrenos para sembrar en mayor cantidad.\n\nEste es el d\u00e9cimo pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP, donde viene ocupando uno de los cargos de la junta directiva de su banco comunal, donde aprendi\u00f3 a valorar el esfuerzo de cada integrante por salir adelante.

","en":"Rita, age 39, is married to 40 year old Luis.  They have three children, but they only live with eight year old Cristian in a rented house.  Their other children live in another city.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years she has been planting alfalfa, potatoes, corn, and peas.  At the same time she raises pigs, sheep, and cows.  She gets several liters of milk from the animals, and she makes cheese to sell at the city\u2019s weekly fair.  She shares the agricultural work with her husband, and they both pay the household expenses.  As good farmers, they clean and adequately take care of their land.  The difficulty occurs when the products\u2019 prices fall in the market.  Then they do not earn what they expected to earn.  But, Rita says that there is always income.  If there was not, they would not work.  If one product\u2019s price falls, another\u2019s rises.  This compensates them for the work they are doing.  That is why she is planning to buy more land to plant in greater quantity. \r\n\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP.  She is on the board of directors of her communal bank, where she learned to value the effort of each member to get ahead.  She will use the 3,000 PEN that she is requesting to buy another piece of land to cultivate.  She is now talking with the current owners, and she plans to plant alfalfa.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":493161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy a piece of land to cultivate","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-22T16:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3064.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886771,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-23T05:31:28Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":178456,"name":"Avil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Avil Z. is from the village of Catarman, Camiguin Province.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLeticia is married and has one grown child. To make a living, Leticia owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Leticia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Leticia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leticia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which she will use as additional working capital and to purchase additional inventory for her business. This will be Leticia's first loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-five branches covering the central and northeastern areas.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nelson B. is from the village of Annayatan, Baggao, Cagayan. He is forty-five years old. Nelson is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNelson is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Nelson owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Nelson has been engaged in his business for over six years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP whenever he sells an animal he raised.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nelson joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nelson has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. Nelson is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which he will use to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be Nelson's second loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay for his children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-five branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Although each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for repaying the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nDanilo is married and has 6 adult children. To make a living, Danilo owns and operates a general store where he sells food and daily-use products in the local community. Danilo is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Danilo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Danilo is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This will be Danilo's second loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Soeurn H. is 40 years old, married and lives in Kdei Tnaot village, Takeo province. He and his wife, Mrs. Mith Parch, are farmers who own a 1.50-hectare field on which they cultivate rice. They work hard, but are not able to earn enough money to support their family.

She is 25 years old. Nelybeth is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC.

The official name of this borrowing group is Nelybeth P. Group. Nelybeth is married and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, Nelybeth is engaged in farming cassava. Nelybeth has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Nelybeth joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Nelybeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed for her cassava plantation. Nelybeth is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used to finance her cassava plantation. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Nelybeth from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Bonfal West, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 51 years old. Remedios is the group leader of an 8-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRemedios is married and has 5 adult children. To make a living, Remedios owns & operates a tailoring business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing specialty tailoring services to local community members. Remedios has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Remedios joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Remedios has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional fabrics & materials. Remedios is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles & thread. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Remedios from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The group is called \u201cMujeres Maravilla\u201d (\u201cWonder Women\u201d) and is made up of 19 very active women from the same area who show great solidarity with one another.  They have different business activities, and some group members were able to start new businesses in order to generate income and thus support their families.  For example, Mrs. Ignacia V. did not have a business, but after joining this committee she became enthusiastic and started working as a street vendor selling clothing. She travels around, visiting commercial establishments in remote areas of the city. She earns good money and feels very fulfilled. She is happy to be able to help her family improve their quality of life.

She sells general merchandise to some of her friends and neighbors, who are her customers.  She started working 28 years ago because her husband did not help support the family.  Bernarda began selling tortillas and little by little, with the help of a few loans, she began earning income.  This helped her gain work experience, but her age does not allow her to continue making and selling tortillas because she suffers from rheumatism and tires easily, so she began selling general merchandise.  She is requesting this loan so that she can buy shoes, dresses, t-shirts, shorts, skirts, bags, and perfumes.

is 32 years old and married with two young children, ages 3 and 4, both of whom have started their schooling.

Her primary income comes from the sale of milk products to local residents, and she also earns money through her vegetable farming. She says that the main challenges to her business are the spread of diseases among livestock and that high employee turnover affects her productivity.\r\n\r\nBenedine requested this loan through the Kiva field partner, Juhudi Kilimo, for 30,000 KES to upgrade and expand her poultry farm. She says that the extra income from this loan will help improve her family's standard of living and she will be able to support her children in their education.

This group was formed thanks to Senora Gloria G., who had previously worked with a group, and who gathered her neighbors and friends from the San Antonio neighborhood in order to work with the Program Committee of Entrepreneurial Women.  Now they are in their fourth cycle with this program, and they are all very happy because thanks to working together and to the solidarity within the group, they have been able to get ahead and to keep adding to their working capital day by day.  The majority of the members started with loans granted by the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya.  The members of this group will use their loans for different activities such as: sale of food preparation ingredients, purchase of sewing supplies, purchase of stock for sale (sugar, rice, yerba, breads, milk products, meats, etc.), work in manicures and pedicures, sale of silver jewelry, sale of lingerie, sale of clothing, sale of beverages, sewing clothing, etc.  This is a very active group, all the members show commitment solidarity, attend the weekly meetings, and engage in activities that generate funds for the good of the whole group.  This is one of the best groups currently working with the Program, since the majority of the group members have engaged in the same business since the first loan, thus demonstrating their solidarity and communality.  One of the members is Senora Nancy, who with her family creates fine silver jewelry, she, her children and her husband all working together.  They also have a small shop where they display their work and they have very good sales that are enabling the family to get ahead.  Like Senora Nancy's family, all the members of the group have managed to get ahead graciously.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva
