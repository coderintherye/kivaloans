K. is 31 years old and married with one child.

This was after he had saved Ksh 15,000.00 (US$ 220) from his previous employment at a company by the name Kapa Oil Refineries. Boniface decided to invest his savings by buying 50 crates of eggs at a market known as Wangige which is located on the outskirts of Nairobi city. He later rented a stall at Mlolongo. <P>The egg selling business was going on well but people continued impressing on him to open a one-stop shop so that they could be making all their purchases at his shop which would save them time and effort by not having to move from one shop to another. <P>\r\n\r\nBoniface's business has been doing well recently due to the rapid growth of the population in this town. For this reason, he is requesting a loan of US$ 825. Given this loan, Boniface will add to the already existing stock at his shop which includes items like beans, rice, sugar, wheat flour, cooking fats and margarine. He believes that nothing will make his customers happier and keep them coming back than having a variety of items in one shop. The repayment period for his loan will be 12

N. is 46 years old, married with one child. He lives and operates a butchery at Embakasi Division along the North Airport Road, within Nairobi. James started his business in the year 2004. This was after he researched butcheries in Embakasi Division and found that there was only one butchery in the whole neighborhood. Being a business-minded person, James therefore decided to take a risk and open his own butchery. In order to do this, he sold his old pick-up truck for Ksh.250,000 (US$ 3,680).\r\n<P>\r\nUsing this money as his initial capital, James constructed a small stall on an undeveloped piece of land that he had purchased earlier. During this time, many residents in the neighborhood encouraged James to open the butchery quickly, since the only other butchery operator used to cheat his clients by selling less meat, since he purposely used faulty scales. Some of the customers also suspected that they were eating un-inspected meat, which during this time may have included donkey meat and some wild game, which is illegal in Kenya.<P>\r\n \r\nDue to James' honesty and friendly nature, many customers flock to his butchery, where he sells high quality meat. Apart from that, the area where his business is located is highly industrial, hence many company workers flock to his butchery to have some \"nyama choma\", \"mbuzi choma\" or \"kuku choma\", (these are traditional Kenyan delicacies of roasted beef, roasted goat meat and chicken respectively) together with ugali (a thick paste made from corn flour) and chips (potato fries), which James introduced some eight months ago upon the request of his customers.<P>\r\n\r\nDue to the increased number of customers, James intends to expand his business so as to satisfy his customers\u2019 demand for beef, chicken and fish. James is kindly requesting a loan of US$ 1,200). Given this loan, James will be able to purchase a deepfreeze for storage purposes, a chips warmer, and chairs and tables, which will help him to cope with the increasing demand for quality meat. He promises to provide his loyal customers with better services. The repayment period for his loan will be 10 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":67163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase a

N. N. is 39 years old. He is married and has one child. Martin started his business in the year 2003. This was after selling out his fruit-selling stall in Githurai town, in the outskirts of Nairobi. Martin made the decision to sell his fruit stall due to the huge losses he had because fruit is perishable. <P>Martin decided to venture into the furniture business because he had skills in this area after training in carpentry in the year 2002 at Christian Industrial Training Centre in Nairobi; hence he had confidence that he had all the skills needed. <P>In the year 2003 Martin purchased a second-hand plainer machine worth Ksh 28,000 (US$ 430). This machine was to help him with cutting and shaping the wood. He has been using the machine ever since, though it is prone to breaking down often, due to wear and tear, and this slows down his work.<P>\r\n\r\nRecently Martin got a contract to supply furniture to one of the major hotels in the city by the name of Kikwetu Hotel. This was due to the fact that Martin had earlier supplied the hotel with some beds, which were of high quality and had a one-year warranty. The contract he got recently is to supply the hotel with high quality chairs, beds, and tables. Though Martin is happy he got the contract, he is a very worried man because he may not be able to beat the deadline to supply said furniture, due to the persistent breakdown of his plainer machine. Martin is therefore requesting a loan of US$ 1,200.<P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan Martin will be able to purchase a new plainer machine and a portable tent, which will truly help him beat the deadline of the awarded contract. This will translate into more income and he will be able to employ two people full time who are currently working for him on casual basis, therefore creating employment for the two. The repayment period for this loan will be 10 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":67173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"To purchase a Plainer machine, a motor and a portable shed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ruai, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-09-20T04:15:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-04T14:55:24Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2007-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":120}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2007-11-16T10:20:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82258,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2007-12-16T10:21:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97890,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116394,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136242,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158965,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183728,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211303,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239460,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-07-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":268431,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-08-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-16T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":297612,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-09-20T14:55:24Z","paid_date":"2008-08-16T09:06:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":6,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":18690,"name":"Juan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juan is 40 years old and lives with his Brazilian wife and their 3 children who are 15 years, 13 years, and 11 months old.

He is married, and has one child of three years. He also lives with and takes care of his younger sister. He is originally from Kirinyaga district of Kenya, but now lives in the Ngong town area, and operates his business from the Kenyatta market area. \r\n\r\nPeter enrolled into Kigali Teachers College where he studied for one year. He then went through a very difficult period after his mother passed away after his first year in college. Unfortunately his father could not support him, since he now had another family. Due to this difficulty, he dropped out of college. He then went out and started off a small business selling groceries, but his working capital was small, and since he was still quite young, he was unable to manage the business properly and it collapsed. He then went to one of the slum areas called Kawangware, where he was employed to manage a beer pub. After about six months he was laid off. \r\n\r\nPeter then approached his uncle for help and fortunately his uncle took him in. His uncle then introduced him to selling second hand jeans at the Kenyatta market area. He started off here by working as a broker, whereby he would sell trousers on behalf of his uncle, and would then be given a small commission. With time, in the year 2001, he managed to put aside a little money from the commissions i.e. Ksh. 500 (USD 8), which he used as his initial capital to purchase four pairs of jeans trousers.  He sold them and was able to buy more jeans. One of his distant relatives suggested that he should consider selling stretch jeans since they would soon be coming into fashion, and he took the advice. For about seven years now he has specialized in the sale of stretch jeans, and he is glad he took the advice, since stretch jeans have become a favourite for many women who now form the bulk of his customers. \r\n\r\nPeter finds that the only reason he has not been able to expand his business is lack of capital, since he doesn\u2019t have collateral that would enable him to borrow from formal banks. He has so far managed to attract a regular flow of customers, and would like to increase his stock, so as to provide a better variety for them. Peter is therefore requesting a loan of USD75, with which he will buy additional jeans trousers in order to boost his stock. He intends to repay the loan over a period of 5 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":67214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase second hand jeans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kenyatta Market, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-09-20T13:55:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-04T14:19:24Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":75,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2007-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-11-04T10:20:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-04T10:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":76217,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-12-04T10:20:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-04T10:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":91218,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-01-04T10:17:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-04T10:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108107,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-02-04T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-04T10:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":127988,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-03-04T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-04T10:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":149016,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-09-20T14:19:24Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T10:04:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":18697,"name":"Albino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>I have a small business selling used clothes and tennis shoes.

Rachel started her business in the year 2002 and at this time, she operated her business from her house. She used to make tablecloths which she sold in the town of Meru, in the Eastern Province of Kenya. Rachel continued selling her tablecloths in Meru town until the year 2004 when she decided to introduce a new line into her business, by selling ladies suits after two ladies in Meru town commissioned her to make them suits. She made six additional suits to test the market and to her surprise, all the six were sold very quickly. From then on, Rachel decided to become a full time tailor specializing in ladies clothes.\r\n\r\nRachael has managed to employ several orphaned young women who help her with the tailoring work. Rachel now intends to expand her business by stocking tailoring materials and accessories so that her tailoring colleagues and customers do not have to travel all the way to the city center to buy these items. Rachel is therefore requesting a loan of USD750 that she intends to repay within 12 months. With this loan, Rachael will be able to boost her income by supplying tailoring materials and accessories such as lining, buttons, rings, canvas, thread biers and laces.

David M. is a case in point. In 2004, David took half a sack of beans and another half of maize to Kinanie market. He was able to sell his goods within two hours of his arrival at the market, which gave him the confidence and funds he needed to start his own business. David continued to take his cereals on a bicycle to Kinanie Market each day, until late 2004 when David secured a stall at the market. This was a milestone in David\u2019s life after many days of praying and fasting. David now devotes most of his time to running the stall and his business is doing very well. Recently too, Kinanie has started to expand and the population is growing at an alarming rate, which is an encouraging sign to the people in the business sector. \r\n\r\nDavid\u2019s stall is a beehive of activity as people scramble to buy his cereals, which are always fairly priced. David now needs to expand his business and is seeking a loan of USD825 to purchase a larger variety of cereals including maize, beans, rice, dried peas, green grams, black eyed peas, etc.  By expanding his range, he believes that he will have enough stock to meet the demands of all his customers, and will no longer have to turn away customers due to lack of stock.

learned the craft of weaving as a small girl.  With the help of her family she mounted a small workshop in her home where she makes sweaters, ponchos, and caps.  She and her husband sell the work on Sundays and Mondays at a small stand at the Laguna Temporal market in Juliaca and with the income provide for their two small children ages 8 and 12.  The children even lend a hand with the family business on top of attending school every day.  The family is proud to report that five other people are employed in the shop, this in a country facing problems of unemployment.  The hours are long and the work sometimes tedious but the workers are upbeat and grateful for the opportunity to provide for their families.  Matilde's dream is to raise the quality of her work such that she can export her garments and make the shop a prominent employer in her city.  She is asking for a loan of $650 and promises to repay the sum within 6 months.  Matilde and her family are counting on your generosity to help this dream become a reality.  <p> <b> Translated by a Kiva volunteer.  <\/b> <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMatilde, gracias  al oficio que aprendi\u00f3 desde muy ni\u00f1a y con ayuda de su familia; construy\u00f3 en el interior de su vivienda una peque\u00f1a f\u00e1brica de artesan\u00eda d\u00f3nde confecciona chompas, ponchos, chalinas y gorras; con el  ingreso que obtiene por la venta de estos productos, que los ofrece en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo los d\u00edas domingos y lunes en un peque\u00f1o puesto del mercado \u201cLaguna Temporal\u201dde Juliaca; mantiene su hogar y cubre las necesidades de sus dos peque\u00f1os ni\u00f1os de 8 y 12 a\u00f1os quienes tambi\u00e9n ayudan con el trabajo diario de sus padres adem\u00e1s de asistir diariamente a la escuela. \r\n\r\nA trav\u00e9s de esta actividad tambi\u00e9n les otorga trabajo a 5 personas  y de esta manera contribuye a disminuir la tasa de desempleo en nuestro pa\u00eds.

All this she does since she is now not strong enough to help Wayan Mawan her husband as a tenant farmer working the land. However Made P. still wants to help add extra income to pay for the 3 children that are still within their responsibilities, by raising pigs, that do not need a lot of extra efforts, it is enough to feed them twice a day morning, and evening, and to take care of the baby pigs to keep them healthy. From the 4 mother pigs Made P. own, every six months she could profit an average of Rp 4,200,000 (aboutUS$ 450), so that her contribution income by raising pigs are about Rp700,000 (about $75)\/month.

Kini Made P. telah memiliki 4 ekor induk babi yang  di beli dengan menggunakan  uang pinjaman yg di peroleh dari DINARI Rp   1.300.000 hal ini dilakukannya karena  sadar bahwa Made P. tak kuat lagi untuk bekerja  membantu Wayan Mawan suaminya sebagai petani  untuk menggarap tanah. namun begitu Made P. juga tetap ingin membantu memporoleh tambahan penghasilan untuk membiayai ketiga orang anak yang masih menjadi tanggungan keluarga ini dengan jalan memelihara babi yang tidak membutuhkan tenaga ekstra, dengan memberi makan 2 kali sehari  pagi dan sore dan merawat anak \u2013anak babi agar tetap sehat itu sudah cukup. namun hasil yang di dapat cukup lumayan . dari 4 ekor induk yang di miliki Made P. setiap enam bulan menghasilkan keuntungan  rata \u2013rata Rp 4.200.000 sehingga penghasilan tambahan yang di dapat oleh Made P. dari memelihara babi sebesar Rp 700.000\/bln. dengan hasil inilah Made P. bisa membantu meringankan beban suaminya bahkan sekarang dia sudah bisa

live peacefully and modestly is the hope of every family. Although living in a small hut with bamboo weaved walls, Ketut K. family seems to be peaceful and happy. Her husband work as a tenant farmer. He is very responsible towards his family. His hard work is not wasted by Kakek Budi, his children was able to finish high school. After marrying Ketut K. never stopped raising pigs though in very small numbers, only 1 or 2 each time, and even that done the traditional way by putting the pig on leash under a tree.\r\nMorning and evenings the pigs were fed with food obtained from the fields: leaves or talas roots that was cooked and sometimes mixed with rice shells during rice-harvest. After 3 months the pigs could be sold for Rp350,000 (about $38)\/each. With the loan to be obtained, Ketut K. will add another pig, and the rest to buy better foods like rice shells, concentrate or polar so that the pigs could grow faster. Also with the lengthy dry season reserve feed from the fields are getting difficult to obtain. With one additional pig and better feed, Ketut K. is convinced that she could get Rp300,000 (about $35)\/month nett, and this would add to daily family living expense, which average Rp20,000 (about $2.10) \/day.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nHidup rukun dan bersahaja merupakan idaman bagi setiap keluarga, walau dengan gubuk kecil yang berdindingkan gedek bambu keluarga Ketut K. kelihatan rukun dan sangat bahagia. Suaminya yang bekerja sebagai petani sangat bertanggung jawab terhadap keluarganya. kerja kerasnya ini juga tak di sia-siakan  oleh Kadek budi antara anak nya untuk menyelesaikan pendidikannya sampai tingkat SMA. Sejak menikah Ketut K. Tak pernah putus memelihara babi walau hanya dalam jumlah yang kecil yaitu 1 sampai 2 ekor saja, dan itupun dengan cara yg masih tradisional Babinya di ikat di bawah pohon, pagi dan sore ternaknya   diberi makanan yg di buat\/diperoleh dari sawah berupa daun daunan dan pohon ubi talas yg di masak. dan kadang-kadang di campur dedak kalau lagi musim panen padi. Setelah tiga bulan babinya laku di jual Rp 350.000\/ekor. Dengan pinjaman yang di dapat Ketut K. akan menambah lagi satu ekor ternaknya dan sisanya di pergunakan untuk membeli pakan yg lebih baik Seperti Dedak, Konsentrat dan juga Polar supaya ternaknya lebih cepat besar, di samping juga persediaan pakan di sawah mulai  susah didapat karena musim kemarau yg panjang. Dengan tambahan 1 ekor ternak dan pakan  yang juga berubah  sekarang Ketut K. yakin bisa mendapatkan hasil bersih panen ternaknya Rp 300.000\/ bulan, dan hasil ini cukup membantu menambah  biaya kebutuhan hidup keluarganya yang rata -rata Rp 20.000

Their income are barely enough to pay for daily food expenses, so that their children has to quit middle school, and help work as tenant farmers. From such background Mur (her nickname) like to have additional income to support her family expenses. As the case with many ladies in her village, Ms. Mur started this pig farming business. She choose this business since start up cost was not that high. With Rp500,000 (about ($60) Mur could buy 2 baby pigs that she could raise the traditional way by leashing these pigs under a tree, which was found as safe; and to raise these pigs won't take too much of her time, not more than 1 hour in the morning before she leaves for the paddy fields, and also in the evening back from work, and so on. Mur's efforts is growing, especially after obtaining a loan from DINARI for Rp1,300,000 (about $150) that she used to buy feedstock, and making a modest stall, so that her animals could be protected from the heat and rain. She has 4 pigs to raise now. Mur expect to profit Rp200,000 ($22)\/month.

Penghasilan yang di peroleh keluarga ini boleh dikatakan pas-pasan untuk biaya makan sehari - hari saja sehinga anak-anaknya pun harus putus sekolah pada tingkat SMP dan membantu bekerja sebagai buruh tani. Berangkat dari latar belakang inilah Mur begitu orang sering memanggilnya ingin mendapat hasil tambahan untuk menopang biaya keluarganya. Sama halnya seperti ibu-ibu lain di desanya sejak 2 tahun belakangan ini Mur mulai menekuni usaha ternak babi . Usaha ini dipilih karena biaya\/modal yang di perlukan tidak begitu banyak  dengan modal Rp  500 000 Mur sudah bisa membeli 2 ekor bibit yg kemudian di pelihara secara tradisional dgn mengikatnya di bawah pohon yg di anggap aman disamping itu memelihara babi tidak akan menyita banyak waktunya, tak lebih dari 1 jam di pagi hari sebelum berangkat ke sawah dan juga sorenya setelah pulang dari kerja begitu seterusnya.

Beside getting additional income, there are other benefits such as obtaining organic fertilizer from the manure or even for decompressing after spending a whole day tending the shop. The mother of Ni Putu Murniasih began her business since six years ago with one sow. She obtains a decent income because she raises the animals constantly. She is able to turn around the pigs quickly so in three months Luh Sekar could harvest two times with an average profit of 100,000 IDR (1 USD ~ 9,000 IDR).  Luh Sekar has a full support of her husband. His job as a farm labor was felt insufficient to cover the needs of four-person family so he also helps her to market the pigs and or to find the cheapest piglets. The loan is used to add two more sows and the remaining is used to do maintenance for the pen. She hopes to increase her profit by twice as much and use the profit to cover the basic needs and to pay for their children's education.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nBagi Luh Sekar yang keseharianya bekerja sebagai penunggu warung milik kakaknya Beternak babi adalah suatu pekerjaan sampingan yang sangat mengasikkan dan menjanjikan.  Di samping ada hasil tambahan, banyak manfaat lain yg di dapat seperti pupuk kandang bahkan kadang-kadang bisa menghilangkan pikiran yang jenuh setelah seharian menunggui warung. Dengan 1 ekor babi  Ibu dari Ni Putu Murniasih ini mulai usahanya sejak 6 th yang lalu walau hanya 1 ekor babi yang dimiliki hasil yg di peroleh cukup lumayan, karena pemeliharaanya dilakukan tanpa putus-putus. Begitu dapat untung di jual dan langsung beli lagi tanpa memperhitungkan waktu panen sehingga dalam waktu 3 bln Luh Sekar bisa panen sampai 2 kali dengan keuntungan rata-rata Rp 100.000  perbulan.Usaha Luh Sekar  juga mendapat dukungan dari Putu Yarta suaminya. pekerjaannya sebagai buruh tani dirasakan belum cukup untuk membiayai ke butuhan 4 orang dalam keluarga ini sehingga dia sering membantu memasarkan ataupun mencarikan bibit yg lebih murah. Setelah mendapat pinjaman Luh Sekar menambah babinya menjadi 2 ekor dan sisa uangnya  dipergunakan untuk menservice kandang. Keuntungan yang Luh Sekar dapatkan sekarang menjadi 2 kali lipat dari sebelumnya dan diharapkan bisa memenuhi biaya hidup setiaphari dan biaya sekolah anak-anak mereka."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":67474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

pig farming after dropping off from school. Even though she only finished elementary school, the wife of Made Ardika, a Java-bound truck driver, is very energetic and experienced on raising pigs, from feeding the stocks, cleaning the pen to caring the piglets. From two sows Juli can produce 40 piglets per year. One piglet is sold for 170,000 IDR (1USD ~ 9,000 IDR). She could earn a gross margin of 6,800,000 IDR per year. With one additional sow from DINARI loan, Juli could still manage to multi-task as a homemaker and as a member of her village community. Their house is owned by her in-law,  which motivates Juli to work even harder so she could save enough money to reach her dream to own her small house and to pay for her children's education.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMemelihara  babi  merupakan hobi dan sumber pendapatan tambahan dari ibu muda yg telah dikaruniai 2 orang anak ini.

So does Made Wantry, the wife of Kadek Suparma who works as a rock-carying truck driver. Living in Tukadaya village that is very remote from the city helps her current pig farming business. Starting with 250,000 IDR (1USD ~ 9,000 IDR) borrowed from her brother\/sister in-law, Made bought two piglets that she raised for three months and sold for 750,000 IDR. After subtracting the cost of animal feed for three months, Made earn a margin of 200,000 IDR. Albeit the small scale, Made is very excited to grow her business. With the loan from DINARI, she could pay off the money borrowed from her brother\/sister in-law and bought additional three piglets. She has a high hope that with additional capital she could gain even better return, so she could further help her husband to pay for their children (one in elementary school and another one is still a toddler) and to cover their basic needs.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\nDi samping melakukan aktifitas rutin sebagai ibu rumah tangga, Ibu-ibu di Bali pada umumnya memiliki suatu pekerjaan sampingan untuk menambah pendapatan keluarganya. Begitu juga yang dilakukan oleh  Made Wantri  istri dari Kadek Suparma yang bekerja sebagai sopir Truk pengangkut batu ini, Tinggal Di Desa Tukadaya yang sangat jauh dari kota sangat mendukung usaha ternak babi yang sekarang ini sedang di tekuninya. Mulai dari modal yang hanya Rp 250.000 itupun hasil pinjaman dari kakak iparnya Made membeli 2 ekor bibit babi yang  di peliharanya selama 3 bulan, yang kemudian laku dijual dengan harga Rp 750 000 .Setelah di hitung dan di potong biaya pakan yg dihabiskan selama 3 bulan   Made mendapat kelebihan Rp 200 000. meskipun sedikit hasil yang diperoleh, Made tetap semangat untuk mengembangkan usahanya ini. Dengan pinjam dari DINARI sekarang Ia telah mampu mengembalikan uang kakak iparnya dan membeli lagi bibit babi sebanyak 3 ekor besar harapan Made dengan tambahan modal   ini  akan memperoleh hasil yang lebih baik, sehingga dapat membantu suaminya dalam membiayai seorang anaknya yg duduk disekolah dasar dan satu lagi yg masih balita, disamping juga untuk biaya kebutuhan sehari-hari."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":67481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

M. is 30 years old. He is married, and has three children aged nine, six and three years. He also takes care of his brother in law who lives together with his family. They reside in Kayole, an informal settlement on the Eastern side of Nairobi. \r\n\r\nJeremiah started his hardware shop in March 2007. Before this, he was employed in a hardware store since 2004, after which he decided to open his own shop. Jeremy (as his friends call him) was not new to business, since he had tried his hand at running his own business immediately after he had completed his high school, back at home in Kisii, in Gucha District. There, he started a small shop at his home where he sold an assortment of fruits and vegetables. However, he felt that he could do more in order to get a higher income, and that is when he decided to come to Nairobi to build his business. While in Nairobi, he lived with his uncle, and he immediately started off another shop selling potato chips (fries) and bananas. Once this business picked, he left it for his wife to run, and it continues to run today. He often helps his wife in the shop in the evenings before closing for the day. \r\n\r\nJeremy now runs a hardware shop that he started off early this year, using some savings amounting to Ksh. 200,000 (USD 3075) that he had put aside from his chips business, together with some of the money he got from his previous employment in the hardware shop. As the business grows, Jeremy has found that he needs to have more stock in his shop, since there is an overwhelming demand from his customers who are mainly carpenters, drawn from the environs of Kayole. Since his operational capital is quite low, he finds that he is not able to buy goods in big bulk, hence he misses out on good discounts. At the same time, he is forced to travel often to the centre of Nairobi City in order to provide what his customers require. \r\n\r\nJeremy is therefore requesting a loan of USD 1175, with which he intends to buy additional stock for his business, including wood, ply wood, paints, veneer, block boards, velvet materials, cushions and nails. He believes that this loan will enable him to have a higher operating capital, and hence enable him to buy more things in bulk.  He will also spend less on transport, and of course will receive better discounts. He intends to repay the loan within a period of 8 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":67502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase hardware materials including: wood, ply wood, veneer, paints etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kayole, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-09-21T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeremiah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-05T16:24:24Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1175,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2007-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":146.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2007-11-16T10:20:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82260,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2007-12-16T10:21:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97892,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116396,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136244,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158967,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183730,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211305,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":146,"local_amount":146,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239462,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-09-21T16:24:24Z","paid_date":"2008-06-16T09:04:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":10,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":18789,"name":"Krouch","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Krouch P., 41, is married with 2 children, who are both students.

Normally she will buy cloth of different colors, which characterize the end mosquito net product she turns out.  Normally a net will weight approximately 1 pound\/unit, and will sell for anywhere from USD$3 to 4, depending on volume of nets bought by customer (usually sells to wholesale buyer). These numbers will give her about a 100% return on her sales, which is a usual margin for these products.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for a USD$375 loan which will allow her to buy about 3 times what she has been able to presently. This will allow her to do some USD$700 a month worth of her business' net income. As well, she plans to be able to fix a motorcycle which her husband would use in order to transport her to town, where she can sell her product. Otherwise the cost of going to the city is about another 3 times what it will cost them to furnish their own transportation facilities (usually some USD$5 \u2013two way, per person). Since the family wouldn\u2019t be able to feed themselves with the present level of income, when we visited her home for the Kiva reporting purposes interview, we noticed the husband was feeding the youngest child with a cow\u2019s milk.

Valentina and her family thank and hope for your generous support. \r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Yael Schwartzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nLa agricultura y ganader\u00eda son dos de las actividades que desempe\u00f1a Valentina y de las cuales posee amplio conocimiento. \r\nLa dedicaci\u00f3n, empe\u00f1o y esfuerzo que les hab\u00eda consagrado  durante mucho tiempo, pas\u00f3 a segundo plano cuando su esposo tuvo un terrible accidente que lo dej\u00f3 inhabilitado por 12 a\u00f1os. \r\nValentina hizo que recibiera innumerables tratamientos a fin de que recuperar\u00e1 su vitalidad y deseos de seguir luchando, junto a ella, por sus hijos.\r\nDebido a este infortunado hecho es que los avances que obtuvieron con el trabajo conjunto, se vieron disminuidos y ahora a pesar de los momentos muy tristes por los que tuvieron que atravesar, han decidido iniciar despu\u00e9s de 12 a\u00f1os el proyecto de repotenciar su negocio agr\u00edcola y ganadero para mejorar la calidad de vida de su familia.\r\nA ra\u00edz de este hecho es que ella hace una solicitud de 200 d\u00f3lares para impulsar su prop\u00f3sito con ayuda de su esposo e hijos y se compromete a retornarlos en un lapso de 6 meses.

For many years she has worked, providing and education and clothing to her children since they have been in the home. Despite her advanced age, together with her husband she continues to create cheese and milk from the cows that have provided economic stability since they were purchased many years ago. Now, through her daily labor she is able to provide food and sustenance to her young grandchildren. For this reason, Julia wishes to obtain an additional cow to increase her production so that she can continue to support the beloved descendants of her children.

She needed to clear the family's expenses so a relative gave her a small loan to set up a business selling sweets and cold drinks in the living room of her house, just to neighbors at first, but then expanding little by little.\r\n<p>\r\nMagda is asking for a US$325 loan to buy merchandise for her business and to continue growing it.  She's offering to repay the loan in 3 months.  She and her family thank you for supporting her growing business and for improving their quality of life.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nMagda es una mujer casada y su esposo trabaja como empleado en una tienda de venta de accesorios para autom\u00f3vil, ellos tienen tres peque\u00f1os hijos de 12 a\u00f1os, 6 a\u00f1os y 10 meses de edad, siendo su hija de 12 a\u00f1os la que le ayuda en su negocio.

contribution that each member provides to carry out this activity is important.\r\n\r\nSince establishing this business at home, demand has increased daily but with the moving of many families to the area, service has become inadequate.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Ruth is asking for a 400 dollar loan which she promises to repay in 6 months. With the loan, she plans to buy more pipes and a water pump to facilitate distribution and be able to supply more families in less time.\r\n\r\nLet's help Ruth's business be able to continue to contribute to the well-being of many families in Pucallpa.\r\n\r\n<b><p>Translated from Spanish by Alison Rives, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa visi\u00f3n de Ruth para los negocios y su esp\u00edritu emprendedor han hecho que lleve a cabo la construcci\u00f3n de un pozo en su domicilio para almacenar el agua y poder distribuirlo a sus clientes a trav\u00e9s de redes tubulares.\r\n\r\nComo todos sabemos este l\u00edquido elemento es de vital importancia para la sobrevivencia de los seres humanos y ante la falta continua de este servicio en los hogares de muchas personas dentro de su localidad, Ruth decidi\u00f3 iniciar este negocio.\r\n\r\n La contribuci\u00f3n que cada uno de los miembros brinda para desarrollar esta actividad es importante.\r\n\r\nDesde que estableci\u00f3 este negocio en su hogar la demanda se incrementaba diariamente pero es con el asentamiento de muchas familias en esta localidad que el servicio se ha vuelto deficiente.\r\n\r\n Por esta raz\u00f3n Ruth solicita un pr\u00e9stamo de 400 d\u00f3lares y se compromete a retornarlos en un per\u00edodo de 6 meses; para poder comprar m\u00e1s tubos y una bomba de agua a fin de  agilizar la distribuci\u00f3n y poder abastecer a muchas familias en menor tiempo.\r\n\r\nHagamos que el negocio de Ruth siga contribuyendo con el bienestar de muchas familias en Pucallpa."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":67726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water Distribution","sector":"Services","use":"To buy a water pump and pipes in order to offer better service to the community where Ruth and her family live","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-09-23T04:25:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-07T06:21:06Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-11-07T10:27:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-07T09:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":78034,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-12-07T10:29:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-07T09:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93258,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-01-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-07T09:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":111292,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-02-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-07T09:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130552,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-03-07T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-07T09:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152253,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":65,"local_amount":65,"processed_date":"2008-04-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-07T09:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":176340,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-09-23T06:21:06Z","paid_date":"2008-04-07T09:10:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":18881,"name":"Lucy Sesega","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is a mother of two children and she is proud of her business of elei printing (a traditional Samoan way of printing fabrics).

a housewife Sriyati is not that busy taking care of her daughter, since she is already 14 years old and is in 9th grade. However daily expenses have increased. Sriyati's husband work in a machine shop and earns Rp8000,000 (about US$72)\/month. Of course that kind of income was not enough to cover daily household expenses. The Laundry business mother Sriyati is working on was to supplement the family's income. The suggestions she has covers: washing machine and iron. Her capital plus capital she obtains from DINARI every 3 months was also to buy locally made detergent Rinso and its perfume as supplement. Every week she could earns about Rp150,000 (about $16.50). However their living expenses were Rp20,000 (about $2.20)\/day. When added schooling expenses  it cost her Rp150,000 (about $16)\/mo. Therefore Sriyati's business helps her husband in the family income.  Sriyati is doing this business in her rented room with cement floor, asbestos roof, and batako wall. Sriyati and her husband hope that their children could go to higher education.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSebagai ibu rumah tangga, Sriyati tidak begitu repot dalam mengurus putrinya karena putrinya sudah berusia 14 tahun dan duduk di kelas 3 SMP.  Namun biaya yang dikeluarkan semakin besar. Suami Sriyati bekerja di bengkel dengan penghasilan Rp 800.000,00\/bulan. Penghasilan tersebut tentunya masih belum mencukupi untuk memenuhi kebutuhan dalam rumah tangga mereka. Usaha Laundry ini ditekuni oleh Ibu Sriyati demi menambah penghasilan keluarga. Sarana yang dia gunakan antara lain : mesin cuci dan setrika. Modalnya sendiri ditambah dengan modal yang dia dapatkan dari DINARI setiap tiga bulan dia menyediakan rinso dan parfum sebagai stok.  Setiap minggunya keuntungan yang bisa dia peroleh sekitar Rp 150.000,00. Sedangkan biaya hidup perhari mereka adalah Rp 20.000,00.

Her main customers are tourists, the faithful who flock to the Virgen de Caacupe--the image of the Virgin at the Basilica de Caacupe that is one of the main attractions of that city--every year, along with passing motorists.  Silvina works with her mother and son and the three of them pull together to meet their monthly sales goals.  Silvina's mother is in charge of making the headwear; her son sells their products at local festivals in Cordillera--the department in south-central Paraguay where Caacupe is located; and Silvina sells from the shop in her house.\r\n<p>\r\nHer main achievement--that is, to say, what has allowed her to buy her own home--has been to broaden the range of merchandise she sells which, in turn, has allowed her to increase sales.  She said that starting the business was very difficult because she had to meet government regulations for starting a business at the same time that she was being mother and father to her son.  Nevertheless, she has managed through perseverance to get ahead and now she's even planning to expand her business, renovating a small shop near the Basilica de Caacupe, for which she's looking to the Fundacion Paraguay to help her raise enough money to finish.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Silvina 51 a\u00f1os, es madre soltera y tiene 1 hijo, su taller de confecci\u00f3n est\u00e1 ubicado en su mismo domicilio d\u00f3nde tambi\u00e9n tiene su sal\u00f3n de exposici\u00f3n y venta de sus art\u00edculos, sus principales clientes son los turistas, los fieles que visitan a la Virgen de Caacup\u00e9 cada a\u00f1o (la imagen de la virgen se encuentra en la Bas\u00edlica de Caacup\u00e9 y es una de las principales atracciones de la ciudad)  y los automovilistas que pasan frente a su negocio.\r\nActualmente Silvina, trabaja con su mam\u00e1 y su hijo, los tres se ayudan mutuamente para lograr sus objetivos de ventas mensuales, la encargada de confeccionar los kepis y sombreros es la madre de Silvina, su hijo sale a vender sus productos en las fiestas patronales de las principales ciudades del departamento de la Cordillera, mientras que Silvina los vende en su local.\r\n<p>\r\nSu principal logro dice ser el hecho de haberse comprado una casa propia, y  aumentado el volumen de sus mercader\u00edas en el negocio, lo cual le permiti\u00f3 aumentar sus ventas.

Together, with your generous support, let\u2019s help Isaela and her husband achieve their goal. <p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b>Isaela y su esposo cuentan con un fundo en el que realizan sus actividades ganaderas con mucha comodidad; a pesar de contar con 58 y 59 a\u00f1os respectivamente a\u00fan se sienten con muchos deseos de trabajar y mejorar su calidad de vida.En las amplias instalaciones de este lugar cuentan con un terreno amplio en el que desean sembrar camu- camu para abastecer de este producto a muchos laboratorios que fabrican medicinas alternativas a base de este fruto, la iniciativa de Isaela naci\u00f3 a ra\u00edz de las averiguaciones que hizo sobre sus bondades curativas ya que de un tiempo a esta parte para combatir las dolencias de muchas personas este tipo de preparados naturales se ha convertido en un boom dentro de nuestro planeta.Y para iniciar este proyecto Isaela, solicita un pr\u00e9stamo de 800 d\u00f3lares con el  compromiso  de retornarlos en un per\u00edodo de 6 meses. Hagamos juntos que Isaela y su esposo logren su prop\u00f3sito con ayuda de tu generoso aporte."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":68010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","use":"To plant <i>camu-camu<\/i>, a medicinal plant, for sale to alternative medicine laboratories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-09-26T12:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-10T15:51:30Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-11-10T10:21:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79524,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-12-10T10:23:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94801,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2008-01-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":113331,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2008-02-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":132819,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154856,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":130,"local_amount":130,"processed_date":"2008-04-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":130,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":179102,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-09-26T15:51:30Z","paid_date":"2008-04-10T09:14:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":19000,"name":"Taisisi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Taisisi has been in the trading business for quite a long time.

Her friend told her about the good benefits and incentives the company offered and she decided to get involved in the business. She began with a close circle of friends, which opened the door to many more customers. Her friendly manner made her into one of the most popular cosmetics salespeople and it was thanks to this work that she was able to improve her family\u2019s situation. <p>Miriam would like to increase her capital so that she can acquire a larger quantity of products, in order to be able to offer them to her clients in the moment when they need them, without any difficulties.

Located in the traditional fishing village of Yoff, <i>Sant ak Koolut\u00e9<\/i> has long specialized in producing the batiks and other vibrant hand-dyed fabrics that are used to make traditional clothing here in Senegal.  In addition to their main occupation of cloth-dyeing, the members of <i>Sant ak Koolut\u00e9 group<\/i> collaborate in a wide variety of modest income-generating activities, from raising chickens and vegetable gardening to sewing and crafting artisanal dolls.  The funding from this loan will be used to expand the <i>Sant ak Koolut\u00e9<\/i> cloth-dyeing business, including the purchase of a greater variety of blank fabrics and dye colors. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the <i>Sant ak Koolut\u00e9 group<\/i> group's second Kiva loan.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as <i>tontines<\/i>. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the <i>tontines<\/i> provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional <i>tontines<\/i> from meeting the demand for rural micro-enterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.
