Her family does not own their apartment yet, but they have a mortgage loan from another bank in order to eventually own it.  She has been on schedule with her mortgage loan payments to date. It is her family\u2019s goal to one day own their apartment. \r\n\r\nMrs. Narantuya\u2019s husband works as an engineer at Naran Tuul Trade and her oldest daughter is a teller at a Mongolian bank. Mrs. Narantuya supports her family by operating a beauty salon. Her youngest daughter helps her mother at the salon by giving manicures and pedicures to customers. Other services that Mrs. Narantuya\u2019s family salon offers are body and head massages, facial treatments, and eyebrow tattoos. \r\n\r\nWhen she began her business in 2001, Mrs. Narantuya\u2019s salon was in a small space with only one massage bed. Since that time, her salon has expanded to three massage beds with a variety of other services in a larger space than before. Recently, the salon has had an average of twenty customers per day. \r\n\r\nWith this loan of 1,200,000 MNT, Mrs. Narantuya will purchase beautician equipment which can remove freckles and tattoos and clean facial skin. The loan will hopefully allow her to expand her service offerings and give higher quality services with better equipment than she currently owns. The salon\u2019s extra earnings will go towards her family\u2019s expenses and reaching her family\u2019s goal of being secure in their own apartment.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":679603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase beautician equipment which can remove freckles and tattoos and clean facial skin","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":180,"posted_date":"2010-12-28T22:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narantuya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":1200000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":410000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191494626,"comment":null},{"amount":333.34,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:05:51Z","rounded_local_amount":410000.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195922672,"comment":null},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":410000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201365058,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-29T07:01:50Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:18:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":261592,"name":"M\u00e8la P\u00e8la","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mlle P\u00e8la a un enfant en charge et est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 31 ans.

The other part will be invested in her business. \u00a0She is counting on having more capital in order to satisfy her customers further. \u00a0\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":679942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"Buying fruit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-12-28T15:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Youma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adjara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assetou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":675000,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":135000},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":135000},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":135000},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":135000},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":135000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":135000,"processed_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":136181.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606445,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":135000,"processed_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":136181.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195918094,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":135000,"processed_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":136181.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201361023,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":135000,"processed_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":136181.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226324,"comment":null},{"amount":275,"local_amount":135000,"processed_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:29Z","rounded_local_amount":136181.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301183,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-12-28T18:14:44Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":261612,"name":"Richard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Richard is 36 years old, married and blessed with four children, who are all in school.

The laws had recently changed, requiring fourplexes to have sprinkler systems installed.  \u201cThere were only five companies that did that between San Antonio, Laredo, and La Isla.  Only one company wanted to come look at my project.\u201d Due to the high demand of this sprinkler installation service and the low supply, companies could get away with overcharging. David decided that he would get certified to install sprinkler systems and charge this service for a more reasonable price. \r\n\r\nDavid says he charges about a third of what that company charged him for a comparable job. David and his 10 employees now install sprinkler systems and fire protection in private, commercial, and government buildings.\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenges in this industry are finding credit and funding everything up-front.  \u201cRight now my dream is just to survive.  \u2026It\u2019s very difficult to get credit, so you have to fund everything yourself.\u201d  David\u2019s clients do not pay him until the job is done, or up to 90 days later.  In the past, the people who sold the raw materials would take some of this risk by offering credit. \u201cBut now they don\u2019t have inventory\u2026 now you go to them and say \u201cI need this and this\u201d and they say \u2018good.  Pay me now, and I\u2019ll go get it for you.\u2019 So you become the financier for your clients.  Because you have to go buy the materials and then wait to be paid at the end of the job. You have to start with your money.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat is not the only reason the industry is so difficult, David says.  \u201cNone of the other companies want to help you.  \u2026They never tell you where to start if you want to get certified\u2026 and if anyone starts charging a cheaper rate, they start badmouthing them.  That way no one will contract them and the price never lowers.\u201d\r\n\r\nDavid is proud of his work.  \u201cWe\u2019ve done about 200 installations. About 99% of our clients are very happy and use us again or recommend us to others.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis loan will go to buy tubing and other raw materials in order to install sprinkler systems in a 12-story building in La Isla.  David needs to buy the materials up front, \u201cSo I\u2019m looking for credit anywhere I can.\u201d\r\n\u2003\r\nWithout this loan, David would have to hire fewer workers and take on smaller jobs.  David originally went to a bank, but they said they do not lend for this kind of loan. \u201cA loan to buy a house, yes.  But to buy raw materials?  Not one cent.\u201d \r\n\r\nDavid hopes that eventually he can get a larger loan or a revolving line of credit.  \r\n\r\nDavid supports his wife and two children with this company. He is from Mexico, but moved to the U.S. 20 years ago.  David describes himself as \u201ca person who wants to help the community but every day it\u2019s more difficult.\u201d  He advises other business owners \u201cdon\u2019t spend effort on superfluous things.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2815.06,"image":{"id":675469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Utilities","sector":"Services","use":"To

After serving in the army, Omurjan worked as a tractor driver at the state farm.   \r\n\r\nIn 1995, Omurjan decided to start his own cattle breeding business in order to earn a living to support his family.  Omurjan bought one bull-calf with the money that he had put aside for a rainy day.  Due to his persistent and hardworking personality, Omurjan managed to multiply his investments and bought a used car.  Today, his farm has two milk cows and he sells their milk at the local market.  He also has three horses and forty sheep. \r\n\r\nOmurjan is applying for a loan of 120,000 KGS to buy two milk cows and three bull-calves.

She lives in her own house, together with her husband and their two children.  Her first business was a book store, but time proved that it was not profitable so she decided to change direction.  Now she sells basic perishable goods like ground spices, vegetables, and fruits, and her business is doing very well.  She feels very happy with her store because not only does she sell her products, but she also gets to interact with her neighbors.  Her patience and good customer service have won her customers' preference and made her business the busiest around.  Therefore, she feels very motivated to keep working.\r\n\r\nFor now, she only tends to her customers through her window, as her house was not designed for this purpose.

Esther works selling costume jewelry such as earrings, bracelets, necklaces, barrettes, hand-made headbands and imitation jewelry. \r\n\r\nEsther buys merchandise from the Lima\u2019s central market and then sends it to the province Pucallpa (Peruvian jungle) where distributors receive the goods. This is how Esther has done business for over two years, looking for new designs and finding new suppliers that allow her to keep prices more affordable than department stores. For the most part, Esther\u2019s business is very profitable, which is why Esther is pleased. In addition, she has more time to devote to her children. \r\n\r\nGoing forward, Esther plans to finish construction on her home with quality materials.

Desde que tenia 20 a\u00f1os de edad, se dedico a la agricultura, sus principales cultivos constan de papa y alverjas; lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su labor es poder cuidar de su becerra mientras limpia la maleza que crece entre sus sembr\u00edos, pero lo que no le gusta a Elizabeth, son las temporadas donde los agricultores cosechan gran cantidad de hortalizas, ya que saturan el mercado y no le permite tener buenas ganancias. Pero es en est\u00e1 temporada que ella, deja secar la alverja, la cual se convierte en semilla, vendiendo el saco de semilla de alverja a un mayor precio; en el mercado central de Tarma, lo que le permite estabilizar su econom\u00eda.

She is a hard-working woman who lives with her mom, 52 year-old Abelarda, and her dad, 54 year-old Abraham.  She loves and looks after her parents in their own home which is located in the village of Cumutay.\r\n\r\nSince she was 20 years old, Elizabeth has been working as a farmer.  Her main crops are potatoes and peas.  What she most likes about her work is being able to look after her calf while she clears away the weeds that grow between her crops.  What Elizabeth does not like are the seasons when farmers grow a large quantity of vegetables because they flood the market and she can't make good profits.  In this season she is leaving her pea crop to dry.  She will convert it into seed and will sell sacks of pea seed at a higher price in the central market in Tarma which will allow her to stabilize her finances.\r\n\r\nWith all the good decisions that she has made, Elizabeth is thinking of opening a restaurant in her area because there isn't one at present.\r\n\r\nThis is Elizabeth's eighth loan with MFP and, as a young woman, she assures us that her community bank plays a predominant role in her life since it helps her to grow and set herself new goals.  Elizabeth will use this loan to buy 15 sacks of organic fertilizer which cost around 100 Peruvian soles a sack.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":680973,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy 15 sacks of organic fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1052.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549699,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-01T13:39:53Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":261977,"name":"Fanni Jovita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201c\u00d1AUPASUNCHIS\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

He hopes to be a return lender with Kiva, who he thanks for this support which he truly needs; he is a responsible, humble, and creative person.\r\n\r\nHis biggest wish is that his son grows more within the business and becomes a great person, and that they do not lack anything.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":681008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase goods for his neighborhood store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Nueva Guinea, RAAS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Gilberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":157.53,"local_amount":3406.06,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3445.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766845,"comment":null},{"amount":77.27,"local_amount":1670.7,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1690.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209887,"comment":null},{"amount":77.3,"local_amount":1671.37,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1690.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078688,"comment":null},{"amount":77.39,"local_amount":1673.38,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211147741,"comment":null},{"amount":76.37,"local_amount":1651.18,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1670.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216433273,"comment":null},{"amount":77.96,"local_amount":1685.56,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1705.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221598248,"comment":null},{"amount":78.8,"local_amount":1703.85,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1723.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226967956,"comment":null},{"amount":76.79,"local_amount":1660.41,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1679.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232726633,"comment":null},{"amount":225.59,"local_amount":4877.49,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4934.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257103330,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-07T16:08:23Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:15:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":261991,"name":"Elisa Audelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n\n\nELISA AUDELINA O.

J. created Visions CPR, First Aid & EMT Training because she wanted to provide excellent training for medical professionals. Audrey has been working in the medical sector for over 30 years. She was originally a medic in the Army and then began training others in 1986. Her passion for teaching led her to open her own training center to ensure students receive top quality courses.  \r\n\r\nThe Visions CPR courses give medical professionals the skills to save lives. Audrey\u2019s loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana was used to replace old equipment, to pay three months\u2019 rent on the facility, and to put money aside to pay instructors. There are many companies that offer training in the industry, so Audrey has to make Visions CPR stand out. She does this by buying state of the art equipment and by hiring professional paramedics to teach classes. The professional paramedics give her clients \u201coff the books\u201d knowledge that they may not receive at other training centers.\r\n\r\nAudrey opened her business in 2006 and has been working to improve it since then. Her advice to people opening new businesses is to find the best ways to advertise because advertising can be difficult. She also wants to tell new entrepreneurs that starting a business is not easy. She says, \u201cYou have to have a desire to do what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Audrey has proven that being patient and diligent, despite setbacks, will help a business succeed. She looks forward to continuing to provide medical professionals with the courses they need.  \r\n\r\nFeel free to check out her website:
