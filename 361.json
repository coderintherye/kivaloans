a poor woman like Genoveva B. growing a business is quite hard, especially when what she makes in a day is barely enough to provide for her  family's needs. Moreover, Genoveva is the sole provider for her two dependent children.  Her eldest daughter is 26 years old and unemployed because of low educational attainment, and Genoveva's youngest is still in school and soon will be in high school which means she will be incurring more expenses for her education.\r\n\r\nThough Genoveva was able to successfully repay the loan she took out last year, she chose not to increase the amount of loan she is requesting now. She plans to use this loan to buy rice for resale.  The basis for the small amount she has requested is her capacity to pay. Hopefully someday, her eldest daughter will be able to help Genoveva in her business, or will find a job and be able to help with the family's expenses. \r\n\r\nDespite the poverty her family suffers presently, Genoveva still hopes that someday their standard of living be

She uses public transportation to get back to her business place. She resides and works in a semi-urban and slum area, which is on the outskirts of Kampala. Alice works seven days a week and also rents her business premises. She gets an average of twenty customers per day and sells to all categories of people on a retail basis. She has been running this business for the last six years, and she has been with MCDT and the same group mates for six years. This is her thirteenth loan. Alice's major challenge is the rainy season, as her customers are inconvenienced and, at times, halt going to her for a drink. This is so, because her place of business is covered with mud and water during the rains. Thieves also break into her business and go away with her brew. \r\n<p>\r\nAlice is boastful of her improved standard of living and her business's progress. She is aspiring to buy some land for herself in order to construct a commercial house and earn some money from

Bineba is the mother of four children. She lives in Ntamulung, Cameroon.  \r\n\r\nShe has been with GHAPE since 2004 and has demonstrated a credit-worthy character exemplified by her repayments, consistent attendance at meetings, and support of her borrowing group. \r\n\r\nR. never had the opportunity to go to school because her parents could not afford her fees and needs, so she resorted to becoming a farmer in her youth. Sadly, her father finally died in 1990 and monkeys ate all her crops last year. She was financially down, but with the management skills she acquired from GHAPE, she was able to repay her loan. \r\n\r\nWith this latest loan, R. is hoping to continue the business supported by her prior loans and add a motorbike business. She has requested a loan to purchase a motorbike and a few seedlings. The seedlings will eventually be farmed during the rainy season. R. is confident that her business will succeed, because her business has been successful for a long time.\r\n  \r\nShe hopes to use the profits from her business to provide for the various needs of her family. As the sole provider for her family of four, R. hopes to increase her profits so she has enough to pay for her children\u2019s school fees and provide for her family\u2019s nourishment.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\n\r\nR.'s loan will be provided by Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE), a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":497062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To purchase a motorcycle and seedlings for farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntamulung, Bamenda, NW.

She is the mother of five children. She is currently requesting her third loan from GHAPE. She has been with GHAPE since 2007 and has demonstrated a credit-worthy character exemplified by her repayments, consistent attendance of meetings and support of her borrowing group. \r\n\r\nVivian raises chickens and transports passengers on her motorcycle. With this latest loan, Vivian is hoping to continue the business supported by her prior loans. The fowl eventually will be sold on Foncha street and the motorbike will be roaming the Bamenda town carrying passengers. She is confident that her business will succeed because it is located in a strategic position within the market. She also feels that her friendly approach towards her customers also makes a big difference. \r\n\r\nVivian hopes to use the profits from her business to provide for the various needs of her family. She hopes to increase her profits so she has enough to pay for her children\u2019s school fees, open an account, and provide for her family\u2019s nourishment. \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\n\r\nHer loan will be provided through the Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE), a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":497069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"To buy a motorcycle, chickens, and chicken feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Foncha St, Nkwen, NW.

Vilma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Vilma is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Vilma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

is married with six children. He and his entire family live in a house with seven rooms in Ndamukong. This very hard working man joined GHAPE in 2008. H. has encountered some problems in life, such as the death of his father, mother, brother and child in 1992. He was also regrettably unable to continue school, which he loved so much. He became frustrated after he dropped out of school. Thanks to GHAPE, which was created at the time when he most needed it, H. resorted to thinking about going into business. He joined GHAPE and collected his first loan of 37,500 XAF to begin farming and selling firewood. \r\n\r\n<p>As a young talented man, even though things are not moving well with his family since his wife has undergone surgery, he is determined to make it in life. With the skills and trainings received from GHAPE, he has been able to improve his living standards. He farms and runs his firewood business for a living. He plans to invest this loan in buying firewood and seedlings along with feed for his piglets, bought with previous loans.\r\n\r\nH. has been quite successful in the past with his business and is now earning good profit from it due to the fact that he has lots of experience. Part of his profits from this loan will be used to take care of his children, buy necessities for the family and get good medication for them whenever they are sick.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

B. is a 37-year-old man whose family lives in Arhangay, one of Mongolia's central provinces. Since 2000, he has been running a raw materials sales business. He buys animal skins, cashmere and wool from local herders and sells them at the local market or transports them to Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia to sell for a better price. Besides this business, together with his spouse Saihantuya, he runs a retail stall at the local market.

She is 36 years old, divorced and mother to two children, whose ages range from 13 months to two and a half years old. She has had a business buying and selling \"thioubs\" (a special tinted fabric) for more than seven years. At the same time she is employed to do the cleaning by a cleaning agency. It was the influence of her sister, who lives in Tamba, that led her to choose the \"thioub\" selling business. What interests her most about this business is that it is lucrative. She is applying for a loan of 300,000 francs in order to buy \"thioubs\" and increase her business volume. The growth in her profits will allow her to cover her personal needs more easily as well as those of her family. Her aim is to improve her family's living conditions.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n \n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":497214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase rice, beans, wheat flour and maize flour as aditional ingredients for her cafe.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Morogoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.816667 37.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatuma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":181007,"name":"Sunday","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sunday Y. is currently in the business of selling greens at the market and is requesting a loan to purchase more greens, vegetables and fruits, to sell.

The main economic activities there are livestock and agriculture, particularly the cultivation of pineapples, being that these are sold principally in international markets.  For this reason the community has seen economic development in recent years, generating an increased demand for goods and services that is providing better work opportunities for the population.\r\n\r\nA short time ago Ana Cecilia started a business making women's purses.  She says that she started with a borrowed machine, and little by little she has seen the business give results and now it is going very well.  She makes different types of purses that she later sells in the businesses in the community; people also come to her house to buy them.  Her small business has helped considerably to improve her family's living standards.\r\n\r\nNow Ana Cecilia wants to take a loan of 400,000 Costa Rican colones, to buy a sewing machine and materials such as fabric, thread, etc.  With this investment she expects to be able to increase her production and improve the quality of her products.  She says that thanks to this loan she will be able to offer more and better options for her current and potential customers.\r\n\r\nAna Cecilia is a member of the communal bank \"Mujeres al \u00c9xito de la Trinchera de Pital\" (Successful Women of Trinchera de Pital), one of 100 of such organizations that are part of EDESA in Costa Rica.

She is a young entrepreneur who is very charismatic, and she tells us that the example of her parents led her to become a better human being.  For 13 years she has worked in a handicraft company located in the heart of the Sacred Valley of the Incas.  This company is an exporter and makes beautiful works in clay.  It is a well-established company and its finished products are of the highest quality.  Teresa feels content to continue working for this company that has given her the opportunity to grow and learn a lot.

G. is 52 years old and lives with his mother in the small community of La Trinchera de Pital, which is located in Alajuela Province.  The main business activities in the area are livestock breeding and agriculture, with an emphasis on the cultivation of pineapple to be sold primarily to international markets.  Community development has been growing in recent years, thereby generating more demand for goods and services, as well as creating job opportunities.\r\n<p>\r\nFrom a young age, Don Jorge has been raising pigs for fattening.  He sells the animals to residents of the community, who are very satisfied with their quality.  Since his business started, Don Jorge says it has done very well and has enabled his family to get ahead.  He is now requesting a loan of 500,000 CRC to acquire more pigs for fattening.  Part of the money will be used to purchase feed and other supplies needed for his business to succeed.  With this investment, he hopes his micro-enterprise will continue to grow so that he can serve more customers and offer them better products.\r\n<p>\r\nJorge Alberto R. G. is a member of the Communal Enterprise of Successful Women for La Trinchera de Pital, one of 100 partner organizations that make up EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his first loan and he hopes to continue growing personally and financially.  In addition, he plans to actively participate in his local micro-credit organization.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She says that she feels very capable and very happy to be able to stay active.  \r\n\r\nAt this time Adriana wants to obtain a microloan of \u00a2656,000 (six hundred and fifty six thousand Colones) to plant and to maintain the harvest. In addition, she wants to buy chemical and organic fertilizer and other materials.  With this investment, she hopes to have a good harvest, with a product with appropiate characteristics to fetch a high price to be able to increase production. \r\n \r\nAdriana is a member of the Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores Agr\u00edcolas Ramonenses, one of 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be her first loan and with it she hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level as well as continue to participate actively in the credit organization in her community.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":795.84,"image":{"id":497316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of materials for planting and maintaning plantains.

At present, although she is not supporting anyone, she keeps planting. Her children suggested she should rest after so many years of work, but Maximiliana really likes to work the land.  She says that she is used to waking up every day at dawn to care for her green fields. She has a lot of plans for the future. Among them is her wish to plant in greater quantities, especially peas, since she knows the price for that product is maintained in the market.  \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan that she has had with MFP and she is very grateful to all the people who make it possible to be able to access credit that will allow her to continue working to get ahead.  The money she is asking for she will invest in the purchase of fertilizers and pea seed, since she wants to continue planting and she must secure her lands for future plantings.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":497345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of fertilizers and seed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-26T19:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2073.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886824,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-26T20:37:47Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":181093,"name":"Leovilgildo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leovilgildo G. is engaged in the rice farming business.

Once he got his own molds and work tools he hasn't stopped working in this firm, which produces enough income to meet all his expenses; in addition, it daily provides him with the satisfaction of knowing that homes are built with his bricks.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason behind his asking for funding, in the amount of $800.000, to buy raw materials, particularly cement and sand, to make the bricks he sells.  \r\n\r\nHis dream is to organize his business in a site where he can both set up his production process and keep a larger stock of product.  His constant challenge is not having sufficient capital for this purpose but he knows that, with discipline, he will gradually build it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan,

L. is 32 and married with 6 children (ages 1 - 12).  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Nofo has 4 years of experience in this business.  Nofo needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Nofo joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Nofo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nofo L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

SPBD's loans are Malia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Malia E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling local Samoan snacks such as palusami (coconut cream wrapped in taro leaves), cooked taro, yams, and soupo ese (hearty papaya soup).  Sina has 2 years of experience in this business.  Sina needs a loan of WST $750 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sina joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sina I. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 52 and married with 3 children (ages 6 - 15).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Sapini has 4 years of experience in this business.  Sapini needs a loan of WST $1800 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nSapini joined SPBD.This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sapini's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sapini T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 30 and married with 1 child (1-month-old).  She owns a business venture, driving a taxi.  Maimoaga has 4 years of experience in this business.  Maimoaga needs a loan of WST $1200 to maintain the vehicle.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maimoaga joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Maimoaga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Maimoaga T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Mart\u00ednez lives in the the Crespo neighborhood in Cartagena de Indias where she has a business called \"Julia Hair Salon; it's location in the north of the city, in a tourist area, very close to the ocean, makes her business a special place, frequented by a large number of customers. Julia started 15 years ago, when she learned her trade in a French beauty school and opened in a very small location, gradually improving her infrastructure and finally employing two hairdressers. They offer beauty treatments for men's and women's hair, including cuts, coloring, straightening and styling. \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan Julia has requested through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she is applying for $2.300.000, which she will invest in improvements to her new location and the purchase of supplies for her salon like shampoo, dyes and hair treatments. The financing she has received previously has been effective because she has been able to change the furniture in her salon and make her clients more comfortable, as well as increasing her family's income. Her family depends on her salon and her husband's work which is a food micro-enterprise that was created with the savings from the hair salon and also adds to their family's income. \r\n\r\nJulia dreams of giving jobs to more people who need them by opening another branch of her salon. Her greatest challenge happens in the beginning of the year, when she has fewer customers, but she overcomes it through promotions and special discounts for her regular customers. \r\n\r\n <br

P. is 45 and married with 6 children (ages 5 - 15).  She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Merelini has 3 years of experience in this business.  Merelini needs a loan of WST $1700 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nMerelini joined SPBD.This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Merelini's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Merelini P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture,  selling smokes to the local community.  Faatafunaina has 3 years of experience in this business.  Faatafunaina needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faatafunaina joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faatafunaina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faatafunaina F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

S. is 56 and married with 6 children (ages 12 - 31).  She owns a art business venture.  Tina has many years of experience in this business.  Tina needs a loan of WST $1700.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nTina joined SPBD.This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tina S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Elenoa S. is 55 and widowed with 2 children (ages 13 and 28).  She owns a business venture selling fruits and vegetables.  Taulafo Elenoa has 2 years of experience in this business.  Taulafo Elenoa needs a loan of WST $1000 0.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  \n\nIn 2008, Taulafo Elenoa joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Taulafo Elenoa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks. Elenoa is a client who willing to help her family as she now rejoins the program.\n\nThe following social metrics for Taulafo Elenoa S. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

K. is 50 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture selling fruit.  Suiti has many years of experience in this business.  Suiti needs a loan of WST $2500 .  She plans to use the earnings from her business to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nSuiti joined SPBD.This is her 5th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Suiti's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Suiti K. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Rosas Rojas (Red Roses) Community Bank is located in the Paute canton, an area known for its warm climate and consequently a major grower of flowers. The largest hydroelectric pwer station is the country is also located there. Its people are very hardworking and dedicated to their jobs, always thinking about helping their families get ahead in life. Our members share their stories:\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda is one of the members of Rosas Rojas Community Bank. She lives in the Paute canton in the Estancia neighbourhood. She is 42 years old and was widowed three years ago. Her husband died overseas but she still doesn\u2019t know from what illness. She lives with her four children aged 21, 18, 14, and 12 as well as her three grandchildren (the children of her oldest daughter who is a single mother). Mar\u00eda and her two older daughters support the family, and she feels secure knowing that she owns her house.\r\n\r\nHer work raising chickens supports the family and provides financial stability. With her first loan received three cycles ago, she began this work. She now has twenty chickens. They are delicate and when they get sick, they die, so she then loses all her investment.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda was invited by her sister-in-law to join this group of feisty women. Now with this new loan she is going to buy young guinea pigs to raise and food for them. Her dream is to see her children in school.\r\n\r\nAnother member of the Bank is Mar\u00eda Azucena R. who also lives in this beautiful canton in Cabo parish. She is an energetic woman who is always pleased to work with her colleagues in the bank. This is her third loan cycle, and the money received to date has helped her with her work raising guinea pigs. She has regular customers who come to her house to buy them. She also sells them in the local market. Mar\u00eda says that she started her first business with her first loan.\r\n\r\nShe is 40 years old and married, but her husband has lived overseas for eleven years. He left the country so he could provide a better quality of life for his children and wife. Thanks to their sacrifices as a couple, they now own their house and the whole family has some security. She lives alone with her four children aged 20, 18, 16, and 13. With this new loan she is going to buy cement blocks, zinc sheeting, and posts to build a much bigger shed and increase the number of guinea pigs. Mar\u00eda\u2019s goal is to continue expanding her business and eventually start raising chickens.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

She owns a business venture, selling BBQ (sausages, chicken, plantains).  Sapani has many years of experience in this business.  Sapani needs a loan of WST $2000 to buy BBQ meat, ketchup, plastic plates & utensils, and coal.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business. Sapani wishes to develop her business and support her family.\r\n\r\nSapani joined SPBD, and this is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sapani's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sapani S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He is 37 years old and has worked for three years as a repairman.  He used to do the same job before but the hours were brutal and, worn out, he resigned.  With a payment that he then received, he bought supplies of clothes and cosmetics and began working as a street vendor, his sales being his sole source of income.  His wife has had three children, all now in elementary school, and what Armando most wants is to give them a good education.  He decided to go back to work as a repairman after some years because his sales were often too little to justify his hard work and the terrible hours he had to work before have improved.  \r\n\r\nHe will use this loan to improve his house.  The walls and floors are unfinished, so he will finish those and add bars to the window and doors to make the house more secure.

A. is a widow with 6 children who make up her family. At the age of 65, she lives in the Quiroga neighborhood of Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia. Her work is selling groceries in a small store she owns. She began as a businesswoman dealing in handicrafts, especially the production of brooms and artificial flowers. Out of this grew the desire to have her own store, which she began in her home using her own resources as well as a loan of 1,000,000 Colombian pesos granted to her by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation in 2003. Since that time, she has received 8 loans, and she has always been careful to repay them on time. She has invested them in her business and also in improvements to her home. Currently, she is requesting financing in the amount of 2,200,000 Colombian pesos for improvements to her home. These funds will be used to replace the roof, repair the pipes and paint the doors and window frames. With respect to the social benefit of the loan, Ligia says that credit from the Foundation has helped her to grow personally along with her business. The business is the main source of her income, and she has gradually been able to renovate her home. She wants to continue expanding her small business and stock it with products that her customers need. \r\n\r\nThe challenges she has faced have included the loss of loved ones such as her husband, her mother and her son-in-law, which she must overcome although they are irreplaceable. \r\n  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

However, they lease four manzanas (a traditional unit of land area in Central America) on which they grow tomatoes, peppers and radishes.  \r\n\r\nSometimes, due to drought or lack of fertilizers, they lose part of the crops in which they have invested all their seed; this makes it very difficult.  For this reason, the need arises to seek financing to buy the necessary manure, fertilizers and seed because they are about to plant tomato and peppers.  They hope to produce good product that will sell at the best market prices so that they can meet household expenses and repay the loan on time.  Her short-term goal is to be able to buy her own farmlands so that her family can have a better future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":497547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy seed, manure and fertilizers for tomato and pepper crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-02-27T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":13000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1.98,"local_amount":41.17,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":42.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604710,"comment":null},{"amount":431.31,"local_amount":8971.34,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:48:01Z","rounded_local_amount":9342.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348337,"comment":null},{"amount":191.71,"local_amount":3987.49,"processed_date":"2011-03-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4152.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766904,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-27T03:24:57Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:07:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":181203,"name":"Martha Lucia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha Lucia Gonz\u00e1lez R. tiene 45 a\u00f1os y vive en el barrio Molinos del Viento, sector de alto movimiento comercial ubicado en la ciudad de Bogot\u00e1, capital de Colombia; tiene 3 hijos en las edades de 11. 15 y 23 a\u00f1os;  es propietaria de \u201cCigarrer\u00eda la mejor\u201d que ha sido el resultado de su disciplina y capacidad emprendedora.

This is their second loan cycle, and the majority of the members are requesting it to revamp their savings.

The extra man in the photo wearing a black jacket is the husband of another member.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Pupa has 1 year of experience in this business.  Pupa needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Pupa joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Pupa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Pupa F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

F. is 25 and married with 2 children.  She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Seutaatia has 1 year of experience in this business.  Seutaatia needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Seutaatia joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Seutaatia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.  Seutaatia joined the program to assist her business development.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Seutaatia F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The main office in the Andes is one of the oldest in the El Alto Region, with the Chulumani being one of the longest standing communal associations, having had 25 loan cycles with Pro Mujer (approximately twelve and a half years).  The businesses that the members conduct are: the sale of footwear, baby clothes, woven sweaters and blankets, canned goods, juices and refreshments, macrame items, cheese and salt, and a grocery store.  Mrs. Agustina Elena R. is 42 years old and married with three children (2 girls and 1 boy).  She has a blanket weaving business during her free time and has been traveling to the cities of Cochabamba and Santa Cruz these past two years, taking school supplies along with her.

Nevertheless, these haven't been the only economic activities that Agustina has undertaken.

These groups pay all together, along with adult associations that generally become like mentors to these young men and women.

Catalina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Catalina is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This will be her 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to further improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

In winter there is heavy snowfall in Kochkor. Everywhere it seems to be silent and only some sounds of cattle can be heard. However, there are people there. Children make snowballs and play games. Adults are busy with their livestock.  Along with everyone else, Asel K., the leader of the group, also deals with her housework, but what makes her special is her youth and determined character. She is a purposeful individual and seeks differences in her life. She is 27 years old, married, a marvelous mother of two children and a good wife. The older child is five and her daughter is two. Her husband works as a welder in an organization, but in his free time he helps in her business. In 2009, they took out a loan to buy cattle and then sold them. For money they have two calves which they are now fattening. They started with 20,000 KGS ($446). At present their revenue is 3,000 KGS ($66) per month. Their plan is to improve their life and be more comfortable by buying a big house. However, at first they want to get a loan to buy a horse to fatten which they would sell in summer. For profit they are going to gather in a harvest crop from the field which they have already bought. \r\n\r\nKubatbek A. is a married man aged 60. His wife is a pensioner. They have a son who helps them. They resell potatoes in the market and have already bought a car for 42,000 KGS ($940). They want to invest the loan to increase turnover which is currently 150,000 KGS ($3,400).\r\n\r\nAida J. K. is 34 and has three children. The elder two attend school and the youngest one is at home. Her husband is a member of a peasant household. She has a business which she began three years ago. She buys old pictures and remakes them for selling. She started with 5,000 KGS ($112) and her profit per month is 5,000 KGS ($112).  They have bought a car for 45,000 KGS ($1,004). She wants to get a loan to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nNurgul I. is 36 and the mother of four children. They all attend the local school. Her husband is a member of peasant households. They have bought a tractor for 50,000 KGS ($1,117). Now she fattens cattle. They began with 20,000 KGS ($446) and now the revenue is 3,000 KGS ($66). By taking out the loan they want to buy cattle to fatten and sell afterwards.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Sometimes you are able to help them. and just because you are not familiar with them. you just walk beside these people not even realizing who they are, and therefore reading these stories is a real way to help people. \r\n<p>\r\nThe heroes of this story are ordinary people from Kyrgyzstan. S. Nurjan, 31, is the leader of this group. She comes from Tokmok, a provincial town in the north of Kyrgyzstan. She is married and has two sons. Her husband works in the military; he is a foreman. Both of Nurjan\u2019s sons were too little to go to school and Nurjan had to stay at home and look after the children. Nevertheless, Nurjan\u2019s sister advised her to start a trade in something, so about two years ago, Nurjan started trading in shoes and socks. Now she has a stable income of about seventy dollars per month. This has allowed her to save some funds and buy some items of furniture for the house. Nurjan is in need of a loan. She would like to invest some funds that would help her to buy more kinds of shoes and socks, which in turn would boost her sales. In near future she is planning to buy a car. Her plans go as far as to buy a three\u2013room flat. \r\n<p>\r\nThese people are Nurjan\u2019s partners:\r\n<p>\r\nAyim is twenty-seven. She lives in Tokmok. Her spouse works in the Border Service of the Kyrgyz Republic. Ayim has a son. Ayim has been fortunate. Due to her husband\u2019s job, she sent her son to a kindergarten and started trading in men\u2019s and women\u2019s shoes. Ayim hopes to obtain this loan and invest the funds to increase the turnover.\r\n<p>\r\nGulnara is 32. She has two children. Since the collapse of Soviet Union, she has been engaged in commerce near a hospital. Now, she plans to sell foodstuffs at school. She needs a loan to purchase goods and foodstuffs to increase the turnover. With the return, she will pay for her daughter\u2019s education. \r\n<p>\r\nAnara is fifty. Her husband took part in the Afghan war and now is retired. Anara has three children. Her eldest daughter goes to high school. The rest are little and stay at home with Anara. Anara needs a loan to make a repair in her flat.\r\n<p>\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"If you ask any person about what he expects, you usually get an answer that he or she hopes to finish school, go to college, find a good job, gradually get promoted and become a boss. However, this ideal path awaits not everybody. And whoever it would be, a person has to be ready to any turn and any situation. The strong people do not expect or dream much about less probable things and just use the best use of the opportunities that life presents for them. \r\n<p>\r\nSiyagul is the leader of this group. Siyagul lives in Tokmok, which is located in the north of Kyrgyzstan, near the border with Kazakhstan. She is fifty-two and has a son. Her son is a grown\u2013up and works in the local municipality. He lives separately from his parents as he has already got an accommodation for himself. Siyagul and her husband are engaged in cattle breeding. They have been doing this for the last fifteen years and have increased the total population of their livestock.  Siyagul has decided to apply for a loan as she is in need of some funds to invest in purchasing 4 sheep for feeding. As the spring is approaching, it is the most suitable time to make such purchases. \r\n<p>\r\nSiyagul\u2019s partners are: \r\n<p>\r\nRahat is twenty-nine. Her spouse provides for the family by working as a taxi driver. Rahat is a mother of two children. She also trades in electric supplies. She has two spots at the local market. Rahat manages to earn about $570 a month. She hopes to obtain this loan and buy more electric goods.\r\n<p>\r\nMunara is thirty-five. She has two sons. Together with her husband, Munara keeps cattle, and on weekends they sell cattle in the market. Munara has applied for this loan as she hopes to buy some more cattle for feeding and resale. \r\n<p>\r\nAdylbek is forty-three. Adylbek\u2019s wife is a saleswoman. They have three children. Adylbek owns a container and also trades in consumer goods. They hope to obtain this loan and invest it in purchasing goods.\r\n<p>\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<p>\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of their customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Probably the main problem that causes most of the uprisings and revolts in Third World countries is the expanding rupture between the rich and the poor. So, what the microfinance organizations have been doing has greatly relieved the situation, as it has given tens of millions of people an opportunity to start their business and improve their standard of living. An amount of money that may seem nothing to a rich businessman, who spends this sum every day having lunch in a restaurant, is to another person vital initial capital, with which he or she could start a new life. And that\u2019s what makes this life interesting! \r\n<p>Erkebubu is the leader of this loan group. She is 49 and the mother of two children. She is raising her children on her own as she has been divorced for the last few years. To provide for her little family, Erkebubu produces national milk soft drinks \u2013 \u201cbozo\u201d and \u201cmaksym\u201d (see http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kyrgyz_cuisine for more information). This seemingly small business has allowed her to make repairs in her apartment. Now her monthly income has reached $420. Erkebubu needs a loan to increase the amount of drinks she sells. She hopes to save money to buy strawberry seedlings.\r\n<p>\r\nErkebubu\u2019s partners are: \r\n<br>Gulmira, 38, is divorced. She has two children and needs a loan for personal use. She is planning to purchase furniture.\r\n<br>Erkingul, 34, is a mother of two children. Her husband provides welding services. Erkingul is engaged in network marketing and sells perfumes, cosmetics and detergents. She is requesting a loan to purchase goods and also buy a TV set with plasma screen. \r\n<br>Chinara is the youngest member of this group at 25 years old. She works as a saleswoman selling bed clothing and dishes. She decided to apply for a loan after her sister advised her to purchase more goods to attract more customers. Chinara\u2019s current monthly income is $185. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

When the economy, way of life, and ideology of the post-Soviet countries began to change, the most farsighted people immediately recognized the necessity of taking up private enterprise. The heroes of this story were such people; the majority of them decided to work at the market.\r\n\r\nMayramkul M. is the leader of this group. Together with her family Mayramkul lives in the city of Karabalta. Mayramkul has three children: a son and two daughters. Mayramkul and her husband found their niche in animal husbandry. They decided to fatten and re-sell livestock and they have been in the business for the last six years. When they were starting out, they sold their cow to buy two bull-calves and fatten them up. Today they have an income of about 14 thousand som from the re-sale of animals. In the last few years they have been able to buy a car and through this business they have the means to send their youngest daughter to the university, paying her tuition. The oldest son is working in South Korea; the middle daughter is married; the youngest daughter is studying at a university and working as a hairdresser. Mayramkul and her husband need the loan to buy a cow for re-sale on the market. In the future they plan to build a large house.\r\n\r\nMayramkul has three partners in the group:\r\n\r\nBakytbek T. is 42 years old. Bakytbek's wife went to Russia to earn money. Bakytbek is the father of two grown children. The son works in construction, the daughter is in college. Bakytbek himself is a carpenter and sells objects made of wood such as handles for axes, dough rollers, and cutting boards. Bakytbek needs the loan to buy construction materials.\r\n\r\nSalima A. is 42 years old; she is the mother of four children. Salima's husband works as a loader at the market. Her daughters work in a sewing shop; one of her sons goes to school and the other is a preschooler. Salima sells potatoes and is requesting the loan to purchase potatoes to sell.\r\n\r\nAzizakhan A. is 42 years old. Together with her husbans she sells vegetables at the market. Azizakhan has five children. The older children are old enough to help their parents with business. Azizakhan needs to loan in order to buy fruit to increase the selection of her goods.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

is a 50-year-old married mother of five children between 14 and 26 years of age, three of whom go to school.  Sarah resides with eight people in her five-roomed house that has electricity but no piped water. She also takes care of additional family members.  The family gets three meals a day. <p>\r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week, Sarah sells charcoal in her community of Katanga, located on the outskirts of Kampala, to an average of 15 customers daily.   She also practices outside catering, incurring extra transport costs to and from shopping.  The major challenges she faces in her business are transportation and rising food prices.  <p>\r\n\r\nSarah has been with MCDT for five years, servicing her eleventh loan working with the same group mates.

Mary herself never went to school due to poverty. Besides her own children, Mary also cares for a niece and nephew.\r\n\r\nMary's business is the sale of general goods, such as soap and candles, and food items, such as seasonings and pepper, onions, and rice.  She has been in business for more than 30 years, and today she sells from a market stall at the Chicken Soup Factory Market in Gardnersville, near Liberia's capital of Monrovia. During the Liberian civil war, Mary and her family fled the country for neighboring Guinea. When she returned to Liberia, she started her general goods business with about 30,000 Liberian dollars in seed money. With her 20,000 Liberian dollar share of this 75,000 Liberian dollar group loan, Mary plans to buy more inventory for her shop.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mary hopes to grow her business and open a store that sells general goods.

Todas las ma\u00f1anas Violeta se levanta muy temprano a preparar estos productos y luego los vende por litros a sus clientes que los consumen en el desayuno.\n\nEste negocio es la unica fuente de ingreso con la que apoya a su hijo, pero ahora que este est\u00e1 creciendo y que ya est\u00e1 asistiendo a la escuela, Violeta siente que los ingresos que percibe no son suficientes para sacarlo adelante. Por ello ha decidido iniciar un nuevo negocio de venta de utiles escolares, aprovechando el proximo inicio de clases escolares en el pa\u00eds. Para lograr este objetivo se encuentra solicitando a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1600 nuevos soles.\n\nVioleta es una mujer trabajadora y que lucha diariamente para salir adelante a pesar de su condicion de madre soltera. Su mayor anhelo es tener una casa en donde pueda instalar un negocio m\u00e1s estable. Ella ya ha trabajado anteriormente con Nuestra Instituci\u00f3n y ha demostrado puntualidad y responsabilidad al momento de asumir sus cuotas.\n","en":"Violeta is 27 years old. She is a single mother and she has an eight year old son. She lives in her parents' home in the Posope Alto sector in an annex to the district of P\u00e1tapo, located forty minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nThe need to get her son ahead made her start selling soy milk and oatmeal four years ago in the streets of Posope. Every morning Violeta gets up very early to prepare these products and later she sells them by the liter to her clients who eat them for breakfast.  \r\n\r\nThis business is the only source of income to support her son. Now that he is growng and going to school, Violeta feels that the income she gets is not enough to get him ahead. Because of this, she decided to start a new business selling school supplies, taking advantage of the new school year about to begin in the country. To attain this goal, she is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1600 nuevos soles.\r\n\r\nVioleta is a hardworking woman and she fights every day to to get ahead despite being a single mother. Her biggest wish is to have a house in which she could set up a more stable business.

Este negocio es de mucha ayuda para la econom\u00eda de su familia, ya que su esposo trabaja como obrero agr\u00edcola en la empresa agroindustrial de la zona y los ingresos que percibe no son suficientes para cubrir los gastos familiares.\n\nDoris nos comenta que gracias a este negocio pudo sacar adelante a sus dos hijos, que ahora ya son independientes. Su negocio goza siempre de buena acogida ya que siempre trata de vender productos frecos y de ofrecer un buen trato a sus clientes. Doris desea ampliar su negocio con la compra de m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda, por ello se encuentra solicitando a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1000 nuevos soles que le ayuden a lograr su objetivo.\n\nSu mayor anhelo es poder vivir en la ciudad para no tener que movilizarse todos los dias del mercado a su vivienda.

She lives with her husband in the rural community of Vichayal, located in the District of Tuman, half an hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nDoris has run a vegetable stand in the Tuman city market for the last ten years. Every day she goes to work, offering her customers cassava [yuca root], corn, onions, potatoes, and all sorts of legumes and root vegetables. This enterprise is a great help to her family's finances because her husband is a field worker for the local agrobusiness company and his income is not enough to cover all of the household expenses.\r\n\r\nDoris has told us that thanks to her business she has been able to help her two children get ahead in life. Both are now grown and living independently. Her sales are good because she always tries to sell fresh products and offer her customers a good deal. Doris would like to expand her business by purchasing more goods to sell. This is why she is asking Edpyme Alternativa [a Kiva Field Partner] for a loan of 1000 Peruvian Soles to help her meet her goal.\r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to be able to live in the city so that she doesn't have to make the long trip each day back and forth from her home to the market.
