Her husband\u2019s job is not stable as he is not working as a permanent employee. <p>It is due to this situation that Yanina decided to work selling traditional crafts, such as hammocks, ceramic jars, wooden chairs, wall decorations, tables, vases, flowers, among other products, to Costa Rica and Honduras. She goes to those countries 2 to 4 times per month. She stays for 3 or 4 days until she sells the last of the products she has. <p>It is through this type of business, and her husband\u2019s economic contribution, that this family has gotten ahead and has been improving its living and housing conditions.

house. This was due to the difficult economic situation in which she found herself at that time. Her husband was without a job, and it was through her business that she was able to feed and educate her 2 children. She now has a small store selling basic goods, which is the fruit of all those years of work. She offers a variety of basic products, such as basic grains, dairy products, breads and pastries, and non-perishable foods. She spends her whole day working in her business, and she is satisfied with what she has achieved. She has plans to expand the space of the business and also to offer new products, with the goal that her customers can have a better variety of products, brands, and prices. Currently, she wishes to increase the inventory of products that she has, because getting them on credit from the wholesaler is a limiting factor for her.

They live in Ticuantepe, an agricultural area with a high potential for eco tourism. For the last 30 years, she and her husband have dedicated themselves to growing the most predominant crop in the area, pineapple, as well as, bananas, oranges, lemons and mandarins (citrus). The municipality has excellent farming conditions because of the climate and arable land, both favourable for agriculture. This is how these parents prepared their children, who are university students preparing themselves for a better life.\r\n\r\n<p>She explains that the production process of different crops includes chemical control of bushes, as the crops need to be free of them to develop properly; to this end, 3 cycles of chemical control -- herbicides and man power -- are needed during this process. Unfortunately, this process is expensive and Darling can't afford it at the moment.  She needs a loan to cover the costs, as the success of her crops depend on it. <b><p>Translated by Beatriz Yuste, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><b>\r\n\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Darling aprendi\u00f3 de su esposo el oficio de la agricultura, quien desde muy joven ha trabajado en el campo, habitan en Ticuantepe una zona altamente productiva con un alto potencial para el ecoturismo.

proceso productivo de los diferentes cultivos requieren de un control qu\u00edmico para la  malezas de las plantaciones durante el desarrollo vegetativo, ya que requieren estar libre de malezas; para ello se debe realizar por lo menos tres controles qu\u00edmicos a lo largo de todo el proceso, a base de herbicidas combinadas con controles manuales y esto tiene un alto costo que ella no puede cubrir en estos momentos, es por eso que necesita un pr\u00e9stamo para poder cubrir esos gastos, ya que de esto depende el \u00e9xito de su

However, vanilla trade is promising for its high price and low maintenance requirement.  In one 12 month harvest cycle, a Vanilla tree requires compost fertilizer and insecticide and herbicide spray once every 3 months.  In June to September, the vanilla trees starts blooming, and at this time I Made Mekir is busy to pollinate he flower to produce fruit.  Vanilla does not produce without human intervention.  Currently, I Made Mekir needs additional capital to pay for a contract labor to help pollenize.  The pollination has to be done in one day window and the flower will wither if not pollinated on time.  Lately, fertilizer and insecticide price is increasing, which makes life harder.

Tanaman Vanili ini telah di tanam oleh I Made Mekir sejak 3 tahun yang lalu dan  sudah dapat sekali panen walau hasil panennya tidak terlalu banyak. Panen yang lalu I Made Mekir mendapat Vanili sebanyak 150 Kg dan harga per  kilogramnya Rp. 35.000.- \/ kg. Namun begitu, tanaman ini sangat menjanjikan. Di samping karena harganya yang sangat mahal, pemeliharaanya tidak terlalu sulit. Dalam satu periode panen yaitu selama 12 bulan, tanaman Vanili membutuhkan perawatan berupa pupuk yaitu pupuk kandang dan semprotan anti hama \/ jamur yang biasanya di lakukan setiap 3 bulan sekali. Pada bulan Juni sampai September,  tanaman Vanili ini  mulai berbunga dan saat itu pula I Made Mekir mulai sibuk untuk mengawinkan bunga Vanilinya agar bisa menghasilkan buah,  karena tanpa bantuan manusia tanaman ini tidak dapat berproduksi . Pada masa ini pula I Made Mekir banyak membutuhkan modal untuk membayar tenaga kerja yang  membantu proses perkawinan itu  karena proses ini harus dilakukan dalam satu hari saja dan bunga akan gugur bila terlambat dalam mengawinkan Belakangan ini harga pupuk dan anti hama mengalami peningkatan sehingga dampaknya sangat dirasakan oleh petani. Begitu juga dengan I  Made Mekir . Dengan pinjaman yang didapatnya, I Made Mekir berharap bisa memelihara Vanilinya lebih baik lagi dan menghasilkan buah lebih banyak ."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":128624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase Fertilizer and Insecticide and Hire Contract Labor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-03-09T07:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"I Made Mekir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-23T15:50:10Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":352852.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189317,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":352852.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217346,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:09:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":352852.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246092,"comment":null},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":352852.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274804,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-08-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":352852.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":304320,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":352852.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335244,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":311111.11,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":324995.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369554,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

Through DINARI, which provides loan and training, Ni Wayan Jendri can buy 2 sows and 6 piglets for fattening. Six months later, each sow can bear 8 piglets, which can be sold for $25 each after being grown for 2 more months. All 8 piglets will bring $400 in sales, while the 6-month expense of each sow is $50. Thus, from each sow, she can expect a monthly profit of $50.

Dari pemeliharaan selama 6 bulan, induk babi bisa beranak 8 ekor  yang bisa dijual dengan harga Rp. 250. 000.- per ekor setelah dipelihara selama 2 bulan. Hasil penjualan 8 ekor itu mencapai Rp. 4.000.000,- Selama enam bulan induk babi menghabiskan biaya sebesar Rp. 500.000,- Jadi dari 1 ekor induk dia mendapatkan tambahan keuntungan sebesar Rp. 500.000,- per bulan.

Despite being unmarried, she diligently supports herself through breeding pigs. At the start of her business, Ni Nyoman Sampir used her own savings to build a permanent pigpen and buy 2 sows. After mating, each sow bore 8 piglets within 3 months. Two months later, each piglet was sold for $25. Looking at this encouraging result, Ni Nyoman Sampir was very excited and wanted to expand her business. This time, she will need some fund to build another pigpen and buy more sows. Ni Nyoman Sampir also plans to hire someone to help her when her business is growing. She will be thrilled and proud of herself when that day comes because, not only that she will grow her income, but also will she provide employment opportunities for others.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Joan, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nNi Nyoman Simpir, 49 tahun, hidup seorang diri hingga usianya yang sekarang ini. Walaupun tidak mempunyai suami, ia tetap tekun dalam menjalani hidup dan usahanya, yakni beternak babi. Awal mula usahanya, Ni Nyoman Simpir bermodalkan dengan tabungannya sendiri. Dari modal tabungan tersebut, ia bisa membuat kandang babi yang permanen dan membeli 2 induk babi.\r\nSetelah induk babinya itu dikawinkan, selama 3 bulan berikutnya induk babi tersebut melahirkan dengan jumlah anak per ekornya sebanyak 8 ekor anak babi. Selama pemeliharaan 2 bulan, anak babi tersebut bisa dijual dengan harga per ekornya adalah Rp. 250.000.- Melihat hasil yang didapatnya, Ni Nyoman Simpir sangat antusias dan berencana untuk mengembangkan usahanya. Saat ini ia membutuhkan dana untuk membuat kandang babi lagi dan sekaligus membeli induk babi. Ni Nyoman Simpir juga berencana untuk mengajak seorang tenaga kerja untuk membantunya nanti kalau usaha nanti bisa berkembang. Ni Nyoman Simpir merasa senang dan bangga kalau nanti usaha bisa berkembang, ia bisa mendapat keuntungan yang lebih banyak lagi dan sekaligus menyediakan lapangan pekerjaan bagi sesamanya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":128674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy sows

Oleh karena itu Ni Nyoman Wati  memutuskan untuk ikut memelihara babi yang didukung oleh program DINARI.

Dengan kredit yang diperoleh, ia manfaatkan untuk pembelian 2 ekor Induk  dan pakan ternak. Selama 6 bulan masa pemeliharaan Induk Babi ini akan melahirkan rata-rata 8 ekor. Sehingga dengan demiki selama 6 bulan pemeliharaan Ni Nyoman Wati menghasilkan 16 ekor anak babi yang bisa dijual dengan harga Rp. 250.000.- per ekor.

After the experience acquired from our first loan that SEM granted to our Association, which has many members, we decided to set up this group with the intention, in the near future, of becoming an effective enterprise, given the support of Kiva and of SEM.  Last winter's rainy season was catastrophic for growers.  And this drove us to the idea of creating a shop for redistributing food stuffs.  This communal enterprise will enable us to work together for the success of our business.\r\n\r\n<p>Background\r\n\r\n<p>Senegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets. Many women are therefore considered not creditworthy by financial institutions in Tanzania, as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support and therefore poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

However, three years ago, with her mother\u2019s financial support, she was able to set up her small home business, in which she sells a variety of products such as undergarments, purses, clothing for men and women, shoes, and perfume. She works from home in order to be close to her children and look after them. <p>\r\nShe is an experienced woman who has managed to help her children get ahead in life.

The work is hard but interesting and takes a lot of effort. Teymur purchases calves, breeds them, and cuts and sells them to the butcher, who works at the local big market. At the same time, the salary is not enough to cover all of Teymur\u2019s family expenses. To increase the profit margin from the selling, Teymur has to invest some money to make his small herd bigger. This winter he applied for $500 to buy four calves. In a half a year their price could be twice as big.
