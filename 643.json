district. Lyra is raising five daughters, two of whom are college students, in her close-knit family.  Her husband, Sultanmurat, is the mainstay in her life. In 2000, the couple decided to start a business breeding cattle, which was begun by buying a cow for 5,000 som (KGS). Through hard work and dedication, her farm now has ten head of sheep and one horse. Also, the family farms 1.5 hectares of irrigated land, where they have planted grasses and beans. In order to further development her business, Lira is asking for a loan in the amount of 50,000 Som (KGS) to increase the number of her livestock.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

Kyrgyzstan). She is married and has two sons and a daughter. Nargiza was born into a simple farmer's family. \r\n\r\nShe was the youngest daughter and has always helped her mother care for the house and her father care for cattle, as her older sister and brothers grew up and moved out. After she finished school, her parents married Nargiza to a guy the same village, and a year later she had a daughter. In the beginning, she and her husband lived with her husband's parents. He worked at a local farm, helping his father care for the cattle and the land on which the whole family grew vegetables and grains. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, they had a son, and in that same year, they sold all of their livestock, and her husband bought Nargiza a small house in his native village. Their parents gave the young family a milk cow and horse, which became the first contribution to their own business. Over time, the little farm grew and so did the family - last year Nargiza bore another son. \r\n\r\nNow Nargiza's farm has four milk cows (allowing the family to have a monthly income of about 15,000 som from the sale of milk), four calves and four horses. To increase the number of livestock they have and area of \u200b\u200bthe barn, Nargiza applied for a loan from Bai-Tushum and Partners for 80,000 Som (KGS).  Nargiza plans to further develop her successful business which will help realize her dream: to buy an SUV. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and investors. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":995.36,"image":{"id":825018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kara-Tube village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:01:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nargiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6149},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5975},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6120},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6268},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6419},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6574},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":6733},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6896},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7062},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7233},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7408},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7163}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.35},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.44},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.7},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.03},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.43},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.91},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.89},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.74},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.68},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":138.35,"local_amount":6149,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6178.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226992114,"comment":null},{"amount":134.44,"local_amount":5975,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":6003.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232751277,"comment":null},{"amount":137.7,"local_amount":6120,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:31:17Z","rounded_local_amount":6149.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238555497,"comment":null},{"amount":141.03,"local_amount":6268,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6298.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244514665,"comment":null},{"amount":144.43,"local_amount":6419,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":6450.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722468,"comment":null},{"amount":147.91,"local_amount":6574,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6605.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125399,"comment":null},{"amount":151.5,"local_amount":6733,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6765.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250546,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-03T18:36:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":322167,"name":"Saliou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"L\u2019emprunteur est un jeune enseignant \u00e2g\u00e9 de 39 ans.

Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.

Her business is the traditional one of making all types of clothing, but mostly school uniforms and outfits for women, and pants.  Since 1995 when she began the business with her daughter with 10 sewing machines and her son-in-law who was in charge of marketing strategy, she has succeeded in getting a lot of business from customers.  For 5 years the results of this business were very good, but her daughter lost her husband  and Maria Cristina couldn't continue working the same way because her daughter got involved in other things, so her sales dropped.\r\n\r\nMaria Cristina has an overlock sewing machine and an industrial machine, and although she handles contracts with businesses and department stores, her market is more domestic with the making of uniforms, multiuse clothing and items taken on order.\r\n\r\nHer goal for the future is to expand the market and generate higher earnings, although her big problem is insufficient working capital to make it happen.  This is the reason she is requesting her first Kivaloan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She will use it to buy basic supplies and a buttonhole maker, improving with this investment the end product of her work.  While Maria Cristina works to fulfill her dream, she hopes to manage a profit of 26% on the sales and to succeed with her dreams by the discipline in her work."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":271.18,"image":{"id":825109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy basic supplies and a buttonhole maker","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Corregimiento la Playa-Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-05T00:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72635},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77179},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78465},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":79773},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":81103},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":82454},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83828},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85226},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":86646},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88090},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89558},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":95043}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.77},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.12},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.65},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.77,"local_amount":72635,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":73406.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803675,"comment":null},{"amount":89.5,"local_amount":155644,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":157296.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614756,"comment":null},{"amount":45.86,"local_amount":79773,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:23Z","rounded_local_amount":80620.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780044,"comment":null},{"amount":46.63,"local_amount":81103,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":81964.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188438,"comment":null},{"amount":47.42,"local_amount":82454,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":83329.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324656,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T00:42:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":322230,"name":"La Rubia Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo La Rubia lo integran tres mujeres trabajadoras, esforzadas y emprendedoras.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.

In the future, Manju plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":261.77,"image":{"id":825155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a young cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-07-29T18:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.73,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manju","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T08:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594797,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":5259,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691537,"comment":null},{"amount":36.77,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.73,"payment_id":244647902,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-28T09:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865034,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275019,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416485,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-29T19:15:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":322256,"name":"Betty Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Betty D. 39 a\u00f1os vive con su c\u00f3nyuge y su hijo D. 13 a\u00f1os D. edad  en la ciudad D.

She lives with her spouse and her 13-year-old son in the city of Barranquilla, in a location very close to the city's commercial zone, where various stores, businesses and informal traD. all coexist. Betty founded a business preparing food which was aimed at employees of companies in the area, with a diversity of dishes. However, her business was not sustainable in this manner, because her customers were provisional workers, and they left, draining a large part of her capital. Determined to sustain herself in this market, she got the idea to sell food by the portion from 2 points of sale. Thus, she now sells rice with mullet and vegetables (a characteristic local dish in Barranquilla), and chicken and rice, which are served on bijao leaves, accompanied by hard-boiled eggs and a corn-based drink, to her customers in an independent manner. She receives help from her husband and her father in the daily operation of the business. She wants to achieve growth with her business, and for this reason she applied for a Kiva loan, her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo foundation. She will use the loan funds to buy raw materials and supplies in greater volume, and thanks to this she will receive discounts and be able to increase her production, initiating her process of entrepreneurial growth. She is grateful for the opportunity to strengthen her business, because it will let her increase her family income, so that together with her husband she can help her children get ahead in life. While she works to achieve her dream, Betty manages her business with a 15-day turnover of accounts receivable, a turnover of 1 day for finished products, and a profit margin on sales of no less than 20%, which she plans to increase with her good performance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":294.38,"image":{"id":825140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy supplies in bulk (rice, oil, root vegetables, etc.).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-05T01:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":77125},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82571},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83947},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":85346},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":86769},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":88215},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":89685},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91180},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":92700},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94245},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":95815},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":102402}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.05},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.03},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.86},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.68},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.26},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.97},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.05,"local_amount":77125,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":79179.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803677,"comment":null},{"amount":48.23,"local_amount":82571,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":84770.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614758,"comment":null},{"amount":49.03,"local_amount":83947,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-18T08:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":86182.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568712,"comment":null},{"amount":49.86,"local_amount":85346,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:40Z","rounded_local_amount":87619.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780045,"comment":null},{"amount":50.68,"local_amount":86769,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:31Z","rounded_local_amount":89080.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188439,"comment":null},{"amount":51.53,"local_amount":88215,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:49Z","rounded_local_amount":90564.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324657,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T03:13:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":322257,"name":"Graciela Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Graciela, se dedica a la venta de mariscos, vive con su esposo y un hijo de 14 a\u00f1os de edad, la casa donde viven es familiar y trabaja desde hace 10 a\u00f1os con la venta de mariscos, ofrece a diario a los clientes diferentes clases de pescado.\nElla actualmente solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de pescado fresco como langosta, camar\u00f3n, corvina, boca colorada entre otras especies que sus clientes consumen, el prop\u00f3sito del financiamiento es comprar todo al contado para luego de las ganancias cubrir las cuotas del pr\u00e9stamo.\nSu objetivo en el corto plazo es comprarse un veh\u00edculo para transportar la mercader\u00eda y de ser posible generar rutas de venta, para poder crecer en clientes y en ventas.\n","en":"Graciela earns a living selling seafood.

","en":"Ricardo is 49 years old and he lives in the community of San Roque in the city of Barranquilla. He lives with his wife and he has 2 children, aged 27 and 33. He has a business in his community through which he produces foods, such as meat skewers, chicken, spicy sausages or traditional Peruvian sausages with sides of vegetables. He and his wife sells these products in quantities to businesses that sell fast foods but they also sell directly to the clients. They have 2 special carts which he designed, measuring 1.1 meters by 60 centimeters and bearing three tires. The front section consists of a roaster and grills, a display, and a storage container in the back where they keep their ingredients. The business idea started out in 1978 in the city of Barranquilla. Prior to this business Ricardo used to travel from fair to fair throughout the entire country. But when he came to sell his products during the Carnaval season, he was inspired by the song of the late Joe Arroyo, named \"En Barranquilla me quedo\", meaning \"I will stay in Barranquilla\". Since then he has established himself in the capital, having seen the potential for commerce. His greatest challenge is his working capital and often it is insufficient to meet the vendors' demand. And this is the reason why he requests a Kiva loan. He will purchase ingredients with which he will prepare his products and he will also purchase tools such as spits, forks, and tongs. He will also purchase plastic containers where to store the condiments. His greatest dream is to have a house of his own and to set up a fast food supply company."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":327.63,"image":{"id":825247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase ingredients to prepare his products and to purchase tools such as spits, forks, and tongs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-03T13:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":86059},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91541},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93296},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":95084},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":96907},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":98764},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100657},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":102586},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":104552},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":106556},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":108599},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":115399}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.4},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.42},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.47},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.2,"local_amount":86059,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":88233.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803680,"comment":null},{"amount":53.4,"local_amount":91541,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":93853.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614760,"comment":null},{"amount":54.42,"local_amount":93296,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-17T08:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":95653.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568714,"comment":null},{"amount":55.47,"local_amount":95084,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":97486.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780047,"comment":null},{"amount":114.14,"local_amount":195671,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":200614.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188441,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-30T00:28:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":322299,"name":"Specoise","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Speciose is a 49-year-old Rwandan entrepreneur with eight children between the ages of five and 23 years old.

Today she owns three tarps and 100 chairs and has built a storeroom in her domicile. She also owns a sewing machine which allows her to vary her income sources so that she can better support her five children, three of whom are enrolled in school.

His wife takes care of their household.\r\n\r\nHe has a small carpentry shop where he carries out various projects such as building doors, furniture, chairs, shelves, and other wood products. He takes orders on his projects and he says he has been in business with his carpentry shop for seven years, and thank God that he has not been without work. He works from Monday to Friday from 8am to 6pm. He buys his materials from a wood depot in the city of Portoviejo.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to purchase more wood, paint, lacquer, nails, glue, and other products he needs for his projects. He has been with his communal bank for the past two loan cycles and he really likes the talks.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to set up a larger shop equipped with adequate tools.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":742606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","use":"to

for its comprehensive support and assistance in the financing of its borrowers. Thanks to your efforts Davronbek is successfully growing his cattle breeding business which allowed him to pay off his first Kiva loan without delinquencies.\r\n\r\nDavronbek was born in the town of Osh in the Osh province of the Kyrgyz Republic. He is married and is raising two children.\r\n\r\nDavronbek was born in the family of a farmer. Since childhood Davronbek helped his father take care of the cattle. At that time his father had a large household and needed help and this is why Davronbek got used to this type of business and dreamed that when he grew up he will also have his own cattle business.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from school Davronbek went to serve in the army. In 1995 when he was 23 years old Davronbek got married and in the same year his first son was born. Later in 1998 he had a daughter. \r\n\r\nDuring the first years Davronbek lived with his family and in his parents' home. Gradually by breeding and selling large horned cattle he was able to save money. In 2002 he decided to invest the money in purchase of his own house in the village of Chaldovar in the Panfilovsky region, Chuysk Province, Republic of Kyrgyzstan where he moved to live. In some time his parents sold out all their cattle and bought a house in the village of Chaldovar where they moved to live not far from their son.\r\n\r\nAt this time because of his entrepreneurship and tenacity Devronbek has five milk cows and two calves. For the purpose of increasing the headcount of cattle Davronbek has come to Bai-Tushum and Partners to take out a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS.

She is 52 years old and married with 3 children. \r\n\r\nRosa was born into an ordinary family. She was the eldest child; she had five brothers and sisters.  Most of her time was devoted to household chores: looking after younger brothers and sisters, housework, and farm work.  As a child, Rosa dreamed of becoming a police officer to protect the innocent and bring justice. After high school, Rose went to military school, then filed documents to apply for a higher education. After graduation, in Soviet times, fate sent Rosa to serve in neighboring Kyrgyzstan, where she met her future husband. Thus, in 1988, our heroine got married, and a year later the newlywed had a daughter. Since both husband and wife were in the military, life threw them from place to place in rented apartments. \r\n\r\nWhile her husband served his country, the years passed and the family grew to five people. \"We have not had time to look around, and it's time to retire,\"  said Rosa. The couple had been saving for a house for fifteen years, and in 2008 they bought a house in the city center of Karabalta.  With the 10,000 som  they had left, Rosa decided to buy some products and try to resell them.  The first batch went well. Rosa realized that she was able to work in trade and selling in the market. For three years, Rosa has increased her turnover to 60,000 som and was able to pay for tuition at the university for her eldest daughter. To further increase sales and expand the variety of goods she sells, Rose turned to the company Bai - Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). She wants to use proceeds from this money to open more shops. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and investors.

Kunduz graduated from pharmacy school and began working at a pharmacy. When she had her son and daughter, she decided find ways to ensure a decent future for them. Since she had experience in trade, in 2008 she decided to open her own pharmacy business. Kunduz leases a shop in Batken Regional Hospital and contracts with local suppliers and producers for medication. Due to the fact that her pharmacy is located within the hospital, the work is non-stop. In order to cover the hours her husband, Turgunbai, helps her, and they work in shifts. \r\n\r\nEach year their inventory increases, and Kunduz's communication skills and customer service brings regular customers and helps the business grow.  To  further develop her business, Kunduz contacted Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS).

She and her husband, Namazbekom, are raising three children. In 2004, the couple started a business in the meat trade, using 10,000 soms (KGS) as seed capital. Because she was able to develop her business and find regular customers, Gulzat now has average income of 6,000-7,000 soms (KGS). Thanks to the hard work they put into their business, the couple were able to begin construction on a large house for the family.\r\n\r\nIn order to further improve and expand her business, Gulzat turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 120,000 som (KGS) to buy thirty head of sheep and goats. With income from the loan, Gulzat plans to complete construction on her house and save money for university tuition for her children.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

Through her friends, Isabel heard about Hluvuku, which she approached, and she has benefited from four loans. They were for expanding her store, and the first loan was for diversifying her products.

He started this business in 1999.  He bought the materials he needed to start with  25,000 Som (KGS). Tilek's work became popular and his business is developing successfully. Tilek's passion for his work motivated his younger brother to become a professional welder, making him a reliable assistant. Working hard and producing quality metal products, the brothers were able to find a circle of regular clients and customers, which provide a monthly income of 6,500 som (KGS), . \r\n\r\nTo increase the range of his products, Tilek has asked Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy iron sheets. With the income from this loan, Tilek plans to build a house and, next year, get married. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.
