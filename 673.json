He lives in the town of Vanadzor.  Samvel's wife works as a teacher at a secondary school, oldest son attends the Yerevan State Medical University, and the youngest son attends school.  Samvel has been involved in carpentry for over 10 years.  He re-purposed one of the rooms in his house into a workshop, where he makes products from wood.  Samvel accepts orders for making furniture and sells wooden souvenirs in a leased space at the city department store.  He also sells table clocks and paintings from Yerevan there.  Samvel's products stand out due to its high quality, taste and mastery.  He cuts very difficult ornaments on the furniture and backgammon, which is why he always has new orders.  This business allows Samvel to support his family and pay for his oldest son's education.  In order to increase his family's income, Samvel wants to start selling ceramic dishwares, vases, statuettes, etc.  He needs a loan in the sum of 1,000,000 dram for this

She is married to Reynaldo who is a driver, and mother to her three children, two are still at home while the eldest is already studying. She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n \r\nErlinda operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons (for other meals) when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Aside from this she also sells fruits in her store. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operationing her business she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nErlinda hopes her business grows and finds a place in the local market, and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":873233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase more

She is married to Wilfredo, a driver, and mother to a child who is now studying in college. \r\n\r\nShe, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAvelina operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. \r\n\r\nAside from this, she also raises pigs in her compound. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 16, 000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAvelina hopes to have her house renovated and dreams of being able to give her child a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":873282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"To pay for

is Rimando, 54, resident of Payatas, Quezon City, Philippines. He is married to Elizabeth, the mother of their children. Rimando, together with his wife and children, manage their household while operating a business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRimando operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries, factories, and others of the like. Rimando's regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of 1000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. He will be incorporating the loan into his current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nRimando hopes to be able to expand soon, just as he fervently hopes that his children will be able to graduate one day and finish their studies. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":873294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","use":"To pay for scrap materials for his business.

The past seven years for this warm-hearted and congenial mother of five have been years of calling forth success in her banana farming business. \r\n\r\nHope principally grows bananas and so far it has been to her advantage. Bananas are a highly favored staple food in most parts of Western Uganda, and on the face of it, people engaged in the sale of bananas are very successful.

He lives alone in his own house and grows crops for a living to improve his lifestyle.  Pasteur gets up early in the morning and goes out to work on his land which is a few kilometers from his house.  He grows citrus fruit such as oranges, grapefruit and lemons, and regional products such as yucca, banana and potatoes.  When he was young he inherited the land from his parents, who taught him how to plough the land and plant the crops, and since then he has been involved in this business.  During harvest time he has to hire help to harvest the fruit.  Then he takes his produce to the local market where he sells both wholesale and retail.  He also has clients who are wholesalers, so he takes his produce to the city of Lima.  He hopes to expand his business.

Two of them are still in school and dependent on her.  Throughout her life, Eutemia has been engaged in a variety of commercial activities.  Because of this, in order to continue to improve herself, she decided to study pastry making.  With the skills she obtained she decided to start her own business selling desserts.  She currently makes cakes, turnovers, tarts and other delicacies that she then sells to schools and stores.  Thanks to her hard work she was able to buy a motorcycle that one of her sons works.  She tells us that she also knits sweaters, shawls, etc. to generate a little extra income for her home.\r\n\r\nOne of Eutemia\u2019s plans for the future is to set up a bakery at home where she can sell all sorts of desserts.  She plans to use the requested loan to invest in her pastry business buying flour, sugar, eggs and milk, among other ingredients because she has orders to fill.\r\n\r\nEutemia is a member of the \u201cVirgen D. Guadalupe\u201d communal bank which has 10 hardworking, responsible members who have had no repayment problems.  They commit to continue to work well with the Prosperidad Program.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3575,"image":{"id":873770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy flour, sugar, eggs and milk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2011-09-21T16:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eutemia Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Giannina Nataly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lizbeth Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aniceta Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonidas Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9700,"loan_amount":3575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1616.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":595.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":595.84},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":595.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":595.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":595.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":595.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2285.05,"local_amount":6200,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6235.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232777686,"comment":null},{"amount":1289.95,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3520.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250751333,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T21:17:04Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:48:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":337478,"name":"Blanca Cecilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Blanca, vive con sus hijos ella mantiene  a su familia, se dedica a vender tostadas, enchiladas, yuca frita, en su familia de eso trabajan, y ella lo aprendi\u00f3,  ya tiene 6 meses de realizarlo todos los d\u00edas, sale a vender a las casas de lunes a domingo.\nEl pr\u00e9stamo lo quiere para comprar m\u00e1s materia prima para elaborar el producto  y de esa manera tener variedad y obtener mejores ingresos, comprando platanos verdes, yuca, condimentos y maiz.\nEl sue\u00f1o de Blanca es tener lo necesario para  mantener el negocio, y generar m\u00e1s ingresos para su familia ya que es soltera y no tiene ayuda de nadie.\n","en":"Blanca lives with her children.

This will help her to make a better income, allowing her to better sustain her family and cover her youngest child's school costs. One of her challenges has been that one of her grandchildren does not walk or speak, and normally has to be hospitalized. This is very expensive.
