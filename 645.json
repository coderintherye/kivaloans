This investment will be successful thanks to the vast experience she has in the marketplace and because it will be based on prior orders and on the products that turn over most quickly in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":268.32,"image":{"id":827287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy general merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Turbaco-Bolivar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-04T18:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":70437},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76259},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77721},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":79211},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80729},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":82276},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83853},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85460},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":87098},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88768},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90469},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":97719}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.85},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.69},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.55},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.3},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.08},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.5,"local_amount":70437,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":71768.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803683,"comment":null},{"amount":43.85,"local_amount":76259,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":77700.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614762,"comment":null},{"amount":44.69,"local_amount":77721,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:24Z","rounded_local_amount":79189.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568717,"comment":null},{"amount":45.55,"local_amount":79211,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:48Z","rounded_local_amount":80708.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780049,"comment":null},{"amount":93.73,"local_amount":163005,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":166085.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188444,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-27T19:05:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":323104,"name":"Lolo Sabino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Lolo Sabino, es padre soltero, tiene dos hijas mayores de edad, las cuales no viven con \u00e9l. \nSe dedica  a la  fabricaci\u00f3n de puertas y ventanas, eligi\u00f3 este tipo de trabajo  por familiares  que se dedican al mismo rubro, trabaja desde  hace seis a\u00f1os y gana aproximadamente trescientos soles semanales.

He sells uppers, soles, insoles, buckles and a variety of accessories that are used by shoemakers to adorn their shoes. He learned this business through family tradition, as his family has been in the same line of work ever since they lived in his hometown of Bucaramanga, a place also called \"the city of parks,\" which is located in the department of Santander del Sur.  Although he has been building up experience since he was 15 years old, he had always worked in the family business.  A year ago, he became independent so that he could generate his own income, because as he is an adult with a 1 year-old child, he had to start thinking about the development of his family with his wife.  His main challenge is that he doesn't have enough capital, and this makes him less competitive since he loses customers.  This is the reason that he is applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing that he has gotten through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the loan, he will buy accessories for shoes and materials and supplies such as uppers, soles, insoles and buckles in large quantities so that he can get a bulk discount.  But above all, he will be able to have a greater assortment of items that will allow his new customers to have a better view of his business.   Meanwhile, he maintains a 55 day inventory turn-over, and profitability of no less than 20 percent.

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 en vol\u00famenes telas e insumos, para aumentar la producci\u00f3n y responder a su clientela, la cual demanda productos con nuevos y modernos dise\u00f1os. . Mientras Robinson trabaja para lograr sus metas, maneja en su negocio un margen de utilidad no menor del 25 % que poco a poco planea aumentar y una liquidez de 3 a 1. Su desaf\u00edo m\u00e1s importante es ver a sus hijos convertidos en profesionales de \u00e9xito y es que ellos son especialmente el motor de su vida.","en":"Robinson is 50 years old and lives with his wife and their two children, 10 and 22, who are both students.  He lives in a very friendly neighborhood of hard-working people to the south of the city.  There he makes clothing such as pants and women's shirts for a living.  He learned this activity, even though he didn't have any prior experience, thanks to his sister who, for many years, worked in a clothing company.  There was a time when he felt hopeless because he didn't have a job and she made him her manager.  There he learned how to make clothing and operate the machines and this is precisely what he has been doing with his life.  With his sister's help he was able to buy his own house and organize it, in addition to the many achievements that have contributed to his happiness.  Now his young daughter is following in his footsteps as she is very attached to him and watches him work.  In her free time she plays at making clothing for her dolls.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Robinson's business is generating jobs and he plans to increase his production through the use of working capital that he will obtain through loans.  This is the reason he is requesting a Kiva loan which he will use to buy fabrics and supplies in volume to increase his production and respond to his customers who demand new and modern designs.  While Robinson works to attain his goals, he manages his business with a profit margin of no less than  25% which he plans to increase little by little and a liquidity of 3 to 1.  \r\n\r\nHis greatest challenge is to see his children become successful professionals as they are what drives him in life.

It is located 5km from the city's airport, next to the towns of Soledad, Sabanagrande, and Santo Tom\u00e1s. It has a unique social composition, due to the fact that its inhabitants are a mix of people from all over the country. They come to work either independently through starting a business, or to work in the Malambo Industrial Park (PIMSA), a privately-owned industrial development.  It provides a complete infrastructure of services, designed to ensure cost reductions for the companies that locate there, who can also count on the availability of sufficient labor.   \r\n\r\nLeticia has been making clothing for more than 30 years, and with her mother and her siblings succeeded in advancing their personal well-being, and that of their whole family. That's why once her mother passed away 11 years ago, she took over the reins of the business, to keep it going with everyone's support.  Her clothing business has been growing little by little, from its beginnings until today.  Initially, her infrastructure consisted of just one machine. Today she has three, plus a serger, as well as a sales outlet or sewing sundries store where she sells her production and dress-making supplies.  \r\n\r\nShe is taking advantage of the growing market in the municipality, which consists mainly of the schools in Malambo, who have their uniforms made by her business. Her strength is her reputation in the community, and the strategic location of her business. Their common goal is to increase production of casual clothing, because this has great unexploited potential. However, her working capital is insufficient to achieve this; this is the reason she is applying for a Credikiva loan.  She will use it to buy, in greater volume, cloth and other materials for making clothing for her business and to make new designs that are in fashion, and that her customers have asked for.  \r\n\r\nHer personal dream is to succeed in offering her son the opportunity to study for a profession, to some day see him as a successful professional and feel that she has done her duty."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":269.94,"image":{"id":828378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy cloth and dress-making materials for her business, and for making new designs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-13T16:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72993},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76308},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77771},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":79262},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":80781},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":82329},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83907},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85515},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":87154},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88825},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90527},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":94628}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.72},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.57},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.11},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.97,"local_amount":72993,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":74372.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320551,"comment":null},{"amount":43.88,"local_amount":76308,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":77750.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803692,"comment":null},{"amount":44.72,"local_amount":77771,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":79240.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614770,"comment":null},{"amount":45.58,"local_amount":79262,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-18T08:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":80760.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568726,"comment":null},{"amount":46.45,"local_amount":80781,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":82307.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780057,"comment":null},{"amount":47.34,"local_amount":82329,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":83885.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188452,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-24T14:40:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":323136,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana tiene 34 a\u00f1os vive en la ciudad de Otavalo en San Luis v\u00eda a Punyaro con sus hijos, es soltera, sus hijos tienen 14 y 10 a\u00f1os.\n\nAna es una persona feliz, trabajadora con muchas ganas de salir adelante.\n\nTrabaja en la confecci\u00f3n de pijamas para ni\u00f1os con sus hermanas, trabajaba con su hermana desde hace 3 a\u00f1os, le hacian trabajar demaciado y ten\u00eda un salario bajo, en la actualidad le va bien en el trabajo tiene muchos pedidos.\n\nTrabaja por primera vez con FODEMI, el prestamo que solicita es para la compra de tela polar para la confecci\u00f3n de las pijamas y con este pretamo podr\u00eda aumentar su producci\u00f3n y el beneficio para su familia.\n\nSu sue\u00f1o es poder construir una casa para poder tener una mejor calidad de vida jnto a su familia.","en":"Ana is 34 years old and lives in the city of Otavalo in San Luis, by way of Punyaro.

She walks to the community of Union Palomar where she cares for and fertilizes the plants and pulls out the weeds. She has been working in agriculture for 5 years now, and what she likes the most is being able to dedicate time and effort to something that is her own. After each harvest she sells the coffee beans in the Alto Palomar cooperative. Dany is not just a farmer, but has also been working for 4 years as a teacher in the Peruvian social service, which strives to teach children older than 3 to read, write and improve their psycho-motor activity.\r\n\r\nNow she is working to improve her crops so that she can get better profits from her sales. She belongs to the village bank \"La Union Hace la Fuerza de Palomar\" and this is her second loan with MFP. She hopes to get a small loan to help achieve her objectives. She promises to make her payments punctually. Upon receiving your support, Dany will invest the requested money in the purchase of some sacks of natural fertilizer to scatter among her coffee plants. Her plans are to clean out the underbrush from her fields and transplant the seedlings when they are ready to produce good coffee.

They live together as a family in their own home, located in the locality of La Union Palomar (central Peruvian jungle). The primary product of this region is coffee. But Oscar has been planting not only this product but also bananas, corn, and yucca for the past 20 years.  These produce good harvests and as a result, good earnings. But as a good agriculturist he is inexhaustible so when he has some spare time (which is not much!) he works as an electrician as promoted by the Peruvian state, bringing electricity to the distant villages in the Peruvian Amazon. With the funds he generates with this employment, Oscar hopes to obtain extra funds to improve his cultivations. He wants to be recognized not only by his buyers but also by the coffee cooperatives who are always in search of good coffee beans. He has already taken the first step with the orientation he received. He learned about the germination process, packaging, and coffee plant transplantation. He is a member of the communal bank \"La Union Hace la Fuerza del Palomar\", meaning \"Unity is the Strength of Palomar\" and it is his second loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner). He is proud to be part of a communal bank where the members are very responsible and honest. This is the reason he will make his payments on time. Oscar, on receiving this support, will invest the funds he requests in the purchase of several sacks of natural fertilizers, to apply as per the knowledge he acquired through his orientation."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":828675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase several sacks of fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-08T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-08-09T22:09:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":323154,"name":"Yolima","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" Yolima de 35 a\u00f1os es la propietaria de \u201cCosas y cositas Jehov\u00e1 Yir\u00e9t\u201d, negocio donde  vende prendas de vestir, zapatos y accesorios en la l\u00ednea masculina y femenina, ella tien una experiencia  de  con 3   y  como propietaria del negocio tiene un a\u00f1o.

Yoliva started her business as a great opportunity. She started out as an employee, working for the first two years. When Yolima took over the reins, managing the business, the owner was motivated to sell her the business when she was going to relocate. And she bought it by making payments. She makes her purchases in the cities of Bucaramanga and Medellin. Her business operates with a steady client base, passers-by, and especially with the population in the sector. Her plan is to develop a new sales strategy. The plan consists of giving buyers the opportunity to lay way the product they wish to buy with an initial payment. The person can make payments until the full price is met and at that time they receive their product. Yolima wants to expand her business and she wants to invest to improve the selection and to supply it to meet the emerging needs of her clientele. For this reason she requests a Kiva loan. It is the first loan she accesses through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). She will purchase articles of clothing, shoes, and ladies' accessories. Financially speaking, this burins enjoys steady sales which are generally completed in cash. The current assets represent cash and credit sales.

The business grew gradually, and gave her the opportunity to repair her home and prepare the premises from which she operates today. Jovita's greatest satisfaction with her business is that the income it has generated has enabled her to sponsor her children's professional education. Also, it introduced her to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo 17 years ago. Since then, Jovita has received 25 loans through this institution. Through her wise investments and a lot of discipline these loans facilitated many of Jovita's successes, including the education of her children and improving her home.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kyrgyzstan), where she still lives now. She is 58 years old. She was the third child in a large low-income family. From an early age she had to help her mother with household duties, which is why she  completed only seven grades of primary school. At 22, she got married. Before long she had a son and later on two daughters. At that time, Damira\u2019s husband started raising sheep, but this work was not particularly profitable. However, steady income was necessary to support the growing family. And this is how, lacking formal education and practical knowledge, Damira decided to go into retail.\r\n\r\nLike many in a similar situation, Damira started by selling at the local market. With three children to feed and without a reliable source of income, working as a vendor was the only opportunity to have earnings. After much effort, her first year of entrepreneurship turned out to be successful. The starting capital amounted to 4,000 KGS, and already after the first year of work Damira was able to increase her investment. After selling food items at a market for five years, Damira was able to buy a pavilion and open a small grocery store near her home. From then on, retail became a family business. Her son got married, her older daughter too, while the younger daughter started helping with the business. In 2009 Damira obtained her first loan for 100,000 KGS from \u201cBai Tushum and Partners\u201d and built a store  on her own land plot.  Her retail work started to bring in a steady income; the number of customers kept increasing. \r\n\r\nThen the family had to face an emergency: Damira\u2019s only son was seriously injured in an automobile accident and  required expensive medical care. Around that time, her granddaughter was born, which necessitated further expenses.\r\n\r\nAt present Damira plans to receive her next loan for 100,000 KGS in order to expand her selection of goods and   buy a new refrigerator for her store.\r\n\r\nThe MFC \u201cBai Tushum and Partners,\u201d CJSC offers loans through Kiva for socially vulnerable populations.

He is 26 years old, is married and has no children. He finished twelfth grade. Ramos lives in his mother's house and supports her and his three siblings, who live with him in the house.\n\nRamos took the teaching course, and because he is the oldest in the house he is responsible for the family. He is a teacher and has been a permanent employee for more than eight years, working as a school principal and earning 9,060 meticais per month, which he uses for household expenses. With the loan Ramos intends to first finish a house for his mother and then begin construction of his own house with conventional materials.

With the income he earns he is able to cover his family's expenses.  \r\n\r\nIn order to continue with this activity he has requested a loan of 2000 nuevos soles [Peruvian currency] through Edpyme Alternativa.  He will use the loan to buy scrap metal (recyclable products) and make repairs to his motorcycle as it is having mechanical problems.  Abat is a responsible and hard-working person.  The only thing he wants is for his family to excel and get ahead.

What she most enjoys about her work is the harvest season because this is when she is able to see all of her efforts materialized and she is able to sell the food products in the wholesalers market in the city of Tarma. Currently she wants to improve the quality of her plantation to be able to earn the necessary capital funds to start up a grocery store in her locality. \r\n\r\nShe is a member of the communal bank \"Linda Amanecer de Cumutay\", meaning \"A Beautiful Dawn in Cumutay\". It is her second loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she hopes to have your support in helping her reach her objectives. She is committed to making her loan payments on time. Nilda, on receiving your support, will invest the funds she requested in the purchase of a sack of pea seeds to successful start up her next plantation.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":836706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a sack of pea seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-12T12:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1028.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245350,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-14T12:57:00Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":323381,"name":"Olga Dariela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Olga es una madre D. familia D. 31 a\u00f1os D. edad, vive con su familia en su casa propia, la cual cuenta con servicio s\u00f3lo D. luz, ubicado en la zona urbana del departamento D.

She is an exemplary woman who works hard, alone, to earn a living and provide an appropriate quality of life to her 3 children. As a family, they live in the settlement of Cumutay, in a humble home. She reports that her oldest son left home in search of a better future. Being both mother and father to her children is a difficult task which Juana has faced bravely since her partner, without caring about anything, abandoned them when his offspring were still small. \"To fill the pot,\" as she says, for the past 20 years she has worked growing potatoes (a Peruvian variety of this root crop), peas and corn. She has also raised various heads of livestock, two asses and some sheep and pigs. She reports that \"at first they confused me because I didn't know which one to take care of first, but now things have changed and thanks to God, my children are big and they help me at times, even when I am limited to preparing lunch because of the pains that plague me.\" She also says that she always likes to see her fields clean and neat because they are well-cultivated. She considers her work worthwhile because of the satisfaction and achievements it provides her in life, so that she wants to keep planting. In addition, it is the only work that she knows. She belongs to the \u201cLindo Amanecer de Cumutay\u201d [\"Beautiful Dawn of Cumutay\"] communal bank, and this is their ninth loan with MFP, from which she expects a small loan so that she can fulfill her objectives. She also promises to be punctual with her payments. When Juana receives her support, she will invest the funds she is requesting in buying a bag of pea seeds and several sacks of natural fertilizers so she can get her next planting off to a successful start.

She\u2019s currently a member of the \u201cSomos Impacto 2006\u201d (We are Impact 2006) communal bank that has 9 members who carry out a variety of commercial activities.  \n\n\nDina Ygnacia has worked for the last 30 years selling anticuchos (grilled, skewered meat fast food), pancita (grilled pig stomach) and daily meals.  The business arose from her divorce because she had to work to support her two children so she started to sell anticuchos at her front door and in time became better known and started to get larger numbers of customers and the business started to grow and she earned better profits and started to build her house.  Today, she rents her house and continues selling anticuchos and daily meals.\n\n\nDina Ygnacia tells us that everything she got she acquired through much effort and perseverance because her children were her motivation and her desire to get ahead was bigger than her problems.  Thanks to her effort and dedication she\u2019s attained better income and her children are now adults who have established a clothing manufacturing firm.  Above all, she has good quality of life. \n\n\nWith the goal of continuing to continue growing, she\u2019s asked for a new loan to buy ingredients.  We know that Dina Ygnacia will meet her goals with much effort and work and that Edaprospo loans will help her.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":836909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"to buy meat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huaycan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.083333 -76.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2011-08-15T21:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dina Ygnacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Berenice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4600,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1165.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227018245,"comment":null},{"amount":425,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1165.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232777614,"comment":null},{"amount":425,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1165.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238582124,"comment":null},{"amount":425,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1165.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244540575,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-15T23:04:35Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:40:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":323412,"name":"Ivan Arturo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ivan lives and works in Pedro Vicente Maldonado, a canton in the west of the province of Pichincha in Ecuador.

The other children are adults and live independently.  He has worked in agriculture from a very early age and remembers how the members of the community used to help each other mutually on their croplands, so he knows teamwork is important for things to work well.  Now, with the help of his oldest son, he plants potatoes and peas on his own cropland.  After days of hard work their compensation is a good quality harvest.  Since the family is quite large they do not have to hire workers and, thanks to this agricultural work, he has been able to help his children get ahead.  Therefore he considers his work to be profitable although the harvest is not always good, due to plague or bad weather; but there is always money to be made selling to the wholesale dealers in the city.  \r\n\r\nManuel also raises cattle in an effort to expand his business.  He belongs to the communal bank \"Lindo amanecer de Cumutay\" and this is his fifth loan through MFP.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Imelda's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 1500 on sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan.
