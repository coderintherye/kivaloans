She earns her living by operating a general store and selling livestock supplies. Her husband Emmanuel, who is 43 years old, works as a teacher to earn his living.

With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Julie Joy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

is a married woman who lives in Narra, Palawan. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  pig fattening, meat dealing\/livestock and farming. Her husband Luis, who is 37 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have two children who are 6 and 11 years old. Delba joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Delba has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,900, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000  to fund her livestock and farming operations and purchase more meat so that she can continue to save up for her children's education and the improvement of her business. Delba is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her

is a 44-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a fishing\/fish vending business and a rice retailing business.  She lives in the municipality of Narra, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing\/fish vending and rice retailing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,500. Elizabeth is borrowing PHP 18,000 to fund her business operations.  This will be her ninth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Elizabeth aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.

is a married woman who lives in Manapla, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband Edwin, who is 40 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living. They have two children who are 5 months and 11 years old. Necole joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Necole has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13, 000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs. Necole is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

is a married woman who lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, electronic re-loading and farming. Her husband Leo, who is 41 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living. They have three children who are 6 to 10 years old. Merle joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Merle has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly income of PHP 30,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.

With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: fruit vending, a general store and an eatery. Her husband Nelson, who is 46 years old, works as a technician to earn his living. They have five children who are between 10 and 20 years old. Rosmary joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosmary has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 30,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for her children's education and house repair. Rosmary is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Julibel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her third loan, she is borrowing PHP 7,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for her children\u2019s education.

She lives in the municipality of Rizal, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2010 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her food market and rice retailing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,900.  Janifer is borrowing PHP 10,000 to purchase more stocks to sell.  This will be her second loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Janifer aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.

is a 42-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures: smoked fish, dried fish and fishing. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1997 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 100,000. Jasmin is borrowing PHP 40,000 to purchase fishing gear and equipment. This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 35,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

By working hard in her fishing\/fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000. Luvizminda is borrowing PHP 25,000 so that she can purchase fishing gear and equipment. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

is a married woman who lives in Cebu. She earns her living by weaving abaca. Her husband Alejandro, who is 54 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 18 and 28 years old. Nemesia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nemesia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy abaca fiber for weaving and also to pay for other operating expenses so that she can continue to save up for future family needs.

is a married woman who lives in Bais City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband Eduardo, who is 57 years old, works abroad as an OFW - overseas filipino worker so that he could save enough to secure his family's future, as well as be able to afford to send his children to college when they grow up. Their  two children who are 9 and 16 years old, are currently going to school. Bernarditha joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she also aspired to do something to improve her family's future wellbeing. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bernarditha has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to purchase merchandise to sell in her general store so that she can continue to support her family's day to day expenses and her children's school expenses as well as save up for future house renovations and to send her children to school. Bernarditha is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her

T. is from the town of Plaridel. She is 40 years old. Letecia is widowed and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Letecia owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Letecia has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Letecia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Letecia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Letecia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 12th loan taken out by Letecia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been a real estate agent for the past 30 years, and a real estate broker for the last two.  Lydia got into the real estate business after buying her first home.  She says a poor understanding of the business side of home buying made her feel vulnerable throughout the process and motivated her to educate herself.  She took courses in real estate management, which eventually led to her becoming a certified real estate agent.  Lydia holds a bachelors degree from Texas State University, from which she graduated Summa Cum Laude in 2005.\n\nBeing a certified real estate broker means she has the credentials to manage her own real estate business without operating through a middleman.  Lydia has a small office with a conference room where she can meet with clients.  She says that meeting a potential client is much like an interview, and that having an office gives her business professional credibility.  In addition to herself, Lydia currently has one real estate agent that works for A Plus Real Estate.\n\nWhen Lydia decided to start A Plus Real Estate, she wanted to do it alone, without any outside financing.  This strained her resources.  Early on, she invested too much of the company\u2019s revenues back into the business, assuming she could pay herself with future business transactions.  Overextended, she found herself in a bind when business temporarily slowed.  She soon realized paying cash for everything was not practical, and decided it would be prudent to take out a small loan to help cover operating expenses.\n\nShe first heard of ACCION Texas-Louisiana years ago through a San Antonio Express-News article written about the organization and its CEO, Janie Barrera.  Lydia found the article inspiring and saved it.  When she decided to apply for a loan, she remembered the article and decided to apply through ACCION Texas-Louisiana.\n\nLydia never wants her business to grow to the point that it costs her customers quality of service.  She says she would someday like to have 10 real estate agents with A Plus Real Estate, but says she does not want to overextend herself and wants her business to grow naturally.  This summer, she expects to be ready to hire an additional two agents.\n\nCheck out her business at http:\/\/www.bestsanantoniodeals.com\/.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":727282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Help covering operating expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Antonio, Texas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2011-03-10T21:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1672,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":124.27},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":130.29},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":132.98},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":134.31},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":136.94},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":138.46},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":140.57},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":143.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":144.92},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":147.35},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":149.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":149.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.49},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.53},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.22},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.55},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.18},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.71},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.35},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.18},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.61},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":124.49,"local_amount":124.27,"processed_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":124.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201207801,"comment":null},{"amount":130.53,"local_amount":130.29,"processed_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":130.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206076703,"comment":null},{"amount":133.22,"local_amount":132.98,"processed_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":133.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211145772,"comment":null},{"amount":134.55,"local_amount":134.31,"processed_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":134.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216431402,"comment":null},{"amount":137.18,"local_amount":136.94,"processed_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":137.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221596324,"comment":null},{"amount":138.71,"local_amount":138.46,"processed_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-29T07:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":138.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226966200,"comment":null},{"amount":140.82,"local_amount":140.57,"processed_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-28T07:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":140.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232725037,"comment":null},{"amount":735.5,"local_amount":734.18,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-23T08:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":735.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238529085,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-16T11:12:06Z","paid_date":"2011-11-23T08:44:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":279830,"name":"Lovette Kinnie's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT), a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone, is pleased to present to you this group of teachers from one of the primary schools in Blama, a town in eastern Sierra Leone.   \n\nThe teachers of this school have come to SMT for a loan of SLL 5,600,000 in order to improve on their standards of living. Some of them will use this loan to buy house building materials, some to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay school fees for their children, and so on.

Now in its seventh year of operations, 3rd Eye Surveillance has grown beyond its founders to include an additional full-time employee and four independent contractors.  Besides selling surveillance systems, 3rd eye surveillance also sells pepper spray and other violence-deterring products.\r\n\r\nAt first, the majority of 3rd Eye Surveillance\u2019s business came from installing security systems at apartment complexes.  Offie ran the business, while Marie had another full-time job that helped support themselves and their two children.  When Marie quit her job to help run 3rd Eye Surveillance, she helped make their business HUB-certified (Historically Underutilized Businesses).  She says this certification makes them eligible for government contracts, and makes them more attractive to large corporations.\r\n\r\nMarie and Offie want to start selling security systems wholesale to other independent contractors and have the contacts in place to begin importing.  They need financing to help them with the high start-up costs.  Because Marie and Offie had been paying cash for their purchases, their credit score kept them from getting a loan from commercial banks.  Marie is using this loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana to build her credit score, so that she can qualify for a larger loan this summer.  She and Offie ultimately want to receive financing so that they can begin importing surveillance systems to sell wholesale.\r\n\r\nMarie and Offie donate and install free surveillance systems for organizations that need added security but lack the resources to pay.  For example, they donated and installed a surveillance system for the Genesis Women\u2019s Shelter.  They have also donated surveillance systems to churches and retirement homes.\r\n\r\nCheck out their website at

With the help of her past 21 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Melanie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

L. is 34 years old and lives in the town of Soyapango, in the department of San Salvador. She lives together with her life partner and two children, aged 14 and 9. Sonia owns a store in which she sells perishable products and necessities for the home. This business has made it possible for her to receive extra earnings, which provides her and her husband with the necessary funds to make their house payments on time, and also to have food and other things they need to live with dignity. For this reason, Sonia would like to stock her store with more products, and thus she is requesting a loan, which she will use to buy rice, beans, sugar, dairy products, and others.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 600 WST or about $250 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nSapani joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Sapani's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. \n\nAnnabella is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 14th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

R. is 43 years old and lives in the state of San Salvador, with her parents, brother and four children: Norma, Gabreila, Berenice and Francisco, who are economically dependent on Doris. For more than 15 years she has made tortillas, in an area located above one of the principal streets in the capital of El Salvador, known as Alameda Juan Pablo Segundo. She makes the tortillas both at noon and in the afternoon, which guarantees a lot of customers and high sales. This is very important to her, as it is her only form of income since she is a single mother. For this reason, she is asking for a loan to purchase maize (corn) and lime to significantly improve her sales.  \n\nMaize and lime prices have recently risen. Lime, an ingredient that is used to cook the maize, is put into the fire along with the maize. The proportion that is used depends on if the maize is being used for tortillas or for delicious traditional tamales.  Thanks to the lime, the maize sheds its shell, and is cleaned. Without the use of lime, Doris would have very grainy tortillas, and her sales would be greatly diminished. \n\nOne of Doris's biggest hopes is to help her business to grow and she is sure that with this loan she will be able to make this happen so that her family can live better.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":727653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMariefe is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Mariefe owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector managing a handicrafts business. The main source of income for the business comes from selling handicrafts home products to tourists and local community members. Mariefe has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mariefe joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mariefe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials needed to make products for sale. Mariefe is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Mariefe from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Corales' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pamela C. is from the village of Union, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is the leader of a seven-member group loan offered by Kiva partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\nPamela is 33 years old, married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Pamela owns and operates a general store selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Pamela has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 6,000 PHP per month from these activities.\nIn 2010, Pamela joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Pamela is requesting a new loan of 16,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her third from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \n\nAbout ASKI\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":723612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is a married woman who lives in Brooke's Point, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a sound and light equipment rental business and selling fish. Her husband Artemio, who is 44 years old, works as a government employee to earn his living.  They have five children who are between 11 and 19 years old. Divina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Divina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

Eng L. earns a living by weaving rattan baskets and selling wooden beds.

B. is from the village of Catarman. She is 50 years old. Myrna is married and has four children. To make a living, Myrna owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Myrna has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Myrna joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myrna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. Myrna is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the 20th loan taken out by Myrna from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Nelson has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP when he sells one of his raised pigs.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nelson joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nelson has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Nelson is requesting a new loan of 18,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Nelson from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

The kiosk is located at the roadside, so it is easy for his customers to access the premises to buy goods to meet their needs. Prior to running the business, Samuel used to do odd jobs to support his family, but the income generated was unstable and sometimes insufficient for meeting the needs of the family. He and his wife Susana, age 36, are blessed with two children: Sami, age 9, who attends third grade in the elementary school, and Arjen, age 5. Samuel and his family live in Naikoten Village in Kupang City.\r\n\r\nSamuel began his business using his own small capital. He is happy with his current business, not only because he does not have to look for odd jobs every day but also because he dreams of improving it so as to better provide for his family. Samuel joined TLM Group Lending Program and has received loans in the amount of IDR 500,000 in the first loan cycle and IDR 750,000 in the second. Samuel's business has improved since he received these loans. He used the money to stock more basic materials to be sold in his kioask, such as noodles, coffee, sugar, teabags, soap, detergent, and rice. \r\n\r\nSamuel plans to expand his business by adding more products and to renovate his business place. He is requesting a loan of IDR 4,000,000. Samuel is hoping that TLM will assist him with a loan to help make his dream come true.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":222.04,"image":{"id":727704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her husband Roy, who is 41 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 7 and 13 years old. Renilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Renilda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 so that she will have enough revolving capital to buy more ingredients and be able to offer a wider variety of food in her carinderia (small restaurant) and she also intends to use part of the loan to sustain her fishing activities. Renilda is working hard so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her businesses. Renilda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

Sher colony, which is located in Sahiwal, an area known for its agriculture industry. She married five years ago, and she and her husband have three small children who are still too young to attend school. The family lives in a two-room brick house. Nazia has great administrative skills and manages her household expenses effectively.\r\n \r\nHer husband is a fruit vendor who sells fruit at the market. He supplements his income as a daily-wage laborer, taking on jobs whenever they are available. Nazia has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to improve her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, he will buy fresh seasonal fruits to offer for sale, which will increase his income and sales. \r\n\r\nNazia is hopeful that her husband\u2019s business will grow further through the investment of this loan.

With the loan, she will buy materials such as beads, wires and glue for making jewelry in bulk quantity. This will help her offer more variety to her clients and make more profits. Goghi started her business 12 years ago and it is working very well for her. She won't leave this work and her marriage as well. She offers her jewelry at cheaper rates \u2013 that\u2019s why she has a good number of clients. \r\n\r\nGoghi is hopeful that a loan investment will help her make larger profits and she will be able to start saving some money every month for her son\u2019s education.

A. is a widow and a homemaker with many household duties.

Nadezhda has finished school with high marks and dreamed of studying further, but her mother was unable give to her daughter a higher education. Nadezhda finished beauty school and found work with an established hairstylist.  She helped her mother raise her younger sister and brother.  A year later, she met her husband and became the mother of two daughters. Unfortunately, the marriage did not work out, and after five years, Nadezhda became the sole support for her family. To support her children, she started to bake pies and to distribute them in the village of Kemin, supplying them to shops and kiosks which has allowed her to create a loyal customer base.  Also, Nadezhda continued working as a beautician.   On her small verandah, she does hair and manicures for her neighbors.  A bit more than a year ago, while coming home from distributing pies, Nadezhda found an abandoned newborn baby near her house. After considering it and consulting her daughters, they decided not to give the baby to an orphanage, but instead to adopt her.  Now Nadezhda\u2019s small daughter gives faith, pleasure and happiness to the entire family.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since 1991 Nadezhda and her older daughters have raised pigs. In September 2009, Nadezhda applied for her first loan from Bai Tushum and received 70,000 KGS. The money helped Nadezhda increase her livestock and to maintain their living areas.  Keeping pigs has provided an income, but the growing requirements of the children mean she must expand the business and become more profitable. So Nadezhda has decided take out a second loan to expand her farm.  Nadezhda plans to take out the second loan for 120,000 KGS to buy more pigs.  Nadezhda is a goal-oriented, persistent person who is doing everything she can to get her children on their feet and give them a good education.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

F. owns a facility in the central city market selling fabrics for sewing national women dresses. She has been in this trade for 15 years. \r\n\r\nHer turnover capital has doubled since she started her small business. She is married with four children. She lives in Penjikent, Tajikistan. \r\n\r\nBakhtiniso has a perfect credit history in IMON International. She has repaid all her loans without any delinquencies. Bakhtiniso believes a loan of 10,000 TJS will help her increase her working capital and profits. She wants to purchase more variety of fabrics and expand her marketing area. \r\n\r\nBakhtiniso has become an entrepreneur through hard work and dedication and she believes this will help her succeed in the future. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M. is married and has 4 children. Together with her husband, she sells women's clothing in the central market. Mashhura has been in this business for 10 years. Mashhura's business is constantly growing. Two of the advantages she has in the competitive market are affordable prices and regular additions to her inventory. Her little vending kiosks are very popular in the marketplace where she works. Mashhura realizes that lending services are very helpful to her business, as loans allow her to increase her turnover capital and expand her business. She would like to make it easier for women to find comfortable and good quality clothing, which is why she is requesting a loan of 9,500 Somoni. One of Mashhura's further plans is to continue expanding her trade and eventually generate enough profit to finish remodeling her house and improve her family's living standards. \n  \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

O. is 49 years old, married, and has four children. He sells dried fruits in the central local market. He has been in this business for 12 years. The dried fruits are very popular in Tajikistan. They are served to guests and during family occasions such as wedding parties and birthday parties. Considering the constant demand for this type of goods, Jalil's business is quite successful and results in a stable income for his family. Jalil wants to increase the stock of his goods in order to be able to supply all the demands of his buyers. He is requesting a loan 6,000 Somoni, which he will use to  purchase dried fruits, such as raisins and apricots, and nuts, such as almonds and pistachios, with the purpose of increasing the range of goods he sells. Jalil has a positive credit history. He would like to thank all for support and promises to pay the loan in time.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The more he is able to work the more money he can make. \r\n\r\nShuhrat has requested a loan of 5000 Somoni so that he can have some welding work done on the engine of his car.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
