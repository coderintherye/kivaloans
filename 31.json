She works seven days a week checking customers in, overseeing improvement projects, and managing the hotel's 2 employees.

Next door, also on the busy Avenida de Tres Mascaras, their daughter owns a shop specializing in gum, sweets, and beverages.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria is quite proud of her hotel, which contains 24 rooms. It is an upscale lodging, with hot water and private bathrooms. She says most of her clients are business people from all over Peru, along with visiting foreigners. Maria has many goals for the improvement of her hotel, which she says is an ongoing project.

His wife works at home looking after their children and also selling different food products from a room that Nazirjon made into a shop.\r\n\r\nEvery day, Nazirjon goes to bazaars in different kishlaks to trade. Afterwards, he comes home, rests, and cuts his neighbors' hair. All of this work forms his family income. He spent his first loan to expand the assortment of perfumery and small goods. As his business has grown and is comparatively big, he needs money for its expansion. He has applied for a loan to increase his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":51793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Elizabeth E., 32, is married to Raul Osorio. They have an 8-year old daughter who is studying in third grade. Raul works in a supermarket and Cinthya started a despensa, a small convenience store, to increase family income. She sell  mostly basic products such as flour, rice, eggs, and bread. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore Cynthia had her daughter, she used to work as a sales person and as a maid. However, after the birth of her daughter, she started her despensa at her house in order to stay at home and care for her child at the same time. Together with her husband, they took their first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya to buy a freezer and increase their stock of merchandise. During the past year, their business has grown and opened up many more opportunities.

He started working in the biggest market in Ecuador named Bahia. His boss at a previous business sent him to rural towns to sell his products. When Victor and his wife decided they would go into business together, they based their business model on Victor\u2019s previous job. They had success early on because they knew exactly which towns were the most lucrative markets, and they offered promotions to the best buyers, whom they knew personally.<\/p>\r\n<p>Each day they work from 5am until 10pm.

Victor\u2019s wife is a great salesperson, and she typically sells in the small towns and at the local festivals which occur fairly often.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>They have two grown children who help sell their goods, and the family unit has maintained a strong foundation over the years. Their house is their greatest collateral. Victor will used his second loan to continue to increase the volume of shoes and clothing in stock to sell when the Riveras go to market. He is a 48 year-old with four children, who also contribute to the family business. His wife is his right hand, and he could not do anything without her. She is responsible for the finances, taking care of the house, and looking after the children. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many years ago they lived in Victor\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s home, but they saved enough money to move out on their own. Their new home was made of cane and they slept on the floor. Now, after working hard, they enjoy a house that is made of concrete, and each child has a room of his own. The Riveras are proud to have gotten out of their previous situation, which was dire poverty. Although they are still poor, they enjoy an average standard of living for the people in their sector.

Description<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Mrs. Florencia has dedicated herself to the sale of home products such as: pans, sheets, clothing, etc. She also sells candy to public buses' passengers. She began to work because the number members in her family grew and her husband's income alone was not enough to support them. With a small amount of cash given by her husband she started to buy and sell candies. She, then, invested the profit in the purchase of clothing and other goods and, after that, slowly her business started to grow. She works from Mondays through Saturdays, from 7:30am to 6:00pm.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Investment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Mrs. Florencia wishes to receive this credit because she does not have enough money to purchase merchandise.

Her best sellers are basic products such as a bread, milk, eggs, and oil. <p>\r\n \r\nThe store used to belong to her mother, but as her mother started to retire 15 years ago little by little, Mariangela began to take responsibility for the business. She used her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya to buy a pick-up truck to transport merchandise more economically instead of traveling by taxi. Since then, the store has grown a lot. For example, today they offer a variety of products that they were not able to offer before they received their loan. Now, her store is self-sustaining. She is asking for a loan in order to buy a used car that her husband can remodel and fix up for resale. They hope this side business will increase their family income in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":51974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase used car to fix and resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Villa Elisa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.366667 -57.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2007-08-03T20:07:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariangela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-19T20:10:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":71.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T01:32:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T20:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51386,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T19:33:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T20:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":64009,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2007-11-06T23:08:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T20:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":77506,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2007-12-07T00:41:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T20:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":92669,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":712,"local_amount":712,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T20:35:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-02T20:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":712,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106792,"comment":"Prepayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-08-05T20:10:32Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T20:35:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":15294,"name":"Magdalena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magdalena is a 34 year old, single mother living and working in Juliaca.

After graduation, she began to work as a school teacher. Gradually, Dilrabo climbed the career ladder and now she works as the school\u2019s principle. The school is located in a small village of Shurab. Dilrabo loves her work and enjoys teaching. However, a schoolteacher\u2019s pay is not enough to sustain oneself, and Dilrabo must do something in addition to her work in school. To earn extra income, Dilrabo and her entire family breed cattle. When Dilrabo learned of MicroInvest, she came for an appointment and liked the loan conditions. Dilrabo took a loan and bought several rams. According to Dilrabo, the purchase brought additional income into her family\u2019s budget. Now, she asks for a new loan to purchase more rams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":52024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To expand the

She is 41, married, and has 3 children. Her husband is very old (he is 85) and unable to work. Muhtassar married him, when she was 27. Since then, all the weight of providing for the family fell on her shoulders. In her region, it is impossible to find a stable job with a decent income, so Muhtassar\u2019s only solution was to sell on a market. The assortment of her goods consists of socks, scarves, and other small items. There is a high demand for Muhtassar\u2019s goods and she has earned many permanent customers. In the beginning, her entire business could fit on a small counter. Gradually, the volume grew, and now Muhtassar sells significantly more goods. Eventually, Muhtassar was able to open another retail spot, which is now run by her oldest daughter. Muhtassar has been a client of MicroInvest for 1.5 years. The loans that she received helped Muhtassar to grow her business. Now she asks for a loan to buy a collection of summer items."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":52026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase summer seasonal items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2007-08-15T06:05:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhtassar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-31T14:12:04Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-09-20T09:19:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-20T09:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":56778,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-10-20T09:22:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-20T09:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69926,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-11-20T10:24:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-20T09:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":84163,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-12-20T10:26:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-20T09:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99979,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-01-20T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-20T09:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118766,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-20T09:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138922,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-03-20T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-20T09:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":161963,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-04-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-20T09:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":187114,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-05-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-20T09:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":215051,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-06-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-20T09:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":243832,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-08-17T14:12:04Z","paid_date":"2008-06-20T09:05:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":15306,"name":"Minneh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M. is married, mother of four children who are in school.

Now, she can proudly say that she has a fixed and stable clientele which helps her sales. Her relationship with most of her clientele is a long-lasting one.\r\nPreviously, Margarita owned a food stand, but she left it for her present job to be able to work less and spend more time with crafts, one of her hobbies.  \r\nCurrently, she exports some of her clothing products to Buenos Aires where Paraguayan cloth is in high demand. Also her professionalism and refined work help her get customers.    \r\nMargarita now has to work overtime and close at later hours, since her mom is sick and has been hospitalized.

purchases and sells dried fruits in the markets of Isfara.

Sometimes she purchases dried apricots of low quality and then brings them home, sorts them by quality level and takes them out to sell.  Her children help her with this.  Ashurhon has been a MicroInvest client for 1.5 years.  During this time her business has expanded noticeably and she has purchased a color television and DVD player for her home.

is a young man who never feels down and always looks to the future.  When he was little and in school he took his father\u2019s bulls and cows out to pasture.  Huge bulls and cows listened to the little boy.  While the herd grazed Abdumubin did his homework and read books.  In the evening he brought the herd home.  That is why he developed a love of animals from childhood.  According to his father, since childhood Abdumubin wanted to build a farm that fed livestock.  He is also a butcher. <p>\r\n\r\nToday, Abdumubin has his own family \u2013 a wife and 3 children.  The youngest is not yet one.  Abdumubin lives with his family in his parents\u2019 home, since he is the youngest child in the family.  The dream of his childhood \u2013 the feeding of livestock has become his sole source of income.  Sometimes he earns extra income by working as a taxi driver using his old car.  During this time his wife and father look after the livestock at home.  To expand his livestock Abdumubin turned to MLF MicroInvest and after getting a loan of $950 purchased four small bulls.  The loan assisted him in earning extra profits.  Abdumubin keeps all records of the business \u2013 revenues, cost and profits \u2013 in a special notebook.  Profits from feeding livestock are good right now, because upkeep is cheaper in the summer.  Abdumubin will use the new loan to continue his business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina H., Kiva

Later, with the profits, they were able to build a small booth and nowadays they have a well equipped restaurant where more than 20 persons come to eat every day.\r\n<p>Ramona tells us proudly that everything they have achieved, they have done honestly. She wants to continue expanding her business, and therefore she is requesting a loan to buy merchandise to sell, like soft drinks, juices, candies, and beer, as this is what is most in demand by her customers.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated by Ram\u00f3n F.

She does not have any extra savings but has to save money to pay her electric, light, water, and telephone bills. She has a truck that belonged to her husband that she wants to sell but cannot sell it because she has no one to sell it to.<p>Marciana is a member and president of a group called Mujeres Emprendedores. There are 20 women in her group, where members proviD. collateral through a group repayment pledge and the incentive to repay is based on peer pressure; if one person in the group defaults, the other group members will be responsible for making up the payment amount. In addition, their group also has a separate savings box where each member contributes about $.20 each week. Together their group also fundraises, for example it provided food for the festival for San Juan.<p>Marciana is very grateful for being able to be part of a group that is respectful and honest.

C., 44, is mother of 9 children. With the help of her children, she works at home and constructs all types of baskets made from bamboo. She has been working on this for more then 6 years now. Pabla started at a young age learning to weave baskets. All of her children help her everyday in her business. Usually, each person can make about 10 baskets per day, thus, on average she can produce about 30 per day. The length of time to complete each product depends on its size. Usually it is quicker to construct bigger baskets, such as a laundry basket, rather than a smaller basket that is more detail-oriented. <p>\r\nBesides selling in the city of It\u00e1, Pabla also travels to other cities on the weekends to sell her products. She travels by bus to San Lorenzo, Luque, and Olimpia; all of which is about an hour and half bus ride from her home.

She travels to Karosuu, Kyrgyzstan and Kokand, Uzebkistan to purchase goods. It is very difficult for Inobat to travel to different countries to buy goods because there are problems with transportation and customs inspectors on the borders between countries.

specializes in the trade of milk products. Five years ago, she took responsibility for her family because her husband was sent to jail. In order to be able to take care of her four young sons and the constant problems with her flat, G. was forced to start selling at the nearby market. G. is originally from Uzbekistan and could have moved her family there but her husband is imprisoned in Tajikistan, so she decided to stay. <\/br>\r\nHer day starts at 4 in the morning when she starts going through the villages buying milk products. She spends the rest of the day selling them at the central market in Isfara. Her sons have learned how to bake bread, cook food, do laundry and run other household errands in order to help their mother. Since childhood, one of her sons has been shortsighted. In January 2007 G. received a loan through \u201cMicroInvenst\u201d for her son\u2019s surgery. After paying back her first loan, she received a loan to expand her business \u2013 the sale of milk products. Currently she is planning to receive another loan to expand her business, which is the only source of income for G. and her family. \r\n<p><b> Translated from Russian by Keith & Jamilya Leitich, Kiva

has been in business for several years. Her husband helps her.  T. is 41 and has four children. She started her business by selling children\u2019s clothing. Slowly she changed to selling fabrics, since as she says herself, it is more profitable. She travels to wholesale markets 100-170 km from her home to purchase fabrics.  She does not have a permanent stall, so she travels to different markets. She moves her goods in her own car. T. has been collaborating with \u201cMicroInvest\u201d for 6 months. Her previous loans were used to expand her business and increase the number and variety of different fabrics. Currently, it is peak sales season for T. as there are a lot of weddings which by traditions require that new dresses be made. The season of warm fabrics is coming soon, and T. wants to get a loan to purchase these fabrics. \r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Russian by Keith & Jamilya Leitich, Kiva Volunteers.
