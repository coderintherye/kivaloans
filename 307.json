She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week. Eva currently earns about 90 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase crops in bulk for her business.

Eva thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T07:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757668,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146762,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984907,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015580,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740586,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":71824.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773700,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T12:03:37Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":153334,"name":"Nelly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Nelly es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cJuchuy Ni\u00f1o\u201d ubicado en el distrito de Capachica, Provincia de Puno, Departamento de Puno; tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad, de estado civil casada y tiene 2 hijos, vive en Ccotos, estudi\u00f3 educaci\u00f3n secundaria completa.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora esta trabajando con el Movimiento Manuela Ramos desde hace 1 a\u00f1o, su pr\u00e9stamo inicial de S\/. 300.00 Nuevos Soles, el cual le permiti\u00f3 incrementar su capital para su negocio de venta de pescado.\n\nEn la actualidad requiere de un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo de S\/. 500.00 Nuevos soles, el cual le permitir\u00e1 comprar redes nuevas para mejorar su negocio de la pesca artesanal que lo realiza 2 veces por semana.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To purchase medicines in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T13:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Helena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757672,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146766,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984911,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015584,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740590,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":71824.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773704,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T15:16:46Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":153346,"name":"Leonza Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leonza Maria es casada, tiene 2 ni\u00f1os: 1 de 9 a\u00f1os estudiando la primaria y una bebita de 6 meses de edad, trabaja en el sistema penitenciario de Juigalpa como sub-alguacil reeducadora desde hace 6 a\u00f1os, esta solicitando su 7mo refinanciamiento para mejora de vivienda, actualmente habita en casa de sus suegros, y desea darle condiciones al lugarcito que tiene, pues no tiene piso y quiere poner la ceramica en la salita y construir un cuarto para asi brindar mejores condiciones a sus hijos y mas a la peque\u00f1ita que esta inquieta por aprender a dar sus primeros pasitos.

This is 37 years old Selina L. from Mbozi. She is married   with 2  children, between the ages of 8  and 12. Selina has been running a fish  business since 2004. She owns and operates a small stall from which she sells roasted fish. She buys fresh fish daily from local fishermen as they come in with their morning catch, and then roasts and sells these fish either in the fish market on along the roads of the city. Given its location along the water, fish is plentiful in the waters around the city and is a staple of the local Tanzanian diet.  She is an enterprising micro-entrepreneur who is taking advantage of a local need to make monthly profits of $90.\n\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week.  She is requesting a loan in order to purchase fish in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to improve quality and range of product. Selina thanks you for your support!\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase fish in bulk for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T14:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Selina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757676,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146770,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984915,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015588,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740594,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":71824.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773708,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-25T00:22:47Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":153362,"name":"Daniel Alfonso","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el sr.

Sophia thanks you for your support!\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

is an established businesswoman who has been running her jewelry business for over five years. She says that December always brings her more customers, so she needs to stock up on inventory to meet her customers' needs. She likes working for herself because it allows her more flexibility to spend time with her family and be able to pick her nine-year-old daughter up from school. For Amalia, the most important thing is having enough time for her family. She sends remittances to her father back in Mexico every month.\r\n\r\nSometimes Amalia is challenged because she sells her larger items to customers on credit or in installments. As she explains in her video, sometimes clients do not pay on time or at all, but this happens very rarely and Amalia believes it's important for customer service to trust the customer. She is also planning to enroll in computer classes at her local library so that she can learn to use software to organize her bookkeeping. \r\n\r\nAmalia found out about ACCION USA through a course that she took on starting a small business. She has been very happy with her experience. She has borrowed five loans from ACCION USA and repaid them all

has been in the taxi business for fifteen years. After renting for many years, he decided to purchase a taxi.  \r\n\r\nWhen he bought his taxi, Rafael found no options for financing other than a high-interest loan from an informal moneylender, also known as a \"prestamista\" or \"loan shark.\" Because these loans have a very high interest rate -- between 60-120% APR (sometimes charged weekly) -- many borrowers, like Rafael, cannot stay current with payments. Rafael was paying several hundred dollars a week just in interest. He is currently asking for an ACCION USA loan to help pay off this predatory debt for his taxicab and begin to improve his livelihood. \r\n\r\nHe has a very long-standing relationship with his taxi company and, in the future, he hopes to have a taxi corporation of his own with 20-30 drivers! In this video, he talks about how he started out as a \"taxista\" and how he purchased his

She began with her own savings as an itinerant saleswoman of atole (drink made of cornflour) and sweets in the capital's urban routes.  It was difficult work but she had to generate income because her husband's earnings weren't sufficient to provide schooling, clothing and food for four children.  Thanks to God, she would sell out of everything.  In time, she was able to start to sell sweets from her home and little by little it grew into a small general store which, thanks to loans from Afodenic, she was able to strenghthen still more until today.  Her four children are students and her husband is a driver.  Her plan is to be able to continue to make improvements to her home.  With this loan she will stock up on rice, beans, sugar, oil, soap, sweets, dairy products, among other items, which are typical of Nicaraguan cuisine.  She hopes to improve sales since they have been low these past few months which has led to net losses rather than profits.  What has helped her to stay afloat is that she rents two rooms which produce a fixed monthly income with which she can pay basic utilities, among other expenses.

She has a small grocery store in her home and has sold basic grains, fruits, and vegetables there for the past eight years.  She started her business with small loans and has continued to invest in her store in order to sell more products.  She cannot sell meats because she doesn\u2019t have a refrigerator in which to keep them; she only has a small cooler that Pepsi gave her, which allows her to sell soft drinks and other small products.  Her house is small, the walls are not made of concrete, and she doesn\u2019t have privacy, and because she doesn\u2019t have additional space for storing her products she has to put them in the living room.  Zaida has two children, both of whom go to school in the neighborhood and help her in the afternoon, since their mother is a very hardworking woman who, as a single mother, attends to all of their needs.

R., 38, makes and sells tortillas.  She has done this for several years and it is a profitable business because tortillas are consumed with every meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner).  Vilma's tortillas are good and delicious.  She sells them in little markets, small grocery stores and also distributes them among various neighborhoods and homesteads near her home.  She needs financing to buy more wheat flour, firewood, lime powder, water and matches to increase her tortilla production.

She has two jobs:  she works as a caretaker for a private company until the afternoon.  When she gets home she prepares fried food and sells quite a bit of soy chicharrones (pork cracklings); she sends her children out to sell around the neighborhood.  She sells them for 5 C\u00f3rdoba a bag.  Sales are brisk thanks to their good flavor and to improve daily nutrition.  She started this small business with money from her salary and now, with financing from Afodenic, she has managed to increase her meal sales:  she can buy larger quantities of meat and vegetables to produce more to sell and thereby earn better profits.  With this loan she will buy zinc metal sheeting and structural metal bars to replace her house's roof which is very old and leaky during Winter rains.  For this reason she needs to make improvements but this would only be possible with financing since her salary and profits from her sales barely suffice to meet basic household needs.

His business is a carpenter shop, in which he has made different types of furniture for 32 years.  The most difficult part is that sometimes it is hard to obtain quality wood, and when he is able, he can only afford to buy a small amount to finish the job he is on, due to the high price.  He is 49 years old, and his goal is to be able to support his children in their studies.  When he began doing carpentry, he made the furniture by himself, but now he has two workers who help him finish the furniture more quickly and with a higher quality.  Over time he has built up a good clientele that recommends him to others, and he is the only one in the sector of the neighborhood Laureles Sur with this business, which is a great advantage.

As examples we have Mrs. Benedicta S. who makes and sells variously flavored yoghurts according to her customers' wishes; she also sells various fruit nectars.  She has a lot of demand so the funds she receives will be used to buy an ice chest.  This has allowed her to support her son in his empolyment agency.  She is a very active group member and, because of that, she was selected to be the group president.  As group treasurer, Elsa D\u00e1valos is concerned that the group makes punctual repayments.

I. is a 59-year-old woman living in the town of Laulii Maagila.  She is married and has 5 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Nuufou owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector selling home products.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling personal home products to tourists and local community members.  \n\nIn 2009, Nuufou joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nuufou is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase raw materials needed to make products for sale.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Nuufou plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":428021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

She and her husband built it 30 years ago.\r\n\r\nShe started this business selling on the street with a small counter and a table grill.  After a while, the municipality did not permit this type of selling on the street.  So, she had to rent a place.  This was favorable for her because she had many customers, and she needed space to take care of them more comfortably.  There were only a few tables and chairs that she could get.  With great effort she was able to buy fixtures, a much larger charcoal grill, and some shelves that she needed.\r\n\r\nCelestina gets up very early to buy the supplies she needs because the quality of her food is very important to her.  She knows that she has a lot of competition.  That is why she herself prepares the food and supervises waiting on the customers.  Also, she has always had help from her four children.  Thanks to working as a team, three of them are professionals.  She is very happy that through this business she could help her siblings.  They are now merchants in different fields.  She helps her parents with their basic necessities as well as contributing at home.  She has a niece who works with her.  That way she can help her economically.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy supplies and renovate some of the counters that she has in her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":428029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"Buy supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-11-30T16:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.25,"local_amount":163.58,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":164.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669106,"comment":null},{"amount":82.75,"local_amount":236.42,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:33Z","rounded_local_amount":237.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064568,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899628,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933711,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661321,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:23Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694016,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877008,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617006,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831385,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:59Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172097993,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-01T03:06:39Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":153507,"name":"Claudia Carolina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Claudia is 30 years old and has two children, ages 7 and 9.

J. is from the city of Hinagdong Ozamiz City. She is 30 years old and single. To make a living, Gina owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling products such as junk food, sugar, candies, salt, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Gina has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Gina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Gina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Gina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":425780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her husband is Mr. Artemio A. and they happily live in a village located at Buliwao, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya. All of their children are studying in the secondary and elementary levels of education. Because of their interest to give their children a better future, they are striving hard to support their schooling.\r\n\r\nThey cultivate their farm lot twice a year by planting vegetables and root crops. Aside from this, Maribel also buys and sells vegetables to help her husband in gaining  more income.

V. is from the village of Usocan.

Her business is by the roadside and she provides assistance to those whose vehicles break down while driving, as well as typical repair to anyone who brings their equipment to her. Susette has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2007, Susette joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and used as working capital.\n\nSusette is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her 4th from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

V. is a 39-year-old woman living in the town of Seesee. She is married and has five school-aged children.\r\n\r\nLemalie owns and operates a business making and selling food, selling dried goods in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 400 WST a month.\r\n\r\nLemalie joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,000 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nLemalie is now requesting a new loan of 1,750 WST which will again be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be her 4th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling lake-caught fish in the local community.  H. has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2003, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

She is now requesting a new L. of 7,194,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. The L. will be the eighth L. taken out by the borrower from SEDA. H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Nenita lives in Prk Masinadyahon and is married to a pensioner, Victor C.. They have six children who are grown and have their own families, with a total of 19 grandchildren. In spite of her age, she continues her business because this is the bread and butter of her family.  \r\n\r\nHer husband used to work as a carpenter in a milling company with an income that was not enough to compensate for household expenses. She engaged herself in different types of businesses like fish vending, farm work, selling of native delicacies from other barangays and would do laundry for their neighbor to help her husband with expenses. At the wee hours of the morning, Nenita would start her daily routine of taking care of her children while preparing for her businesses. In 1999, she became a member of NWTF-PD and her loan was used for her general store which was adjacent to her house. She also sold different viands to her husband's company. With this additional income for her family, she was able to send her children to school. Luckily, her business did well and she was able to earn PHP 9,000 that month, which was used for savings and to defray some family expenses.\r\n\r\nNenita continues to loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 was used as an additional capital for her general store.  She paid for this particular loan on time without any delay. Borrowing the same amount of PHP 15,000, she will be buying additional working inventory for her general store and the income from it will be used for family improvements and other investments.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

F. is a 33-year-old woman living in the town of Gagaifo Lefaga. She is married and has one infant child.\n\nFoisaga owns and operates a business planting and harvesting taro for sale. She has been engaged in this business for years and earns approximately 1,500 WST a month from these activities.\n\nFoisaga joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Foisaga has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,700 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.\n\nFoisaga is now requesting a new loan of 2,400 WST which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. The loan will be her 4th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\n\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":428170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Cambodia Sewing Cooperative Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Five single women in their early 20's recently formed a new sewing cooperative called Circle Cambodia, creating a new chapter in life and a fresh start. These women work together and live together in Phnom Penh, and their bond of friendship runs deep,  as they have overcome incredibe adversity together. \n\nAll of these women come from difficult family backgrounds, namely large single parent families. One of the women was orphaned at an early age and another suffered from abuse. With the assistance of a counter-human trafficking NGO, the women left their families in the rural provinces and moved to Phnom Penh to attend vocational training school. This NGO provides alternative livelihood options for children deemed to be at high risk of trafficking due to vulnerable family situations. Once sewing school was complete, the five women of Circle Cambodia found employment with a woman who ran a small tailor shop out of her home. This woman did provide housing, but unfortunately she made some poor financial decisions and became heavily indebted, and within a short time she started withholding salaries from her employees, using the money to pay down her own debt instead. Without having another place to live, the women of Circle Cambodia were trapped in an exploitative working and living situation. One year later a tailor shop customer found out about the injustice of the working conditions, and she facilitated a way out for the women, provided them with a new place to live and a promise of future business once the women were able to buy their own sewing machines.  \n\nPhany, one of the youngest women in the group, has the most sewing experience. She has been sewing since 2003 and is an accomplished seamstress. She excels at cutting patterns - a skill she is teaching the other group members who started sewing in 2007.  Phany's cheerful personality, friendly demeanor and quite confidence seems to be a unifying force in the group. Phany grew up in Kompong Cham province of Cambodia. Her father died when she was young, which resulted in great financial hardship for the family as Phany's mother tried to support her 10 children. Prior to coming to Phnom Penh, Phany was working in the fields, picking beans, for a wage of $0.75 a day. Phany enjoys sewing, and her outlook on the future of Circle Cambodia is bright. \n\nEach member of the Circle Cambodia co-operative requested a loan of $145 to be used for the purchase of a sewing machine. The disbursal meeting was filled with excitement, and the women already had plans for an afternoon trip to the market to shop for machines. Circle Cambodia has secured initial orders and they look forward to expanding their business to include Cambodian customers and possibly even foreign customers through an online global marketplace. The women take English lessons for one hour each day, and the women are teaching an illiterate member of the group how to read in the Khmer language. The Circle Cambodia co-operative  dreams that one day their business will be successful enough for them to start training new employees who come from similar vulnerable backgrounds. \n\nAbout SIGU:\nThis loan is the first made by AMK's Special Interest Group Unit (SIGU). As part of the Product Development department, SIGU was developed as an initiative to further reflect AMK\u2019s mission, and to serve more \u2018vulnerable\u2019 groups that are currently underserved by microfinance services. These groups include women who are victims of trafficking, domestic violence and other gender-based traumas, people living with HIV\/AIDS, street people and children and people with disabilities. AMK is currently focusing on assisting women who are victims of trafficking, domestic violence and other gender-based traumas. Current SIGU projects include developing microfinance specific financial literacy training and creating a pilot credit program specific to this population. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":428221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"buy sewing machines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2009-11-20T06:47:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phany","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phally","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thavy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":725,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110626741,"comment":null},{"amount":180,"local_amount":180,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123862157,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T07:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137012101,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151839402,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159579916,"comment":null},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166790196,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172059579,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177350707,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":65,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188620345,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-20T10:18:01Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:08:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":153590,"name":"Jomelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jomelyn L. is also called as \u201cMelyn\u201d in their village.

She is married to Ric B. and they are blessed with two children. They help each other to earn a living for their survival and for the future of their children.\r\n\r\nMary Anne's husband is a carpenter in Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, while she helps her husband in gaining income by selling MSE and Natasha cosmetics products in their village. She wants to acquire more of these products so she can sell more to their village but she cannot afford to due to lack of capital. Having the interest to continue her business, she wants to borrow additional capital from Kiva lenders amounting to 5,000 Philippine pesos to acquire more of these products. She is so happy with this financial assistance that gives her the opportunity to continue and improve her small business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":428136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional capital for selling costmetics ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Buliwao,Quezon,Nueva Vizcaya","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2009-11-19T03:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Anne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":208.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.2},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.2},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.2},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.2},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":5.21,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:00:21Z","rounded_local_amount":242.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103727134,"comment":null},{"amount":5.21,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":242.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103727135,"comment":null},{"amount":5.2,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":242.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103727136,"comment":null},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":4375.01,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5088.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110614732,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-19T06:43:37Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T11:23:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":153598,"name":"Benedicto's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benedicto M. is a 62-year-old, hardworking man.

Deborah takes care of additional family members.The family has access to electricity and piped water and gets three meals a day. <p>\r\n\r\nShe works in a semi-urban area which is in the outskirts of Kampala. She uses public transport to and from shopping. Deborah works seven days a week and receives an average of 25 customers a day. She sells to all categories of people but at retail only. Her major business challenges include the ever-increasing prices of second-hand clothes and the rainy season which hinders her customers from reaching her because she works in an open place. Her monthly expenses include school fees, feeding the family and medication.  She has been in this business for ten years and with MCDT for ten years, servicing her twentieth loan. Deborah joined MCDT because it was near her home and it was easy to work with it. She wants to use this loan to buy more bales of second-hand clothes. She is aspiring to see her business grow bigger and start selling at wholesale

He is 29 years old, single, and father of one child who is 7 years old.  He completed 12th grade and is currently enrolled in technical college.  He lives in his own home with his siblings and also supports his daughter who lives with her mother.  \r\n\r\nHe left Chimoio for Maputo, specifically for the Boane district, with his parents when he was 14 years old.  He has his own business selling basic necessities and cell phone minutes.  He earns around 11.000,00 MT from these activities and also earns 4.900,00 MT a subsidy paid by the Rwandan embassy, where he teaches a Portuguese language class form 5pm to 7pm.  With his earnings he is able to save some money in his bank account. \r\n\r\nHe has never had loans in other banking institutions.  He learned about Hluvuku through his brother who is also a client of the institution.  This is his 4th loan, in the amount of 21.000,00 MT, which he will use to purchase products (biscuits, sugar, soups, batteries, etc.) to serve his customers.  His prior loans were for the same amount and for the same activities.\r\n\r\nIn the future he plans to request additional loans with the goal of growing his business and building a shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

She lives with her children in her parents\u2019 home, and she financially maintains 3 siblings who live with them.  She left Matola for Boane when she was a child.  She has had her own business for 3 years, she works alone from 11 until 2, but sometimes her sister helps her. She earns about 2.000.00mt to 3.000.00mt a day through this business and she saves her money in a traditional savings system called (Xitique).  She learned to save money this way from her mother, who has been involved in the system for 20 years.  She has never had loans with other banks, and she learned about Hluvuku through friends that are clients of this institution.  This is her first loan and has a value of 15.000.00mt, which she will use to buy construction materials (cement, steel, sand and other materials) in order to begin her work.  She is committed to paying this loan in order to be able to access loans in the future.  In the future she would like to continue her education and take out more loans in order to finish her project.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":510.87,"image":{"id":428269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-11-17T14:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":14.13,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":681.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":709.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":738.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":768.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":800.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.27},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":867.52},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":903.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":940.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":978.93},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1019.16},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1061.04},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1104.64},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1150.04},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1197.3},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1246.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.85},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.82},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.85},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.9},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.02},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.36},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.26},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.9},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":48.42,"local_amount":1383.56,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1404.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709059,"comment":null},{"amount":0.25,"local_amount":7.02,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-18T10:03:02Z","rounded_local_amount":7.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118101621,"comment":null},{"amount":44.28,"local_amount":1265.18,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938166,"comment":null},{"amount":52.82,"local_amount":1509.24,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1531.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938167,"comment":null},{"amount":53.81,"local_amount":1555.11,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-17T07:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1578.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.62,"payment_id":128972047,"comment":null},{"amount":55.32,"local_amount":1580.5,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1604.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698631,"comment":null},{"amount":60.03,"local_amount":1715.23,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1740.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916075,"comment":null},{"amount":195.94,"local_amount":5984.16,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6073.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":13.51,"payment_id":159878503,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-17T17:06:29Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":153621,"name":"Rosalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Rosalie has two children with her husband Marlou.

He is 38 years old, married and the father of 3 children, who are 8, 5, and 3 years old.  His oldest child attends school.  Armando went to school up until his 3rd year of the Industrial Institute, but stopped his studies because he had to work in order to support his family.  He lives in his own home and is not financially responsible for anyone except his immediate family.  He left Chimoio for Boane in 1999 when he was transferred with the [military] service.  A short time after that he built his own home where he still lives with his family. He is an employee of Mozambique Electricity company where he works as an electrician.  He has worked there for 8 years, for 8 hours a day from Monday through Friday.  He learned how to do this work in Chimoio in 1998.  His monthly salary is 7.465,00mt and he is able to save a little each month.  He has never had a loan with any other financial institution and this is his first loan with Hluvuku, for 15.000,00mt.  He will use the money to buy sand, cement, steel, rocks and other building materials to finish his project.  He heard about Hluvuku because he lives next to the Boane branch.  He is committed to paying his loan off on-time in order to qualify for other loans to furnish his home and to open a business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

Letecia has been engaged in her business for over nine years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Letecia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Letecia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. Letecia is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Letecia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 28, single, and the mother of a 4-year-old son.  She studied through 12th grade at the Joaquim Chissano high school in Boane.  She lives in her own home in Boane with her brother.  She doesn't support anyone else besides her son.  She left Maputo for Boane in 2002 with her parents because they lived in a rented home.  She has been employed with a humanitarian organization (Kulima) for more than 2 years.  She works 8 hours a day on average.  She makes a wage of 4,300 meticais per month, and she manages to save some in a bank account through a rotating savings system called Xitique.  She has never had a loan with another banking institution.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through colleagues who are also clients of this institution.  This is her 3rd loan, and it is for 15,000 meticais, which she will use to buy construction material (stone, cement, sand, iron, etc.).  Her previous loans were for 5,000 and 10,000 meticais which she used for the same purpose.  In the future, she would like to request more loans to construct a new home, where she will spend her free time with her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

At this time, she is earning an average net income of not less than P15,000 from her business activity which is sufficient to support the family needs.\r\n\r\nAside from that, Obellie also earns an income from a newspaper publication called \u201cMisamis Weekly\u201d which has ten years of existence already in this city.

Myraflor is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Myraflor from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":428393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

N. is from the village of Zone 4, Tumpagon, Cagayan de Oro City. She is 28 years old. Jocelyn is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Jocelyn owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Jocelyn has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jocelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jocelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. Jocelyn is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Jocelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They live in the Bamanan district of Sako\u00efba (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  The women know one another through ties of kinship, marriage, and community, and they have revenue-generating businesses involving a variety of goods.  After five group loans, all repaid without difficulty, they are on their sixth solidarity loan.  This new loan will be used to buy 30 cart-loads of firewood, 27 sacks of charcoal, 3 sacks of peanuts, and a dozen plastic buckets in which to put peanut butter.\r\n\r\nSupplies of firewood and charcoal are gotten locally, furnished by producers from Zenguela, Soign\u00e9bougou, Ouassila, Siradoba, and Bougounina.  Supplies of peanuts are gotten at the big market of S\u00e9gou (at the weekly fairs).

A. is 28 years old, married and has a little daughter. His wife stays at home, but is currently training to be a hairdresser. She wants to open a salon so that she can supplement her husband\u2019s income. Dilshod sells hay for animals at his house and at the market. He buys them  wholesale from local farmers. Having worked in this business for 10 years already, he is a well-known seller of hay in his village and has many clients who buy hay from his house. The price he charges for hay is based on the quantity that his customer buys. Dilshod also offers a discount to his frequent buyers who come to him often. With a loan from IMON International, Dilshod plans to increase his stock in order to fully meet the demand of his growing customers. He says that the demand is there and his problem is being able to supply enough hay. The well being of this young family is in your hands.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, such as: Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Due to family problems, he couldn\u2019t continue in school, and so he got interested in revenue-generating work, notably buying and selling used motorbikes and replacement parts.  After fifteen years of apprenticeship with his elder brother, he has a good command of this business, which is very profitable for him and which brings in a fair amount of income.  He is very much in demand and receives many orders in a month.  \r\n\r\nTo satisfy his customers appropriately and to expand his business, Mr. Chaka turned toward the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now on his first individual loan.  This loan will serve to acquire a second-hand Djakarta motorbike and a few replacement parts to sell.  He supplies himself from motorbike wholesalers at the big market of Koutiala.  And he makes sales in cash or on credit to customers composed of women and men in Koutiala City.  \r\n\r\nWith a bigger business, he plans on realizing a profit of 100,000 francs CFA per month, which he will use to cover the loan interest and to care for his family, and he will invest the rest in his business.

The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Suraiyo is a 36-year-old mother whose husband has no fixed income. So, to cover day-to-day necessities, she processes and sells dried apricots with the help of her elder son. She uses all the money she makes to care for her three children and provide for their education. Suraiyo has 15 years of experience processing and selling dried apricots. She is very polite and considerate, and her clients are always very happy with the service they receive from her. Because her business is doing so well, she is increasing her net worth month by month. Today Suraiyo requests $1200 USD to purchase more dried apricots to process and increase her range of goods. Suraiyo and her son express their gratitude for everyone supporting them and they promise to repay their loan in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The savings from additional profits that are not reinvested in her business will allow her to take even better care of her child plus the two orphans she takes care of now.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":434896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase goods at better prices in greater quantities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Musanze\/Ruhengeli","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Floride","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":51475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110782247,"comment":null},{"amount":135.94,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:50:19Z","rounded_local_amount":77212.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169349,"comment":null},{"amount":45.31,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25737.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124008341,"comment":null},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":51475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129037570,"comment":null},{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":51475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136760239,"comment":null},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":51475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022674,"comment":null},{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":51475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152781752,"comment":null},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":51475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709631,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-01T22:08:00Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":153788,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce is 33 years old.
