The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional stocks of rice, cooking oil, and soda in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T14:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema E.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14887026,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:05:13Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436286,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130558,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027355,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613356,"comment":null},{"amount":70.85,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010436,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-10T19:17:48Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78663,"name":"Tutiniso","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"B.

This is 33-year-old Tusekile M. from Kyela. She is married with four children between the ages of 1 and 11. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphans.\r\n\r\nTusekile has been running a charcoal business since 2007. These small, black dirty pieces of dry earth are important not just to charcoal sellers but to their customers, who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. \r\n\r\nThe fire requires constant fanning to ignite and maintain the flame, and makes cooking quite a hot and laborious task. It may not be the easiest or most environmentally friendly form of cooking, but it is the only option many people can afford. She works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Tusekile currently earns about $190 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $325 in order to purchase more charcoal in bulk. In the future, she plans to open another store of charcoal for reselling. Tusekile thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Through their farming business, they were able to send their children to school and luckily gained college diplomas.  \r\n\r\nFrancisco is managing a one hectare field equally divided for their tobacco and rice farming. Every harvest, he is generating an estimated amount of PHP15,000 which is not enough to use as capital for the next planting season due to the increased cost of farm inputs.

Three of their children are already married.  Her family lives in the hilly and peaceful Barangay of San Isidro.  \r\n\r\nHerlosita is engaged in farm activities.  However, they lack financial resources to sustain their business so she is asking a loan of PHP10,000.  She intends to utilize the loan to buy their needed farm inputs like fertilizers, seedlings, insecticide and herbicide. Some of the amount will also be used to pay for labor works for those who will help them during the planting period. \r\n\r\nShe is proud that despite their old age, she and her husband are continuously helping and supporting each other in reaching their dreams.  They want their farming business to grow in order to generate higher income and provide for the educational needs of their youngest child who is now in high school. They hope that they can provide her educational needs until college and finish her desire course.  \r\n\r\nIf the loan will be granted to her, Herlosita will no longer borrow from traders and somehow be free from asking credits to them in times of financial needs. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":236955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase farm inputs like fertilizers, seedlings, insecticide and herbicide and pay additional farm labor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T10:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herlosita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":11023.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27042979,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T15:12:09Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T09:28:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78713,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Hu\u1ec7 n\u0103m nay 35 tu\u1ed5i, ch\u1ecb \u0111ang s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 hai con t\u1ea1i huy\u1ec7n Ninh Giang t\u1ec9nh H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng.

Here, Annet keeps layers for eggs and this helps her to bring in a daily income from the sale of eggs alone. She has a hope that in future, she will be able to sell the layers and buy others to replace the current ones. <p>\r\nShe has spent 8 years in the shop business and 2 years with poultry, and her family and business life is far better off as a result of the loans.

This is 47-year-old Mariam K. M.. She is the proud mother of Salim, who is 10, as well as the supporter of one dependent who was orphaned. Mariam is a Tanzanian entrepreneur who has owned a tailoring business since 2004. Mainly she makes and sells clothes at her business; however, sometimes she sells other cloth items, such as bedsheets, at her store in order to meet customer demand.  \r\n<P>\r\nHer business is doing well and she is able to make an average monthly profit of about 200 USD. Mariam is requesting a loan of 800 USD in order to buy an additional sewing machine, cloth, and thread. She is planning to hire more employees because she is currently working for more than 16 hours a day, which is simply too many hours for one individual to sustain. She thanks you in advance for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

He is a farmer in Ahovil\u00e8kom\u00e8 village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and he is a member of the Houedome group GH AYIDOTE MINAWANOU. The inhabitants of this village farm the land after the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river drops. Their lands are rich and highly productive. Their main business activities involve growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these river valley dwellers is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and they spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. At low water they don\u2019t have any money left to pay the workforce that is essential for sowing the land available to them. The local practice of selling off the harvested crops does not provide them with security, moreover, it bankrupts them. This practice involves selling the future harvest at a rock-bottom price to an affluent person to get hold of the money required to carry out the farming. Tired of this practice, they have asked for a loan of 100,000 FCFA ($200) to farm about one hectare of the aforementioned land.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":237210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To farm one hectare of corn and peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T17:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beno\u00eet","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821540,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357806,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046856,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938474,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396140,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-10T18:37:48Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78786,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary A. is currently in the brewing business and is requesting a loan to expand her business.

He is a farmer in Ahovil\u00e8kom\u00e8 village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and he is a member of the Houedome group GH AYIDOTE MINAWANOU. The inhabitants of this village farm the land after the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river drops. Their lands are rich and highly productive. Their main business activities involve growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these river valley dwellers is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and they spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. At low water they don\u2019t have any money left to pay the workforce that is essential for sowing the land available to them. The local practice of selling off the harvested crops does not provide them with security, moreover, it bankrupts them.

He is married and the father of three children, one of whom attends school. He is a farmer in Ahovil\u00e8kom\u00e8 village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and is a member of the HOUEDOME group GH AYIDOTE MINAWANOU. The inhabitants of this village work the land after the fall of the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river. Their land is rich and offers a high yield. Their main activity is growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these riverside residents is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. When the river level drops they do not have any money left to pay for the workforce essential for sowing the available land. The local practice of selling cheaply the harvest does not provide them with financial security and further bankrupts them. This practice involves selling the future harvest at a rock-bottom price to an affluent person in order to have the required money to continue farming. Tired of this practice, they are requesting a loan of 100 000 FCFA (USD 200) to farm about one hectare of the aforementioned land. <p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":237233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To farm one hectare of corn and peppers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T19:30:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821543,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357809,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046859,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938477,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:55Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396143,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25800.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904020,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126028,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-10T23:35:48Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78796,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su conviviente y su peque\u00f1a hija a quien adora mucho.

He is married and the father of five children, three of whom attend school. He is a farmer in Ahovil\u00e8kom\u00e8 village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and is a member of the HOUEDOME group GH AYIDOTE MINAWANOU. The inhabitants of this village work the land after the fall of the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river. Their land is rich and offers a high yield. Their main activity is growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these riverside residents is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. When the river level drops they do not have any money left to pay for the workforce essential for sowing the available land. The local practice of selling cheaply the harvest does not provide them with financial security and further bankrupts them.

He is married and the father of two children, one of whom attends school. He is a farmer in GLAHOUNSA village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and is a member of the HOUEDOME group GH MISSIMAHOU DE GLAHOUNSA. The inhabitants of this village work the land after the fall of the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river. Their land is rich and offers a high yield. Their main activity is growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these riverside residents is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. When the river level drops they do not have any money left to pay for the workforce essential for sowing the available land. The local practice of selling cheaply the harvest does not provide them with financial security and further bankrupts them. This practice involves selling the future harvest at a rock-bottom price to an affluent person in order to have the required money to continue farming. Tired of this practice, they are requesting a loan of 140 000 FCFA (USD 275) to farm about 1.5  hectares of the aforementioned land. <p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":237250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Farming of 1.5 hectares of corn and peppers  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T20:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christophe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":140000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821545,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357811,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046861,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938479,"comment":null},{"amount":83.09,"local_amount":42300,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":42875.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396145,"comment":null},{"amount":20.04,"local_amount":10200,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":10338.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904022,"comment":null},{"amount":34.36,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126030,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T00:27:44Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78808,"name":"Roger","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roger tiene 46 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero, vive junto a su hermana quien siempre le da la mano en su negocio.

She will use the money to expand the space for her buiness and to stock her store with more products. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":237256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Expansion of space for her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":308.27},{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":303.68},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":325.44},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":343.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":353.1},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":366.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100.19},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98.7},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105.77},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111.55},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.76},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100.19,"local_amount":308.27,"processed_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":309.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957871,"comment":null},{"amount":98.7,"local_amount":303.68,"processed_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":305.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228114,"comment":null},{"amount":105.77,"local_amount":325.44,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":327,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423346,"comment":null},{"amount":111.55,"local_amount":343.22,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":344.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116605,"comment":null},{"amount":114.75,"local_amount":353.1,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:52:43Z","rounded_local_amount":354.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011539,"comment":null},{"amount":119.04,"local_amount":366.29,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":368.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595175,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-20T19:36:43Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78811,"name":"Ami","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Ami D. is 38 years old and a married mother of three children.

Y. was born around 1975 in the KESSOUNOU district of DANGBO village. He is married and the father of two children, none of them attend school. He is a farmer in  GLAHOUNSA village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and is a member of the HOUEDOME group GH MISSIMAHOU DE GLAHOUNSA. The inhabitants of this village work the land after the fall of the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river. Their land is rich and offers a high yield. Their main activity is growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these riverside residents is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. When the river level drops they do not have any money left to pay for the workforce essential for sowing the available land.

He is a farmer in  GLAHOUNSA village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and is a member of the HOUEDOME group GH MISSIMAHOU DE GLAHOUNSA. The inhabitants of this village work the land after the fall of the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river. Their land is rich and offers a high yield. Their main activity is growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these riverside residents is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. When the river level drops they do not have any money left to pay for the workforce essential for sowing the available land. The local practice of selling cheaply the harvest does not provide them with financial security and further bankrupts them.

Y. is married and the father of two children who are not enrolled in school. He is a farmer in the village of Glahounsa in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 and is a member of the GH Missimahou Group of Glahounsa. <P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work their fields after the waters of the river Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 have receded.  Their fields are rich and give them a good harvest. Their main crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem of these people who dwell along the river is that, when the river floods, they have no work and spend on food all the money they earned farming. <P>\r\n\r\nWhen the waters recede, they have no money left to pay workers who are indispensable to help them cultivate the area available to them.  At this point many sell the future rights to their harvest which does not make them any more secure, but only makes things worse. They sell the rights to their future harvest to a wealthier person for a laughable sum so that they have enough money to be able to work their fields.<P>\r\n\r\nWeary of this system, David Da Y. is requesting a loan of 140,000 F CFA so as to farm about 1.5 hectares without resorting to \"futures\" speculation.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":237262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"farming 1.5 hectares in corn and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T01:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":140000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821548,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357814,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046864,"comment":null},{"amount":54.01,"local_amount":27500,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:19:24Z","rounded_local_amount":27873.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938482,"comment":null},{"amount":49.11,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":25339.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396148,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904025,"comment":null},{"amount":34.36,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-20T07:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126033,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T03:10:04Z","paid_date":"2009-08-20T07:44:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78820,"name":"Epifania Francisca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francisca, a member of the Manantial (\u201cSpring\u201d) Village Bank, is 50 years old and married with six children, all of whom are now in college.

He is a farmer in the village of Glahounsa in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the GH Missimahou Group of Glahounsa.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work their fields after the waters of the river Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 have receded. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their main crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem of these people who dwell along the river is that, when the river floods, they have no work and spend on food all the money they earned farming.<P>\r\n\r\nWhen the waters recede, they have no money left to pay workers who are indispensable to help them cultivate the area available to them. At this point many sell the future rights to their harvest which does not make them any more secure, but only makes things worse. They sell the rights to their future harvest to a wealthier person for a laughable sum so that they have enough money to be able to work their fields.<P>\r\n\r\nWeary of this system, Abel A. is requesting a loan of 140,000 F CFA so as to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing the above-mentioned crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":237268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"farming 1.5 hectares, raising corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T01:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":140000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821549,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357815,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046865,"comment":null},{"amount":54.01,"local_amount":27500,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":27873.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938483,"comment":null},{"amount":49.11,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":25339.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396149,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904026,"comment":null},{"amount":34.36,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126034,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T01:56:59Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:25:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78823,"name":"Esta K.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings!) from Tanzania!

Tarpuy Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Hatun Tarpuy (\"Big Planting\") Village Bank is located in the Yaruca community, in Huamanga Province of Ayacucho District in central Peru. The Yaruca community is 3,200 meters above sea level and has a frigid climate, so the only local crops are potatoes. It is located on the left bank of the Vinchos River, and has a school for young children as well as an elementary school. Most of the village raises livestock, while some farm. Commerce is restricted to markets, where animals are bought and sold. <p>\r\n\r\nBenedicta and Marcelina are two members of the Hatun Tarpuy Village Bank:  <p>\r\n\r\nBenedicta is married with four children who are 10, 8, 5 and 3 years old. Benedicta used to sell coca leaves to local farmers and travel to Nazca to sell coca and dried cactus plants, which she sold to be turned into dye. Today, she sells prepared meals in the marketplace and, thanks to loans from FINCA Peru, has been able to buy more utensils and serve more meals. She used to have to rush her clients to that they would finish eating and return their dishes, but today they can eat at a relaxed pace. <p>\r\n\r\nBenedicta plans to use her Kiva loan to buy bread, cheese and clothing to sell in the market. She dreams that her children will someday graduate with professional degrees, so as a start she wants to take them to the city of Ayacucho to get an education. She is saving for their sake and to be able to deal with any difficulties that might arise along the way.<p>\r\n\r\nMarcelina is married and has eight children ranging in age from 23 to 4 years old. She launched her business six years ago selling meals in local markets, and today she buys chickens, cheeses and cows to sell in Ayacucho and also owns a dry goods store.

He is the oldest child and lives in his parents' house with his younger siblings.  In his village, Cesar works the land from November until May, taking utmost care in planting, and the rest of the year he grazes livestock.  Every weekend he goes to the city to go shopping and to visit his relatives.  They are very grateful to him for his agricultural work, but the bad thing is that he cannot rely heavily on the crops because they are seasonal, so he has to wait for the rain for the seeds to germinate.  He has planted 2 hectares of potatoes and is worried about the lack of rain.  He therefore longs to purchase irrigated land, so that he no longer has to worry about the rain or ice, which can cause him to lose his crops.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Her husband has worked in agriculture since he was very young and she helps him, especially during the planting seasons.  On other days of the week, she sells candy from the door of her house.  Her clients are the children that are leaving school and eat what she sells.  On class days, her sales are good, but when there are not classes, she takes the opportunity to go to the farm.  Her desire is to set up her house to have a small convenience store.  She thinks that it would do very well in being profitable, and at the same time she would not have the need to go to another store.  Above all, she tries to generate more income for her finances.  At the moment things are a little difficult because of a lack of money.  This is her ninth loan with MFP (Microfinanzas PRISMA, a Kiva field partner) and she makes her payments punctually.  She is very grateful to the MFI (microfinance institution) for helping her repeated times.  With the requested money, she will purchase supplies such as rice, sugar, and other products to start up her small store.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Megan Tatman Montgomery, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":237340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase supplies to start up her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210692,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T20:42:46Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78842,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A sus 40 a\u00f1os de edad Francisca, aun convive con el padre de sus seis hijos, de los cuales cinco viven con ella.

This is 30-year-old Bitris B. from Kyela. She is married with three children between the ages of one and 13. Bitris has been running a used clothing business since 2005. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Dar es Salaam to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets of Dar es Salaam and the surrounding towns and villages. \r\n<P>\r\nThese clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially among the younger generation, because they are so cheap and because of the general appeal of anything western or modern. Many people argue that the popularity of the West\u2019s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. Although there are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress, the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.\r\n<P>\r\nBitris works at her business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Bitris  currently earns about 220 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 325 USD in order to purchase more used clothes and cocoa in bulk. In the future, she plans to expand her business by adding more clothes for reselling.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":237352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase more used clothes and cocoa in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bitris M.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more shoes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-30T00:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oliver F.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Kiko's parents were farmers.  They grew potatoes in large quantities, but had a bad season where they were left without money.  After that, starting five years ago Kiko worked in the farms of his neighbors.  They paid him 15 Soles daily, including lunch.  And about 2 years ago he began to farm his own plot of land, where he is cultivating two hectares of potatoes and another little bit of peas.  When he harvests, he takes them to the markets and this gives him much satisfaction.

The group is part of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari Project, an effort to proviD. microloans to people who live far from FINCA\u2019s Ayacucho office by sending loan officers out to the villages in which the clients themselves live. Fourteen group members live in the village of Santa Barbara, while six live in the neighboring villages of Huaynacondo and \u00d1eque. <p>\r\n\r\nThe group members are involved in a variety of businesses, but the most common economic activity is raising guinea pigs, or \u201ccuyes,\u201d a Peruvian delicacy. Some clients have just a few dozen guinea pigs, while others have many more. Gloria Susana, for example, has almost 500 guinea pigs, breeding, raising, and selling them to stores, restaurants and individuals to prepare. <p>\r\n\r\nGuinea pigs are very delicate, temperature-sensitive animals, so caring for them is quite labor-intensive. Many clients go out themselves at 4 or 5 p.m. each day to cut fresh alfalfa to feed them. Some other group members raise different animals, large and small, such as chickens, cows, and sheep, which they then fatten up and sell at livestock fairs. <p>\r\n\r\nOther group members sell dry goods and grains; many travel between Santa Barbara and the city of Ayacucho (which is about an hour away by car) to buy, sell or traD. their wares. <p>\r\n\r\nMost of the members plan to use their loans to buy more merchandise to sell, more young animals to raise, or more materials to make their products. Ambrosio, for example, buys seasonal local produce which he loads into a rented truck and brings to the city of Lima to sell. Right now, it is prickly pear season, so he will use his share of the loan to buy boxes of prickly pears. Leonardo is a basket-weaver, so he will use his loan to buy more reeds to make his baskets. Leonarda has a small store and also raises guinea pigs; she will use her loan portion to buy rice, sugar and soda to sell. <p>\r\n\r\nThe group is pictured along with their loan officer, Hector (far

With this level of income, L\u1eadp's family now has the ability to improve their standard of living and to invest in their children's education.  \r\nIn the next lending cycle, she would like to

Ayacucho Department of central Peru, about 3,200 meters above sea level and about 50 km outsiD. the city of Ayacucho. It is located on a major highway, so most of the village is involved in commerce. The zone also produces corn, potatoes, and barley, and some villagers raise livestock. \r\n\t\r\nLeonor and Luzmila are two members of the Sumaq Huaytas Village Bank:\r\n\r\nLeonor, married with four children who are 17, 16, 13 and 11 years old, runs a small dry goods store, a business she launched two years ago. She plans to use her loan portion to buy more merchandise for her dry gods store as well as sheep to take to Ayacucho to sell for meat.  Her dreams for the future are that her children will graduate with professional degrees and that her business will grow. She is saving for any emergencies that might arise involving her family.  \r\n\r\nLuzmila, married with six children between the ages of 27 and 12, buys small pigs and fattens them up to sell for a higher price. She also raises guinea pigs, a local delicacy, to sell in the city of Ayacucho. A veteran of this business, Luzmila says that when she was first starting out, her lack of experience led to some mistakes, but now she knows the business very well. With the help of loans from FINCA, she has increased her income and improved her business. \r\n\r\nLuzmila plans to use her portion of the loan to buy more young pigs, and dreams of her children growing up to be working professionals so that they don\u2019t have to face the same hardships she has endured. She would also like to open up a large dry goods store. She is currently saving up to buy more commodities such as rice and sugar to sell door-to-door and to traD. for barley and wheat which she can grind up and use to fatten up her pigs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":237645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy young pigs, sheep and dry goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-12-12T16:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salome","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teofila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celedonia Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luzmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8400,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":454.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":454.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":454.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":454.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":454.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":454.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":454.17,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1404.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932947,"comment":null},{"amount":454.17,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:09:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1404.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215221,"comment":null},{"amount":454.17,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1404.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396931,"comment":null},{"amount":454.17,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1404.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088608,"comment":null},{"amount":454.16,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1404.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35981992,"comment":null},{"amount":454.16,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:51:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1404.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442730,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T15:52:58Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:51:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":78961,"name":"Bopha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bopha V., 26, and her husband, Mr. Rithy Nuon, 30, live in a small village across the Mekong River about 20 kilometers from Phnom Penh.

Apronia thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":237776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase maize, beans and rice.

D.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 44-year-old Chausiku M. from Kyela. She is married with four children, between the ages of 10 and 28. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting 2 dependants who are orphans. Chausiku has been running a local restaurant, 'Mama Lishe', since 1996. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is 'restaurant' or 'caf\u00e9', you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all-local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.<p>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9-21 hours per day, 7 days per week. Chausiku currently earns about $170 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $250 USD in order to purchase additional stock of maize flour, rice, beans, and cooking oil. In the future, she plans to establish another business and to employ more workers. Chausiku thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":237783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase additional stock of maize flour, rice, beans, and cooking oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-13T01:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chausiku D.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14887047,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436307,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130579,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027376,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613377,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:03Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010457,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-13T04:06:02Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79003,"name":"Sharifan Riasat Ali Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sharifan Baji (\"baji\" is an honorific meaning older sister) is a group leader of a few women in her locality.

S., 36, is married and lives with her four children in the Kampong Cham province. She is a farmer who makes around US $2 each day, while her husband works selling ice cream and makes $6 a day. Three of their children are students and one is too young to attend school. The agriculture industry has really suffered in Cambodia over the past year, as the climate has had unfavorable conditions and inflation has been high.

He is a farmer in the village of Glahounsa in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and a member of the GH Missimahou Group of Glahounsa. <P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede they have no money left to pay laborers who are indispensible to them in cultivating the land they own.  <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Daniel A. has requested a loan of 100,000 F CFA which will allow him to farm about 1 hectare, growing the aforementioned crops.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":237830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"farming of 1 hectare, in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T16:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821551,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357817,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046867,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938485,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396151,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25800.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904028,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126036,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T20:10:36Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79032,"name":"Un","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Un S., 40, is married and resides with her husband and six of their children in the Kampong Cham province of Cambodia.

He is a farmer in the village of Glahounsa in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and a member of the GH Missimahou group of Glahounsa. <P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay laborers who are indispensible to them in cultivating their land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Emmanuel A. has requested a loan of 100,000 F CFA which will allow him to farm about 1 hectare, growing the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":237833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"farming one hectare, growing corn and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T16:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821552,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357818,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046868,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938486,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396152,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":25800.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904029,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T21:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126037,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T19:36:25Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T21:51:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79034,"name":"Lon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lon S., 48, is a wedding chef who lives with her husband (pictured) in the Kampong Cham province of Cambodia.

This explains why selling soft drinks is such a popular venture, whether you\u2019re the CEO of Coca Cola Ltd in the United States or a micro-entrepreneur in Tanzania! \r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":237841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay laborers who are indispensible to them in getting their land sown.  <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Pierre A. has requested a loan of 180,000 F CFA which will allow him to farm about 2 hectares, growing the aforementioned crops.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":237843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"cultivating 2 hectares in corn and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T17:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pierre","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":180000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":22500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821554,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357820,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:37Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046870,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938488,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396154,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":45000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":45151.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904031,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":22500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":22575.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126039,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-12T20:42:15Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79042,"name":"Mwanne K.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings!) from Tanzania!

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more

Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay laborers who are indispensible to them in getting their land sown.<P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming.

She is also responsible for supporting two other dependants, because one is orphan and the other has parents, but they cannot take care for him. \n\nNeema buys crops from farmers and brings them at town where she can sell them at higher price. Neema  has been running her crop business since 2007. \n\nShe works at her business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband.

Neema thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":237850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more rice in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-30T00:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema M.

He is a farmer in the village of Glahounsa in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and is a member of the GM Senablo group of Glahounsa.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay laborers who are indispensible to them in getting their land sown.<P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Sourou B. has requested a loan of 130,000 F CFA which will allow him to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing the aforementioned crops. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":237856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"farming 1.5 hectares of land, growing maize (corn) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T17:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sourou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":130000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821556,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357822,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046872,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938490,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396156,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":32500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":35475.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904033,"comment":null},{"amount":34.39,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126041,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-12T04:04:03Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79052,"name":"Muyassarjon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muyassarjon D. lives in the B.Gafurov region.

This is 40-year-old Cristina K. from Mbarali. She married with five children between the ages of 2 and 15.Cristina has been running a maize business since 2000. She buys maize from farmers and brings them back to her town where she can sell them for a higher price. She works at her business for 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by her husband. \n\nShe is requesting a loan of 500 USD in order to purchase more maize in bulk. In the future, she plans to establish another business. Cristina thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

I was able to give my children their desired education with the help of my husband, and I have never stopped dreaming,\u201d Amelia said. Even though her children are grown, she continues to work hard to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAmalia lives at Barangay Malamag East Tumauini, Isabela. Their village is surrounded by farmland where villagers plant vegetables, corn and tobacco. It is also a flood-prone area, and when heavy rains come, water overflows in Cagayan River (the longest River in the Philippines) and passes through their area. Water reaches their house and oftentimes destroys their crops. She is married to Leon who owns a tricycle and also manages their farmland. They have two children namely: Eva (24 years old) and Lailanie (28 years old), both finished their vocational course in college.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to purchase additional stalls in the public market or in other villages and increase her stock of  rice and grocery items. This will increase her earnings. She says that in her experience, more blessings come her way whenever she works hard and continues to thank the Lord.

He is a farmer in the village of Glahounsa in the valley of the  Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GM Senablo of Glahounsa. <P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing the land.  <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Donatien Pierre K.  has requested a loan of 130,000 F CFA which will allow him to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing the aforementioned crops.  \r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":237859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T18:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Donatien Pierre","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":130000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821557,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357823,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046873,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938491,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396157,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":32500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":35475.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904034,"comment":null},{"amount":34.39,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-21T07:47:01Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126042,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T23:47:59Z","paid_date":"2009-08-21T07:47:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79061,"name":"Edner","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Edner B.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

She is a farmer in the village of Glahounsa in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GM Senablo of Glahounsa.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land.\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Anne Z. has requested a loan of 100,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1 hectare, growing some of the aforementioned crops.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":237875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"cultivating 1 hectare in maize (corn) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T18:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821558,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357824,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046874,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938492,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":25800.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396158,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904035,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-16T16:55:52Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126043,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T21:09:17Z","paid_date":"2009-08-16T16:55:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79065,"name":"Bahry","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bahry O. was born in 1955 in the B.Gafurov region of Tajikistan.

Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land.\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice,  F\u00e9licienne A. has requested a loan of 100,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1 hectare, growing some of the aforementioned crops. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":237877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"cultivating 1 hectare in maize (corn) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T18:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"F\u00e9licienne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821559,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357825,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046875,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938493,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:55Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396159,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25800.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904036,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126044,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T23:47:02Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79068,"name":"Nazira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nazira A. is 52 years old.

The civil war, which took place soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., severely damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in agricultural production and the manufacturing sector.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  All of these factors have resulted in a severe lack of jobs and have forced hundreds of thousands to leave Tajikistan to find work in other countries, mostly in Russia.  While Tajikistan has experienced some economic growth since the end of the Civil War, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON International's mission is to promote sustainable economic development and improved quality of life in Tajikistan by insuring reliable access to financial services for the economically active members of the population. IMON International has 8 branch offices throughout Tajikistan and their entrepreneurs work in many parts of the country's economic sector including trade, manufacturing, agriculture, and services. As of  October 2008, IMON International had 27,802 active clients and a total portfolio of $28,405,549.  Approximately 44% of these clients are women and 65% are from rural areas.

A. is married and the mother of 6 children, of whom one is enrolled in school. She is a farmer in the village of Glahounsa in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GM Senablo of Glahounsa.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land.<P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, C\u00e9line S. A. has requested a loan of 100,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1 hectare, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":237880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"cultivating 1 hectare in maize (corn) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T18:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"C\u00e9line","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821560,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357826,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046876,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938494,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":25800.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396160,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904037,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126045,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T23:21:28Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:25:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79070,"name":"Mary Gay Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In a village where unity and cooperation are manifested through active participation during the yearly festival, you will find a sari-sari store (a community based store) owned by Marie Gay Rose R.. \r\n\r\nMarie Gay, 40, lives in the village of Magsaysay Naguillan, Isabela and is married to Perlito who drives heavy equipment for a local construction firm.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":237886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase an additional corn drying machine and more maize.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-14T11:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14887052,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436313,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130585,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027382,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613383,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010463,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-14T20:12:36Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79072,"name":"Cornelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cornelia M. is married to Pedro, a simple farmer.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The civil war, which took place soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., severely damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  All of these factors have resulted in a severe lack of jobs and have forced hundreds of thousands to leave Tajikistan to find work in other countries, mostly in Russia.  While Tajikistan has experienced some economic growth since the end of the Civil War, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON International's mission is to promote sustainable economic development and improved quality of life in Tajikistan by insuring reliable access to financial services for the economically active members of the population.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":237895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

H. is a widow living in Penjikent, Tajikistan with her only son. Khursandoy runs a small business selling men\u2019s shoes and clothing in the local market. She has been involved in this trade for 12 years. She recently moved her vending facility to a different location which has brought an increase in her sales.  Khursandoy has many loyal customers. She is very friendly and amiable with each client, thus Khursandoy has a unique talent of attracting new customers. Khursandoy purchases clothing wholesale every week. She is hoping to use the loan of $750 to purchase winter clothing and shoes for men. She hopes to see her venture grow big enough to afford to buy a new vending facility in the future.  \r\n\r\nTajikistan is one of the poorer of the 15 former Soviet republics, with a GDP per capita of less than $600. The civil war, which took place soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., severely damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in agricultural production and the manufacturing sector.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  All of these factors have resulted in a severe lack of jobs and have forced hundreds of thousands to leave Tajikistan to find work in other countries, mostly in Russia.  While Tajikistan has experienced some economic growth since the end of the civil war, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON International's mission is to promote sustainable economic development and improved quality of life in Tajikistan by insuring reliable access to financial services for the economically active members of the population. IMON International has 8 branch offices throughout Tajikistan and their entrepreneurs work in many parts of the country's economic sector including trade, manufacturing, agriculture, and services. As of October 2008, IMON International had 27,802 active clients and a total portfolio of $28,405,549.  Approximately 44% of these clients are women and 65% are from rural areas.

M. is 45 years old. She works purchasing and reselling cows with her husband. She has 3 children, two of whom are already students. Sanobar would like to request a loan of $ 750 for the term of 12 months in order to purchase additional cows to increase her inventory and to meet customer demand. She believes this will lead to greater revenue and, ultimately, greater profit for her family. In the future, she would like to reinvest the earnings generated by this loan back into her business to purchase additional cows and to increase their income further. Sanobar and her husband plan to use the increased income to fund their children\u2019s education.  \r\n\r\nAbout Tajikistan: \r\n\r\nTajikistan is one of the poorer of the 15 former Soviet republics, with a GDP per capita of less than $600. The civil war, which took place soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., severely damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in agricultural production and the manufacturing sector.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  All of these factors have resulted in a severe lack of jobs and have forced hundreds of thousands to leave Tajikistan to find work in other countries, mostly in Russia.  While Tajikistan has experienced some economic growth since the end of the Civil War, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nAbout IMON International: \r\n\r\nIMON International's mission is to promote sustainable economic development and improved quality of life in Tajikistan by insuring reliable access to financial services for the economically active members of the population.

Nuriddin is 51 years old and was born in Penjikent, Tajikistan. He is the father of three children, and his main work consists of breeding cattle. This very remunerative activity enables him to provide for the needs of his family. A very ambitious man, he would like to buy a greater number of cattle, and to build a farmhouse to house them in order to ensure their safety. Due to a lack of finances, he is asking for a loan of 500 Somoni ($ 150 USD) for the realization of this project. He promises to repay the loan in 12 months. When his dream is carried out, he will be able to have a greater source of revenue for his growing family. With your help this will be possible.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota where the hot springs of Dangbo are located, in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River, and he is a member of the group GM Miwanou of Hetin Sota. <P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in B\u00e9nin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs.

He is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota where the hot springs of Dangbo are located, in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River, and he is a member of the group GM Miwanou of Hetin Sota. <P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in B\u00e9nin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Maurice B. has requested a loan of 165,000 F CFA which will allow him to farm about 2 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":237916,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"cultivating 2 hectares in corn and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T18:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maurice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":165000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821564,"comment":null},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357830,"comment":null},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046880,"comment":null},{"amount":153.88,"local_amount":78125,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":79405.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938498,"comment":null},{"amount":8.62,"local_amount":4375,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4446.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904041,"comment":null},{"amount":40.64,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-20T07:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126049,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T20:51:47Z","paid_date":"2009-08-20T07:44:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79094,"name":"Christiana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christiana Q. is a 27-year-old single mother of one child.

He is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota where the hot springs of Dangbo are located, in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River, and he is a member of the group GM Miwanou of Hetin Sota. <P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in B\u00e9nin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs.

A. S. is a 39-year-old mother of two, who are currently in school. The elder one, a son, is now in his fourth year at the medical school of the University of Science and Technology Ghana. \r\n\r\nShe is very supportive to her husband in taking care of her children in school. She has been operating a seamstress shop for the past five years. She is training one young lady in sewing to equip her with the skills and experience for a future career. She sews all forms of women's wear with various kinds of styles like kaba and slit (a variation of the European long skirt and tailored top), wedding dress, funeral clothes, etc. \r\n\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy more sewing material like linen, threads, thimbles, etc., in order to increase her output and efficiency.

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Mahukpego of Hetin Sota. She also sells fish and hot peppers.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs.

Mayasa thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, which is why they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy food containers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:43Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14887055,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436316,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130588,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027385,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613386,"comment":null},{"amount":70.85,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":87833.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010466,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T12:26:02Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79106,"name":"Rosaline","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e vers 1973 \u00e0  AHOVILECOME  dans la commune de DANGBO, dame   D.

Y. is married and the mother of 4 children, of whom two are enrolled in school. She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Mahukpego of Hetin Sota. She also sells smoked fish and palm oil.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, which is why they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":237932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To buy rice in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronika H.

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Djidjoho of Hetin Sota, situated near the hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells rice.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. \r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Elisabeth S. has requested a loan of 120,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":237933,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-02-11T11:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elisabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":32250.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357836,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046886,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938504,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":32250.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396169,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904047,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126055,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-11T15:22:44Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79110,"name":"Phidel","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce brave monsieur vend du poisson au quai de p\u00eache de Boudody.

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Djidjoho of Hetin Sota, situated near the hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells rice. <P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Sidonie H. has requested a loan of 120,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":237937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-12T21:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sidonie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821568,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357837,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046887,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938505,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396170,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":32250.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904048,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:02Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126056,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-12T22:54:50Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79112,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret A. is 30 years old and married with five children.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":237945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To renovate her office","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rhoida S.

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Djidjoho of Hetin Sota, located near the hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells drinks.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":237950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","use":"To

Weary of this practice, Julienne K.  has requested a loan of 110,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":237957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-01-13T05:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julienne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":110000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821569,"comment":null},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357841,"comment":null},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046891,"comment":null},{"amount":89.48,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":46177.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938509,"comment":null},{"amount":23.01,"local_amount":11250,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":11874.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904052,"comment":null},{"amount":28.15,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126060,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-13T14:02:01Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79126,"name":"Zelea M.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (greetings) from Tanzania! This is 30-year-old Zelea G. from Mbarali. She is single but has 3 children, between the ages of 3 and 13.  Zelea has been running a local restaurant, \u201cMama Lishe\u201d since 2002. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all-local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.<p>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 13-16 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by her mother. She currently earns about 200USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to purchase more rice in bulk. In the future, she plans to establish another business. Zelea  thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more rice in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zelea M.

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Djidjoho of Hetin Sota, located near the hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells fish.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Weary of this practice, Jeanne A. has requested a loan of 120,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":237965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-01-13T05:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeanne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821571,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357843,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046893,"comment":null},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":31500,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":33863.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938511,"comment":null},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":28500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:00Z","rounded_local_amount":30638.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904054,"comment":null},{"amount":31.26,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126062,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-13T08:53:33Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79133,"name":"La Alianza Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"La Alianza is a group from an extremely poor area in San Pedro, Dominican Republic. In this group, many of the women have already received loans and have their own small business. Dionicia S. is the group representative, and a great example of the power of micro-credit. She came to Esperanza International with no form of income and was living in extreme poverty. Dionicia is the mother of 4 older children, and had to give everything she had just to feed them. As her children got older and she started to have a little more time she realized she wanted something different from her life, and knew she had to do something about it. She then applied for a small loan so she could start her own small store, which she started as a small stand in her neighborhood. She sold simple things like candy, rice, and other cheaper items. She worked hard and was able to increase her business to the point today where she has her own small store! She is finally making some good money, and is happy with what she is doing. She can finally save money and help out her children when they need it. She finally feels like she can provide, and feels like she has something of her own. She is a great story of success, and is continuing to increase her business.

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Wangnime of Hetin Sota, located near the hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells drinks and flour.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs.

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Wangnime of Hetin Sota, located near the hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells flour and drinks.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Bod\u00e9 Agathe A. has requested a loan of 110,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":237973,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-01-13T05:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bod\u00e9 Agathe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":110000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821574,"comment":null},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357846,"comment":null},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046896,"comment":null},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938514,"comment":null},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396177,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":27500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":29025.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904057,"comment":null},{"amount":28.14,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T21:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126065,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-13T10:48:06Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T21:51:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":79140,"name":"Lidia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lidia is a member of the Azucenas (\u201cWhite Lilies\u201d) Village Bank.
