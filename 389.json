They are responsible people who know each other well and guarantee each other's repayment of the loan.\r\n\r\nEdilia is the president of the group. She is married and has three school-aged children. She sells cosmetics from catalogs and also sells clothing seasonally. Her husband is a salaried driver, but his pay does not cover their household's expenses so Edilia has her two businesses to help meet her family's needs. She will use the money from the loan to purchase cosmetics while they are on sale to later sell at full price and in that way make a better profit. She is a responsible, dynamic, and hardworking member of the group, and for this reason they named her president.\r\n\r\nAll of the group's members are responsible and dynamic and are working hard to help their families get ahead.

Her first son works at a body shop, and the money he makes he uses for personal expenses and for his education at a distant school. Her second son helps with household chores, and her two youngest children go to a community school. Her husband works in construction. They live in a small home made of planks. Mar\u00eda has made ropes since she was very young. She learned the craft from her mother and it has now become a way of life. She works in her free time since she has to tend to the household chores and care for her youngest children. She is very content to belong to a community bank with women who are always looking for a better way to make headway for their families.

Among their plans for the future is introducing new crops that are mass consumed.  \r\n\r\nPrior to doing this, however, they need funds to buy farm supplies like: fertilizers, seed and other supplies that they hope will increase their crop yields and their profits to be reinvested either into the business or to cover personal and family expenses that will improve the entire family\u2019s socio-economic standing.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":528468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy farm supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-04-24T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":7000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":7378.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097820,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T04:16:57Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":195104,"name":"Fatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Fatou B. est une dame de 48 ans qui habite a Nimzath Guediawaye et qui est membre de l\u2019U-IMCEC  a  la caisse de Baye Laye depuis 2002.

working for years as a nanny, Guadalupe finally felt ready to go into business for herself when she discovered a program that helps to train and certify would-be daycare owners. In this comprehensive program, Guadalupe learned how to set up her business and manage its costs, and took classes about child development to prepare herself for the wide variety of children that she would care for. Upon graduation, Guadalupe transformed her home into 'My Little World Childcare'. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe\u2019s daycare center is a \u2018home away from home\u2019 for the children, and she has tight bonds with the children she cares for. \u201cI love celebrating their birthdays,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful to watch them grow up. I get to see them get their first tooth and learn how to walk.\u201d Each day she tracks their eating habits, how they slept, and any unusual behavior, and makes reports to their parents. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe received a microloan from Opportunity Fund in 2007 to renovate her backyard and turn it into a better, safer play space for the children. She now has swing sets, a playhouse, and other toys, and the children spend time outside whenever possible. \u201cIf I had not received a loan from Opportunity Fund I still would have tried to make the safety improvements to my center, but they might not have been enough. I am afraid it could have been dangerous.\u201d \r\n\r\nWith a second loan through Opportunity Fund, this one for $8,000, Guadalupe will be able to purchase a computer to track her business expenses and a van to take the children on field trips to the nearby park and museums. She will also install a fence to separate her front yard from the street.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":8000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4641.19,"image":{"id":528491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child

Through this business she has become well-known in her neighborhood.  Every weekend she opens her business and everyone comes by to savor her dishes.  At the same time, Gloria takes the time to offer beauty products to some of her exclusive customers since they are guaranteed to make payments for the products they order.  What she enjoys most about her job is the interaction with people, which helps to make her business profitable.  She has been in this venture for two years and plans to continue selling beauty products and preparing tamales.  In the future, she plans to buy a display case so that she can exhibit her beauty products and prevent her grandchildren from touching and damaging the merchandise.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Gloria promises to be punctual with each of her payments because she wants to rely on subsequent loans in the future.  She also hopes to blend in with her group and look out for the welfare of her fellow Communal Bank members.  With the loan she requested, Gloria will buy more beauty products so that she will have a greater variety, thereby increasing her earnings.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica,

For the past five years, he has been selling fruit as his main source of income.  In the past few months, he has noticed a rise in the price of fruit, which has made it difficult for him to purchase more merchandise.  This is the reason why he is applying for a loan, so that he can buy a larger inventory of fruit, which would then increase his sales due to the high demand that occurs during the summer months.  With the warmer climate, his clients tend to purchase more fruit and he wants to be able and ready to take full advantage of this tendency.  The help that he is asking for would help him in reaching this objective and thus adding to the socio-economic stability of his family.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy

The owner, Ernestina C. R., 52, is a stout-hearted woman who provides careful attention to every person who enters this business, which has given her everything and to which she has dedicated herself.  Ever since she was left a widow with 3 children, she has been responsible for all of the income and decisions of the home.  Through her efforts she has managed to put her children through school.  Already one of them is a professional, and he has a  family and a new income to cover the household expenses.  Ernestina's business meets the needs of neighboring families, who use it to access grocery products that are typically bought by local households.  She needs a loan in the amount of $2.3 million Colombian pesos to invest in the purchase of cooking oil, rice, grains, drinks, and meats, in particular.  This is her 3rd loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo; with the loans she has taken from this organization she has managed to increase her sales and support the education of her children.  Her dream is to see her two unmarried children become professionals and have the possibility of a better future.  Ernestina takes great care to improve the services to her customers so that her business will be sustainable in the market and her income will increase over time.  Her greatest challenge was being left alone with 3 children after the death of her husband.  She wants to expand her ability to receive credit so that she can provide a better offering of products to her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

She has 20 years of experience, and the different activities she has done to support herself are proof of that.  In her house everyone works.  Her husband is a taxi driver.  They have two children, 20 and 23 years old.  They also work.  They are the exact reason that she started her business.\r\n\r\nShe started in order to add another income to the household and to invest in their education.  Her husband had a great responsibility with the household expenses, and she considered it her duty to help him with this objective.\r\n\r\nShe started selling cakes to her neighbors.  She was expanding and adding other products like cheese, which she sells by the pound or kilo at the customer\u2019s request.  She observes her customers, and Yadira has come to understand other needs.\r\n\r\nShe also started selling various merchandise like domestic appliances, clothes, and footwear.  She interacts in the three businesses, and each time they show their potential for growth.\r\n\r\nWith this perception, she came to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to request her first loan.  She wants to buy cheese in greater quantities as she knows that it is very profitable.  She also wants to buy small domestic appliances, cosmetics, and clothes for women to respond to her customers\u2019 orders.  They need to give gifts for the celebration of Mother\u2019s Day in May.  \r\n\r\nYoung adults, men, and women wrap the gifts for their mothers, mothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, and even their neighbors or friends.  They buy gifts for their biological mothers or anyone who has filled the roll of mother.\r\n\r\nYadira, age 50, is a hard-working woman who primarily dreams of the growth of her business.  In the future she sees her business with a better infrastructure, and she sees herself tenaciously helping her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":528395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy cheese in larger quantities, domestic appliances, cosmetics, and clothes for women","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-04-24T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yadira Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2080000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":138470},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":157243},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160519},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":163863},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167277},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":170762},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":174320},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":177951},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":181659},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":185443},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":189307},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":213186}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.57},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.26},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.96},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.09},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.97},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.89},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.57,"local_amount":138470,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":139222.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895836,"comment":null},{"amount":81.26,"local_amount":157243,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":158097.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636164,"comment":null},{"amount":82.96,"local_amount":160519,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":161391.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850261,"comment":null},{"amount":84.69,"local_amount":163863,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":164753.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117021,"comment":null},{"amount":86.46,"local_amount":167277,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":168185.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410890,"comment":null},{"amount":178.34,"local_amount":345082,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":346956.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688147,"comment":null},{"amount":185.86,"local_amount":359610,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":361563.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000800,"comment":null},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":185443,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":186450.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288815,"comment":null},{"amount":97.84,"local_amount":189307,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":190335.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206156977,"comment":null},{"amount":110.18,"local_amount":213186,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":214344.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211229999,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-05-19T01:53:07Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":195128,"name":"Amigas Luchadoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este comit\u00e9 se form\u00f3 en el Barrio Bernardino Caballero D. la Ciudad D.

Ofelia is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and then sell in the future. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Ofelia from GDMPC.

This same group is obtaining their third credit with Mol Bulak Finance.  They worked off all of the previous loans very well.  Every one of the women achieve their goal by obtaining a loan with MBF, however, they all have one goal to strive for, which is to improve their welfare and provide the best for their children.  Let\u2019s begin the presentation of the group with its leader. \r\n\r\nZebi is 61 years old.  Her husband works as a veterinarian in the village.  Not only does the health of livestock depend on him, but also the welfare of the village population.  Losses of livestock mean losses of incomes of the families who live here.  Zebi is also involved in animal husbandry.  She plans to use this loan to buy a sheep and one calf.\r\n\r\nGulnara is 55 years old, married.  Her husband works as a security guard at a local school.  She has 8 children: 6 daughters and 2 sons.  The majority of participants are involved in breeding and fattening of domestic livestock.  Gulnara is also not an exception.  She has been involved in this business since 1976.  Now she wants to buy a cow with a calf in order to obtain and sell dairy products.\r\n\r\nErkin is 56 years old.  She was previously involved in farming and grew tobacco.  Now she is involved in animal husbandry.  Her children and husband help her with the business.  The goal of the loan is to buy cattle.\r\n\r\nSavirahon is a widow with 4 children.  She has 3 sons and a daughter.  She plans to purchase a sheep.\r\n\r\nKadicha is 55 years old, a widow.

This will be Nimfa's fifth loan from HSPFI.

owns a retail business that sells various agricultural products, including seeds, fertilizers, and bug killers. Yuliya has a large assortment of products, affordable prices, and a good reputation at the market. She has many repeat clients who buy items from her to use on their gardens.\r\n\r\nYuliya has been in this business for thirteen years. The business is seasonal; she sells most of her items in spring and summer.

K. is a 36 year-old married man living in the South Rift Valley of Kenya, near the town of Litein. He has six children, ranging in age from less than one year to 12 years old. All the children but the youngest are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nJonah has been running his mixed farm for 18 years now. He previously worked as a tea-plucker for other farmers. He now earns his income selling milk, tea, and maize. He says that lately the main challenges to his business are poor seeds, lack of water from drought and lack of sufficient feed for his livestock.\r\n\r\nJonah has a successful history with Juhudi Kilimo, previously completing a loan of 45,000 KES.

Usmonbek is a 37-year-old businessman. He is married and together with his wife they have 4 children. Usmonbek is a farmer, like his wife. They started their work 15 years ago. The beginning was very difficult, because they needed to invest a lot of working capital. With much effort and the help of his wife, he was able to move forward and today has a large plot of land. \r\n\r\nHis vegetables are very good quality which he says is due to the constant irrigation they receive since the business has a complete underground irrigation system. Usmonbek requests the loan for the purchase of fertilizer and seeds. This will allow him to better provide for his family.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Khalifa, 52, is married and has four children. He lives in Djabbar Rasulov district and works with his family in the agricultural industry.

He did so to generate more income that would enable him to support his family. \r\n\r\nAt the same time Khalifa raises cattle near his house. He will use the loan money to buy young cattle to raise. Khalifa has discovered over the years that he enjoys doing this job, and that's why he will continue to use loans in order to improve his business. \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ikrom is 24 years old. He is married and has two kids. This gentleman is a vegetable producer with more than six years of experience. Ikrom works all day on the land. He is involved in the whole production process, including post-harvest and selling. It is relevant to explain that the production of vegetables requires adequate fertilizer in order to generate the expected harvest. Nutrients and chemical fertilizers are needed throughout the process. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Ikrom is having difficulties getting into the market with his product due to the fact that he doesn't have enough organic matter to incorporate into the soil. There isn\u2019t enough fertilizer and the soils are poor in nutrients. It is for these reasons that his harvests aren\u2019t going well. Ikrom lacks the capital to be able to correctly prepare the land and thereby achieve a successful harvest so that he can sell his vegetables in the different markets. He is hoping for your generosity and is very thankful to all of you.    \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This man has been a farmer for more than 5 years. Together with his family he grows diverse products such as cucumbers, onions, wheat, barley and other vegetables. What pleases him is sowing his diverse crops as it is profitable to invest in a variety of vegetables and sell his harvest monthly, according to market demand. But the most tedious part is having to clear his land and take care of his crops day after day. This is his first loan with IMON International and he is promising to repay the loan ion time, not letting down anyone. Nasirullo will invest the money in purchasing seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. \r\n\r\n More about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

together with her partner, has a small business selling construction supplies in their store which has lately been expanded. Their store is filled with attractive, reasonably priced items that appeal to many customers who are looking to build something like an office, a house, etc. \r\n\r\nMiyansarkhon has been in business for about 4 years. She likes what she sells and has developed a stable enterprise. Currently she has requested a loan to help purchase a new supply of items to sell. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

J. is a hardworking father with responsibility of taking care of his wife and three children, who are the driving force for his work. Every day, early in the morning, Pirnazar leaves to take care of his farmland, which he irrigates and fertilizes so his crops will produce, and then when the harvest comes he can sell good quality products to sell for his income. His wife and children also help him with his business. One of this couple\u2019s dreams is to educate their children with higher education so that one day they\u2019ll become great people. They are asking for the current loan to buy seed, fertilizer and other supplies necessary for farming their land and increasing their crop production.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her business with her modest earnings is, in her own estimation, now standing in good stead.\r\n\r\nSophia principally sells dried and smoked fish. Season in, season out, she has made headway in a business flagged off its feet by her husband. Prior to bearing a hand in this business, she was a farmer. Her only child, as one of the testaments of her success, is now going to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan coming her way, Sophia foresees her flood tide of success continuing as she says she will be able to buy more quality fish to sell.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With this his revenue will increase and he will be able to finance his children's education to higher level and also to meet his family's daily needs.\r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a hardworking farmer in Eastern Kenya near Nkubu town. He has been farming for the last two years with only one employee. His main produce has been bananas, but in the last two years he decided to venture into poultry farming. He sells his bananas to the local market.

His future ambition is to sell his animals in the adjacent countries, such as C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and earn a much higher profit.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":529149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"N'Tjinina kololndi\u00e8ba","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-25T16:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moussa  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":102119.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961444,"comment":null},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":102119.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913456,"comment":null},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":102119.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476597,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-29T01:08:28Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":195477,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more used bed sheets to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":20,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":80000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":195478,"name":"Rono","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rono K. is a 23 year old farmer, who lives near Litein in the South Rift Valley of Kenya.

She began her small business with her own money that she received from her husband.  Her starting capital was $50.  Her business was to sell boards along the Katindo road at Afia Bora. She has been selling lumber for 12 years.  Before settling in the town of Goma, Mangaza K. sold beer in Kalehe, a village located in the south of Kivu, 180 km from the town of Goma. \r\n\r\nWith her loan from the IMF Hekima, Riziki Chahi hopes to increase her turnover by buying 50 boards at $250.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to change to general commerce, given the fact that public environmental and conservation services have taken measures to control the cutting of wood and imposed high taxes to discourage destruction of the environment. \r\n\r\nMangaza K. prefers to increase her savings through the IMF Hekima.  Her ambition is to join the group which offers more operational advantages than the community bank of which she is a member. In addition, she hopes to do some work to her house to make it more comfortable. \r\nMangaza K. thanks the IMF Hekima for the loans she had received without any material backing because, thanks to these loans, she is able to meet the needs of her children.  \r\n\r\nThe group Neema has 18 members, most of whom are women.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Shannon Arnold, Kiva

Not one to be left out of this lucrative opportunity which had presented itself in her home area of Nyakacwamba, Rukungiri, is A. Molly Adrine, an enterprising and lively 30-year-old woman, who made a decision to capitalize on it.\n\nWith the money Molly had saved working in a local market, she bought her first consignment bales of secondhand clothes. With these, she took root and, though her business has had its fair share of ups and downs, she has emerged as a resilient woman who has refused to buckle under any sort of pressure. With this kind of spirit, she has made enormous headway as manifested in the 300,000 Ugandan shillings she makes monthly.\n\nMolly is a lady who likes taking the long view and, as such, she has drawn up a plan to expand her secondhand clothes selling business into a wholesale franchise.

She only attended school through the 6th grade but did not continue due to the civil war which at that time affected the schools that she would have attended.  She lives in her own home with her family and also supports her sister who lives in their late parents' home by sending her money and food. \r\n\r\nShe has never lived outside of Boane, she has only moved from her parents' home to her own.  She has had her own business for more than 23 years.  She has 2 employees who help her and she earns around 9.000.00mt per month, which she uses for household expenses.  With the help of her husband's salary, an employee of the Ministry of the Interior, she is able to save a bit in her bank account.  \r\n\r\nShe has never had loans in other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku through neighbors who are also customers.  This is her third loan, in the amount of 20.000.00mt, which she will use to purchase construction materials (sand, cement, iron, iron bars, etc.) to continue making improvements to her home.  The prior loans were for 7.000.00mt and 16.000.00mt for the same purpose. She promises to pay the loan as agreed to have access to others.

He is 22, married, and father to two children aged 5 and 1, who do not yet go to school.  Osvaldo finished twefth grade but did not continue because he was not accepted to University.  He lives in his parents' house with his family and also supports his parents, who live with him.\r\n\r\nHe never left Boane; he grew up and studied always in this District.  For more than four years he has worked for ECMEP, a road and bridge construction company.  He has no employees and has a monthly salary of 4,300 meticais.  He uses the money for household expenses and still manages to save some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nOsvaldo has never had loans from other banks.  He learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers at this institution.  This loan for 21,000 meticais is his fifth.  He plans to buy construction material (sand, cement, iron, beams and other items) to continue construction on his house.  The earlier loans were for 7,200 meticais, 3,200 meticais, 13,000 meticais and 15,000 meticais.  They were used for the house and consumer goods.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay off this loan on time so he can maintain his credit.  In the future he would like to ask for more loans to finish his house and begin a commercial activity to increase his income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

He works as an instructor and has been on the staff of the Ministry of Education for more than 29 years.

He even manages to save about 800 MZN in his bank account.\r\n\r\nPedro Alberto has had loans with the Tchuma credit cooperative, but did not continue with them later on.  He found out about Hluvuku through co-workers who are also clients of this institution.  This is his 1st loan [with Hluvuku], which has a value of 17,000 MZN.  He plans to use it to buy construction material (cement, iron rods, etc.) and to pay for labor in order to finish building his home.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay off the loan on time so he will be able to have access to others.  In the future, he intends to request more loans to build a protection wall and bathrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

She is 33 years old. Evelyn is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Evelyn owns and operates a clothing business venture in the retail sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying shirts, dresses, and other ready-to-wear clothes from the city and peddling it to the local community members in their village. Evelyn has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Evelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as her additional working capital. Evelyn is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase more ready-to-wear clothes to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Evelyn from HSPFI.
