The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.

Inomjon has dedicated much effort to the business of agriculture for 18 years already.  He has 0.8 hectares of land where produces different kinds of vegetables.  He also has a lot of apricot trees on his land. \r\n\r\nHe gets a rich harvest every year from his land.  From the savings of his land he could arrange the weddings of his two children.  He also plants different kinds of feeds for animals such as corn, hay, etc.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Inomjon is asking for a loan of 4000 Somoni ($1200 USD) in order to purchase fuels and lubricants, mineral fertilizer and also saplings for expanding his fruit garden.  Inomjon is very confident that he will be awarded this loan and assures you that the money will be repaid in time with no violations. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 51 years old and lives with his wife and 4 chidlren.  He is a humble farmer dedicated to producing such fruits as apricots, peaches, pears, etc.  He also produces feed for the animals inside his land.  This is why he has to leave early in the morning, and it takes time to go back home too. \r\n\r\nWhen he sees the harvest of his land, it comforts him and wants to harvest even more.  However, in order to do that he needs to invest large amounts of money.  He knows that with a larger harvest, he will have better results, and the fruit has to be of better quality in order to get more income from the sales.  \r\n\r\nAside from cultivating his land, Akbarali is also engaged in livestock.  Currently, he has 8 sheep.  He wants to increase his production and purchase more sheep to breed.  That\u2019s the reason that he applied to IMON International for a loan of 4000 Somoni ($1200 USD) for the term of 10 months. \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others.  \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He wishes everyone in the world who uses Kiva to invest in small businesses like his a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year from his country.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shannon Skoglund, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":245668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Build another brick oven","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Santan\u00ed","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-12-24T17:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leoncio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":363636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":373421.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14860945,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":373421.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20402216,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:46:36Z","rounded_local_amount":373421.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27094269,"comment":null},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":373421.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35987742,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:17:14Z","rounded_local_amount":373421.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44568957,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":373421.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52959311,"comment":null},{"amount":75.01,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":373421.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63176561,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":373421.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602212,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":373421.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038451,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":363636.36,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:55:04Z","rounded_local_amount":373421.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96950921,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":363636.4,"processed_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":373421.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103793121,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-24T20:25:43Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:37:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":81253,"name":"Zakia Hakim Shah Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I am a 46 year old lady and my name is Zakia Bibi.

First I sewed clothes for my neighbors. Than I started making stripes (women use these to tie their hair) and selling them in markets. I collected a good number of customers who love to use my stripes. I found a good institute where my elder son learned electrician skills. Now he is an electrician. The next oldest works in a sweetmeat shop. The others are getting an education in a local school. My stripe-making business is 15-years old.

She has been living in this place for the past 20 years. \r\n\r\nShe is an uneducated lady, but she knows the value of education.  She believes that education gives a person success in every walk of life.  She wasn't able to study due to her house\u2019s poor financial conditions.  \r\n\r\nHer husband's name is G. M., and he is a property dealer by profession.  He has 6 years of experience in this business.  Her family consists of 13 members.  She has five sons and six daughters.  Her first two sons have government jobs.  The younger to them runs a grocery shop.  The other two are enrolled in a local school in her neighborhood.  Her daughters stay at home and make embroidered dresses.  \r\n\r\nAkbar Baji couldn\u2019t give her daughters a good education but she wants to deliver the art of embroidery to them.  Now, her daughters are able to embroider dresses very easily without their mother\u2019s help.  Akbar Baji is pleased to see her daughters accomplish this art.  She got her daughters involved in this work because inflation is increasing rapidly and it is difficult for a person to manage all of the household expenses.  She and her daughters share part of the income with their family members. \r\n\r\nAkbar Baji successfully repaid her three loans from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan).  Now she is applying for a loan to buy groceries to expand her son\u2019s grocery shop. \r\n\r\nShe is a group leader of a few more members of her locality.  Rukhsana Baji wants a loan to buy utensils to resell.  Razia Baji wants a loan to buy electric switches to resell.  Asia Baji wants a loan to buy iron to resell.  Safia Baji wants a loan to buy materials (beads and colored thread) to make embroidery on shoes.\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan.  The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business.  The members mutually guarantee one another's loans.  If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":245681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To

It's because they all live in the same neighborhood that they have the confidence to participate together in a group united by the responsibility that each member demonstrates toward her work. The majority of the partners work selling different types of products, such as clothing, food, handmade pieces of clothing and public transportation.Within the  commercial sector there exists a lot of competition, particularly in supply and demand, since if you do not have quality products to offer the public, you are not competitive, and your earnings decline.

Her husband is a chauffeur.  Maura hopes to get increased financing for her business so that she has more working capital to carry out her plans.  She dreams of the institution growing large enough to overcome the country's poverty.\r\n\r\nShe sells cosmetics as a street vendor, a business she has had for 2 years.  She started it as a neighborhood store and kept that for about 2 years.  But because Maura is a hospital nurse and the store was her second source of income, she could not maintain it because she was tired after work.  She decided to sell cosmetics, and with this business she finds the means to meet her obligations.  This loan is for working capital so she can buy products from various merchants.

She is also a farmer who owns 0.5 hectare where she cultivates rice. She can earn only a little revenue from rice because her plot of land is small. In order to expand her rice revenue, Mrs. Nan T. decided to ask for a loan to add to her savings to buy another piece of land on which to cultivate rice. Her husband, Mr. Kem Samart, is a fisherman who catches fish to support the family. \r\n\r\nAll the members in this village bank loan will receive end-of-term loans, so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. These loans allow borrowers to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Her husband, Mr. Seng S., is a construction worker who makes a small income to support the family. Although they try to work hard, they don't earn enough income to provide better living conditions for their family. In order to improve their standard of living, Mrs. Soleng H. decided to ask for a loan, to add to her savings, to build a new house for her family. Mrs. Soleng H. is 30 years old and the mother of three children who all attend the local school. \r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Twelve members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Mrs. Chanthol K. is the village bank (loan group) president who has been selected by the members. She is a farmer who owns 1.5 hectares to cultivate rice to earn a living. Because it is now rice harvesting seaS., she needs to hire laborers to harvest her rice for revenue. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to hire laborers for this purpose. Her husband, Mr. Chum Sem, is a driver who drives a dump truck for a salary. Mrs. Chanthol K. is 50 years old and the mother of four children, two of whom help her on the plantation while the remaining two are attending the local school. Group member Mrs.Khy C. did not come to take her loan, but her husband did; so he is presented in the picture instead of her.<P>\r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Five members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK (Kiva's Field Partner) has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and a default rate of 0% on

Mrs. Thouk K. is the village bank president who has been selected by the members. She owns a small grocery store in the local village. Since this business is going well, she wants to expand it, so she decided to ask for a loan to buy more grocery products for her inventory. She hopes to increase her income with this new loan. Mrs. Thouk K. is a 54-year-old widow with a child who is employed in a garment factory. <p>\r\n\r\nMr. Tha C. did not come to take the loan but his wife did, so she is presented in the picture instead him.<p>\r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan including end-of-term loans. Six members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal O. the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. These allow tH. to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term.

She is a farmer who owns 1.5 hectares where she cultivates rice. In this plantation, she now faces a problem because her field is infertile, which has a bad effect on her crop. In order to deal with this problem, Mrs. Phin C. decided to ask for a loan to buy more fertilizers to support the field and make her crop more productive. Mrs. Phin C. is a 30-year-old widow with three children, one of whom is attending the local school while the remaining two are too young to work or study. \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Phin C. will share this loan with the other village bank members, who will use it for a variety of purposes.\r\n<p>\r\nAll the members in this village bank are seeking end-of-term loans, so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. The End-of-term (EoT) loan is AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able.

Her perseverance has given her family the assurance that she does everything possible to make their lives pleasant.<P>\r\n\r\nThanks to the hard work she invests in agriculture, she was able to purchase a small plot of land that she is farming together with her husband. However, the produce has decreased and the family expenses are using up the little capital they have. In turn, this has reduced the amount of money available for purchasing fuels and lubricants, seeds and fertilizer for the new plot of land they have invested in. That is the reason that Malika is requesting a loan of 3000 Somoni (900 USD) for a term of 9 months.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

","en":"Hadicha A. is a 20-year-old woman and married.  After finishing school, she took a sewing course and became a dressmaker.  Now she does custom, bespoke work out of her home.  Her husband is in the business of fattening and selling cattle.  Hadicha would like to take out a loan towards the purchase of several rams for her husband.  She explains that her husband would never have come to MicroInvest, so she took it upon herself to assist him with this. Since the price of cattle in the marketplace is currently low, she would like to increase her husband's herd. In her free time, Hadicha helps her husband to feed the cattle.  She lives in the remote village of Kashka in the Garfurov region.

She sells firewood. Her husband, Mr. Lum Thol, is a farmer who owns a plot of land where he cultivates rice. Even though they work hard, they still earn less income than they need to provide a better life for their family. In order to improve their living conditions, Mrs. Tren C. decided to ask for a loan to add to her savings to build a new house. She is 35 years old and the mother of three children, two of whom attend the local school and the third is still too young to go school. One member of the group, Vy S., was not available for the photo, so her husband is in the photo.\r\n\r\nOne member of this group has an end-of-term loan and the rest have monthly payment loans. The end-of-term loan client is not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Thanks to his abilities he was able to buy his own house, and now he lives with his wife, who works in a local confectionery plant. They have two children. Islom dreams of building his own workshop, so as to be independent and earn more. Now he requests 2500 Somoni ($750) for a term of 12 months.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Inomjon leases farming land for seasons, therefore he cultivates his crops and then sells them, but his profits decrease due to the land payments. Therefore, Inomjon wishes to quickly acquire his own land, where he can sow his crops and improve his revenue. To make that a reality, he needs to increase his production, and especially the quality of his products to make them more profitable in the marketplace. This will bring better profits and then he will be able to acquire a plot of land. The loan required by Inomjon will be used for the purchase of fuels and lubricants, seeds and mineral fertilizer. We hope that you will be of great help to this hardworking father.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

In order to do this, he needs a larger quantity of fertilizers so that his crops can develop adequately. He hopes to grow high quality crops so that he can sell them for a better price in the markets. For this reason, Ochilboy is asking for a loan to increase his production and improve his products, the sales from which will fund the planting of a new cycle of crops.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 59 years old and he started his business in 1985 during a time when Ciudad del Este was flourishing. But today his sales have lowered, yet he continues in his business thanks to his character and jovial spirit. He has many customers, but he needs an injection of capital in order to buy large quantities giblets and organ meat and purchase them in advance because this is the only way to get an inexpensive price and assure payment a day prior to delivery. Giblets and organ meat are the internal parts of beef, pork, chicken, and are frequently consumed in our country. Among them are liver which is commonly eaten as liver and onions with rice, and also we eat kidney, chicken heart, intestine, etc.\r\n\r\nHe wishes to continue improving his business in order to

The group consists of 13 members, two of which are men and the rest are hardworking and enterprising women, thus the name of the group. The members are people of humble means, but with a great desire to make progress by working in sales of products such as food, watches, clothing, shoes, fruits, backpacks, and embroidered shawls. There is a lot of competition in the market, but they benefit from their experience and the quickness with which they change their merchandise. They are always prepared to deal with the behavior of the market and are prepared for the season. Unfortunately, however, some of the members are not able to enter into this new loan cycle, and this is the main reason for not complying with their payment plan. However, the other members of the group are always there to help them out and to avoid losing members of the group, which is mostly composed of friends of many years. The use of the loan is to purchase merchandise and ingredients in order to meet the demand of the market. The members have experience in loan groups, so they understand the method of payment and the level of responsibility and follow-through that is required to maintain themselves as a group with Fundaci\u00f3n Capital.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

The members are hardworking and responsible people.  In general they are involved in the sale of merchandise such as clothing, handicrafts, vicuna (an animal related to the llama) blankets, sneakers, groceries, auto parts, and home construction.  Within any market there always exists the competition of supply and demand, and these women have learned to deal with it by rotating their merchandise in order to place on sale the items of the season.  Some of them are not able to do it on time and are left with items that are out-of-season and difficult to sell to demanding customers.  It is for this reason that sometimes the members are late with their payments.  The purpose of the loan is to increase merchandise for the Christmas season during which there is a greater demand for their products as well as for the purchase of work tools for the men.  Their experience within the realm of solidarity groups is good since some of the members of this group participated in other loans with other groups and were able to pay punctually.  There exists a family kinship within this group between Marisol and Gonzalo who are brother and sister but they have totally independent incomes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristy

From a tender age, she began all sorts of businesses, but finally decided to specialize in the buying and selling of Soumbala (a natural seasoning of multiple virtues made from the African locust nut) which she learned early on from her grandmother (as do most women of her ethnicity: the Minianka). She has been selling out of her home for 20 years. To secure complementary financial resources, she has turned to microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso for the last 4 years. After having properly repaid her previous loans (3 group loans and 2 individual loans), she is on her third individual loan. Mrs. Nanou plans to buy with this loan 40 baskets of semi-transformed Soumbala in Koutiala at the weekly fairs from women coming from the villages. Afterwards, she fully transforms it in her way to make it more presentable with several employees. She sells her goods in the city of Bamako (capital of Mali) and Koutiala to a female clientele for cash or credit. She hopes to make a monthly profit of 140,000 CFA francs, which she plans to use to repay the loan and take care of her children.

His business is located in Malpaisillo, at the following address: Four blocks south of the Petronic 4 gas station. He has had this business for 15 years. He began the business by buying pig heads, since his father also worked in pork butchering, and he decided to become independent by establishing his own business, which has provided him with plenty of customers, which motivates him to continue with his business. He needs working capital to buy pork because he has to go to different regions to buy the pigs that are most economically favorable for him. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":247168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-12-27T00:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eddy Pantaleon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1361.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858702,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1361.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399957,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1361.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091943,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1361.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985335,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-27T08:31:35Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":81561,"name":"Oscar Ruperto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nEn el municipio de El Viejo de la ciudad de Chinandega, el se\u00f1or Oscar Ruperto M. se dedica a su actividad de agricultura dedic\u00e1ndose al cultivo de pl\u00e1tanos los cuales son vendidos en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n en el municipio de El Viejo siendo visitado por varios clientes que le compran los pl\u00e1tanos y en ocasiones hasta clientes que no son del municipio.\n\nCeprodel le ha apoyado grandemente porque le ha beneficiado con cr\u00e9ditos que los ha utilizado en la compra de insumos para la ganader\u00eda y hoy en d\u00eda solicita un nuevo cr\u00e9dito para la compra de una bomba para riego de la siembra.

Nazokat is 35 years old. She is married with three children. Nazokat has a tailoring business at her home. Her business is sewing a national raincoat called \u201cChapan\u201d for men and women. Her workmanship is very good and she has a good eye for design. She is very organized and has a good head for business. \r\n<p>\r\nNazokat has had this business for 10 years and this is her fifth loan from IMON International. With her loan, she will buy more fabric and embroidery materials. She smiles when asked what her dreams are for the future. She quickly replies that she plans to open a workshop, hire seamstresses, and expand her business. With her spirit, she will surely succeed.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today it remains a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She realized she needed to start a business so she could earn money to take care of her child. After attending training in tailoring, she opened a workshop in her house. However, she had difficulties because she did not have enough capital to invest. One of her friend advised her to apply for a loan to IMON International. Since then (2005) she has applied for two loans from IMON International and repaid both of her loans successfully. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of  2500 Somoni ($750 USD), she plans to sew and sell the national raincoat (called \u201cChapan\u201d) for men and women. She will use the profits to pay school fees for her daughter and to slightly remodel her house. Gulbeka plans to repay her loan in 12 months. Let\u2019s help this mother to keep working for the well-being of her daughter and household.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today it remains a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and an outpost of Alexander the Great's domain. From this region sprang great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex amalgam of Islamic, Soviet, and modern Western influences as well as Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan's independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural and manufacturing sectors, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and an outpost of Alexander the Great's domain. From this region sprang great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex amalgam of Islamic, Soviet, and modern Western influences as well as Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan's independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.
