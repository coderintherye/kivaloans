She began selling shoes, but later added products through catalogs.  As a result, she built up her own capital which she used to increase her sales.

Her main suppliers are the warehouses in the central part of the city and the specialty catalogs that frequently advertise good promotional offers.  Her business is managed by her uncle since she works at a part-time job in the mornings to earn income.  In the afternoons, Yolbin takes over her business.  Competition is high, but there is much public demand to generate income for all the businesses.  Her greatest challenge is the lack of operating capital that would enable her to respond quickly to her customers.

Pedro bought cookware, eight sets of tables and chairs, a freezer, and a stove to furnish a rental location where he is able to carry out his work.

Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He always dreamed to have his own land and a lot of cattle to create his own farm. For more than seven years he has been in this business and tries to expand it. He is married and is a loving father of five children. The income which he receives from the business is spent on the needs of his family and expansion of the business. Abduahad wants to receive a loan in the amount of $3000USD to buy cattle, mineral fertilizer and fuel and lubricants.

is a 41-year-old married woman. She has 5 children with ages ranging from 9 to 20. She considers herself to be a quiet woman. \r\n\r\nShe operates a salon where she provides hairdressing, blow drying, and plaiting services to women. She has been in this business for three years and employs one staff member. She describes her biggest business challenges to be lack of capital to buy extra blow-drying machines, and frequent power shortages.\r\n\r\nShe will use her Kes 10,000 loan to purchase an extra blow-drying machine.

Evangelista is a single mother and her home is a simple structure that she shares with her three children. Her most difficult challenge is to begin her new cafeteria business. Evangelista says that her business efforts will make it possible to provide for her family. In the meantime, she plans to continue to enjoy attending and participating in church and doing business.\r\n\r\nEvangelista will use her portion of this group loan to invest in her butcher shop and she is planning to buy a cow to butcher and sell. She also sells boiled beans that neighborhood people buy to cook them faster at home. She began her business by selling these boiled beans and after she saved enough money she began buying meat such as chicken, beef, and pork, to start a butcher shop.

She lives with her partner Julian who is 29 years old and Ezequiel, their school-aged child who is 5 years old. They live in the town of Sirenachayocc where they have their own house. What they most want is to provide their son with a comfortable environment. Sarita emphasizes that everything she obtains is through her tenacity and devotion to her cocoa, coffee and sesame crops. It is for this reason that she tries to give her crops the best possible care and under this premise many of her buyers have been satisfied by the quality of her agricultural products. Nevertheless, she strives to do her best every day and devotes a good amount of time to her crops. She does this with the help of her partner. However, at harvest time she has to hire labourers to speed up the harvesting process in their daily efforts to obtain a good income. With the requested loan, Sarita will buy more cocoa plants and hopes to graft them as they grow. Her future plan is to invest her income in other businesses such as guinea pig breeding. This will be her first loan and she is very happy to know that she will have financial support. She is willing to comply promptly with her repayment schedule. With the loan she will acquire cocoa plants to expand her crops and obtain higher revenues later.\n\n.\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":612.15,"image":{"id":865734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cocoa plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250.2},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":266.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":272.45},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":284.94},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":292.62},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":303.21},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":317.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":325.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":338.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":349.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.57},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.89},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.48},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.36},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.41},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":93.29,"local_amount":254.44,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":254.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851287,"comment":null},{"amount":96.02,"local_amount":261.85,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":261.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666470,"comment":null},{"amount":101.45,"local_amount":276.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":276.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621623,"comment":null},{"amount":102.92,"local_amount":280.72,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":280.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835705,"comment":null},{"amount":107.3,"local_amount":292.62,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":292.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245466,"comment":null},{"amount":111.17,"local_amount":303.21,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":303.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385514,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T21:11:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333959,"name":"Philippe","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Philippe est un homme \u00e2g\u00e9 de 32 ans.

She has been working providing services, specifically hair-dressing, for the last 30 years.  Bernardita started as an assistant in a beauty salon, and then 11 years ago become independent.  She now has her own premises, which are leased and located 15 minutes from her home.  She comments that it is going very well for her, in spite of the competition in the area where she lives.\r\n\r\nHer work schedule is every day of the week, from 11 in the morning until 11 at night.  Her only days off are Mondays.  She purchases her supplies from commercial premises and distributors who solely sell cosmetology and hair products.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will purchase a vaporizer (for use after massages and hair coloring), and sculpting scissors (scissors for thinning out the hair).\r\n\r\nHer goals for her business are to expand and remodel her hair salon.  Additionally, she would like to buy new products to introduce more services, such as waxing (a bed and wax melter).\r\n\r\nBernardita lives with her 19-year-old son, who is studying for a degree as a dental technician.  Her dreams on a personal level are to acquire her own home; she has applied for a housing subsidy, as she is also a member of a housing committee.\r\n\r\nFondo Esperanza has been a great help for her business, especially when needing to invest in new products that she would not be able to afford on her own.  This is why Bernadita is very grateful for the services offered by the institution.\r\n\r\nThe interpersonal relationships between the group of the Communal Bank are very good, as they have respect, commitment and trust.\r\n\r\nPudahuel is a community in the western part of Santiago (the capital of Chile), in the metropolitan region.  The name is from Mapundungun (the Mapuche language), and translates as \"the place where the waters meet\", or \"the place of the pools\", due to its wide river network composed of the Mapocho river and the Lampa, Car\u00e9n and Las Cruces estuaries.  This favors the soil for agricultural production due to the existence of abundant water underground."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":865532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to purchase a vaporizer (for use after massages and hair coloring), and sculpting scissors (scissors for thinning out the hair)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Pudahuel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-09-14T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernardita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":264529,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":14035},{"due_date":"2011-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":15613},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":15762},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":15912},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":16064},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":16218},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":16372},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":16529},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":16687},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":16846},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":16864},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":17288},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":17333},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17499},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":17666},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":17841}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.51},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.94},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.26},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.58},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.27},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.62},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.4},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":203.46,"local_amount":93604,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:00:03Z","rounded_local_amount":93624.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232795997,"comment":null},{"amount":144.41,"local_amount":66434,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":66448.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238606918,"comment":null},{"amount":188.35,"local_amount":86650,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":86668.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244561286,"comment":null},{"amount":38.78,"local_amount":17841,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":17844.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250772281,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-15T12:00:21Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":333973,"name":"Manuel De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Manuel Jes\u00fas tiene 74 a\u00f1os, su actividad es la venta de ropa.

They live together in their own home which is located in the town of Santa Rosa.\r\n\r\nEven when she was a teenager, Aydee worked on her parents' land and also worked as a laborer on different farms.  With some savings that she had made, she bought her own plot of land and she has been working on this land for almost five years.  She has 3 hectares of land where she grows cacao and coffee.  The key to her success lies in her creativity and her desire to work.  She applies modern technology to her work with her plants because she receives periodic training from agricultural engineers.  Her most sought-after product is coffee beans because of the quality of the product that she sells.  As a result, she makes good money.  She normally works alone but at harvest times she hires laborers so that she can pick and sort her crops more quickly.  Aydee's future plan is to continue expanding her production so that she can continue satisfying her customers and improving her own living conditions.\r\n\r\nThis will be Aydee's second loan from MFP.  She knows that the loan money will be very useful to her in making progress in her work.  For this reason, she is once again very grateful to you all for your support.

Es un vocablo del mapudungun (lengua mapuche) que se traduce como \u201clugar donde se juntan las aguas\u201d o \u201clugar de charcos\u201d, debido a que posee una variada red fluvial compuesta por el r\u00edo Mapocho y los esteros Lampa, Car\u00e9n y Las Cruces, lo que favorece sus suelos para la producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola por la existencia de abundante agua subterr\u00e1nea.\n","en":"Margarita is part of the communal  bank \"Amaican\" in Pudahuel, in the city of Santiago. She sews clothing for the home, such as tablecloths and curtains. She makes a certain amount of clothing, stores them in individual bags and then travels around the area where she lives to sell what she has made. To her older clients she offers credit facilities. Her workshop is located in her own home where she has worked for the last 13 years. Margarita says that before becoming a seamstress, she was a cooking teacher at a food store. However, due to health reasons she had to change direction. However she was operated on 2 years ago and now only has to undergo treatment and checkups. She works Monday through Friday in the afternoons and spends her weekends selling her products.  \r\n\r\nShe buys her consumables in the town of Independencia as the prices are inexpensive. With the loan she will buy an overlock sewing machine and fabric with which to run her sewing business. The remainder of the loan she will use to buy paraffin as she will make the most of the winter season to sell. \r\n\r\nHer business goal is to set up her business in a permanent location to offer and sell her sewing products. This would give her great peace of mind and be good for her health. Margarita lives with her son who is 28 years old and depends on others for work. Her dreams at a personal level are to rebuild her home with solid materials to keep them warm during the winter. Her house is located on a piece of land that was given to her. Another of her dreams is to help the less fortunate on a voluntary basis: she already prepares lunches at an open house for the aged. \r\n\r\nMargarita is very happy and thankful for the loans and services provided by Fondo Esperanza. Thanks to the training sessions given at the meetings of the communal bank group she has been better able to organize and administer her business.

She then heads calmly towards her farm together with her partner.  Mariluz grows cacao, coffee and a range of citrus fruits.  These are important products that help her to get ahead and cover the education expenses of her beloved children.  With the profits that she made  from selling her crops, Mariluz set up a grocery store where she serves on weekends.  It is doing very well.  She mentions that during harvest seasons and weeding time she must hire laborers so that she can carry out the work that needs to be done more quickly.  Her neighbors suggested that she approach MFP to request a loan as our institution provides loans to those who are most in need and who want to invest money.\r\n\r\nWith the help of all of you, Mariluz hopes to carry out her plans.  In the future, she plans to buy more land so that she can continue farming.  This is her first loan and she hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can buy the products she needs such as manure.  For her part, she pledges to make her repayments on time as she would like to be able to access further loans in the future.  She will use her 3,000 soles to buy sacks of manure which will help her to improve her plants."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":493.1,"image":{"id":865860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sacks of manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariluz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":209.49},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":213.26},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":217.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":228.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":233.8},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":242.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":254.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":260.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":271.03},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":278.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":290.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":299.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.81},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.2},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.81},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.73},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.49},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.38},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.1},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.69},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":76.81,"local_amount":209.49,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":209.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851294,"comment":null},{"amount":78.2,"local_amount":213.26,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":213.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666478,"comment":null},{"amount":79.81,"local_amount":217.66,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":217.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621630,"comment":null},{"amount":84.12,"local_amount":229.43,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":229.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835712,"comment":null},{"amount":85.33,"local_amount":232.71,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":232.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245474,"comment":null},{"amount":88.83,"local_amount":242.27,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":242.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385520,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-13T17:41:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":334003,"name":"Mujeres Buscando Un Futuro Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene una vitrina donD. exhibe  lo que venD., tanto sus productos D. belleza como algunas golosinas como galletas, gaseosas, chocolates etc. este negocio lo tiene en su misma casa permiti\u00e9ndole estar cerca D. sus hijos,  con los ingresos que obtiene D. su trabajo apoya a su hija que estudia enfermer\u00eda por lo menos para su movilidad y algunos materiales indispensables para su carrera, pertenecer al grupo \u201cMUJERES BUSCANDO UN FUTURO\u201d  le permite tener sentido del ahorro y el progreso, debido a ello es que ha salido adelante logrando mantener su negocio tanto que ahora con su pr\u00e9stamo esta pr\u00f3xima a comprar una vitrina mas granD. que le permitir\u00e1 tener mas productos y ventas  en el futuro ya esta viendo la posibilidad D. poner una bodega  en su casa cuenta con el lugar solo le faltar\u00eda acondicionarlo para empezar.\n\n* Mar\u00eda es la ultima D. la fila esta con chompa negra.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda has a display case for her products.

He is married to Eugenia, 37, and they have 2 sons and live in their own house, constructed of rustic wood material with a corrugated iron roof.\r\n\r\nOscar, with great care, succeeded in taking up green farming. He works surrounded by luxuriant trees at the same time as he cultivates his own cacao, coffee and timber trees, work he has been doing for 15 years. He mentioned that when he was a young child he learned how to till the soil thanks to instruction from his parents. His most profitable product is the sale of coffee because he sells it in a large quantity and at a good price.

are many Cambodians who make a living as rice cultivators. One of them is Mr. Ka, who has been working in this sector since 2005. He and his wife grow rice on their own farmland that they inherited from their grandparents. They have four children. Two of the children are married and live independently, and the other two are living with him.\r\n\r\nFrom this business, Ka earns about $3 each day.

She, together with her husband and children, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, Victoria is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVictoria operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 13,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVictoria hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
