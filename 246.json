The loan will be used to buy more popsicles, ice cream, fruit drinks and juices etc. so that she can continue growing her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":353772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"increase her stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-18T16:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":76.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":77.48},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":81.26},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":84.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":88.37},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":92.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.69},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.69,"local_amount":76.25,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":81.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212020,"comment":null},{"amount":27.12,"local_amount":77.48,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":82.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641555,"comment":null},{"amount":28.44,"local_amount":81.26,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":86.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080995,"comment":null},{"amount":29.62,"local_amount":84.62,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":90.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997134,"comment":null},{"amount":30.93,"local_amount":88.37,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":94.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842490,"comment":null},{"amount":32.2,"local_amount":92.02,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":98.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734068,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-18T16:58:32Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":122740,"name":"Jamileth Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jamileth, de 33 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera, tiene una ni\u00f1a de 3 a\u00f1os de edad, trabaja como secretaria de actuaciones en el poder judicial de Juigalpa desde hace 9 a\u00f1os, esta solicitando su primer credito a esta institucion para poder realizar mejoras a su vivienda, como es ponerle el cielo razo, ya que en el invierno aparecen muchos insectos que pueden ser perjudiciales para su peque\u00f1a hija, ademas desea comprar e instalar una puerta de mejor calidad que le brinda seguridad a su casa, ya que la que actualmente tiene se esta deteriorando.

E. \r\n\r\nMy family and I had to leave the town where we lived, San Sami\u00e1n \u2013 Huarochir\u00ed.  We had to go to Lima due to a work proposal my husband received.  Unfortunately, he suffered an accident in transit.  He could not keep working as a bricklayer for one year.  \r\n\r\nAt the root of this situation, I see myself in the necessity of working for my family.  I had to go up and down the streets with my two small children knocking door to door selling food and fruit.  I also washed clothes and helped cook in popular dining rooms to survive and not leave my family abandoned.  Even so, these earnings did not cover the expenses that we had.  \r\n\r\nI soon came to learn from a nephew who participates in EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD about the loans they give to people like me, entrepreneurs.  I realized that this was the opportunity that I was looking for to progress economically.  That is how I became part of the Luz D. San Antonio Community Bank.  I am currently the president.  Thirteen people participate.  We work in businesses.\r\n\r\nWith my first loan that I got from EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD, I could buy merchandise like flowers, medicinal plants, and natural medicines.

P. decided to work so she could help her husband.  He did not like the idea at first, but in time began to support her.  This is how she got started as an assistant in a high school kiosk.

At first, she was not earning much but then she began to get some customers and the orders kept coming in.  This is when she realized that she needed more capital than she had in order to serve her customers, which is why she decided to take out a loan with \u201cEDAPROSPO \u2013 PROSPERIDAD\u201d and become a member of the communal bank \u201cSanta Rosa D.

A. lives in the village of Dinas, Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental. She is 33 years old, married, and makes a living running a small retail store. This is a new business, and her main source of income comes from selling clothes and shoes. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rona joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rona has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,000 PHP from GDMPC which she used to to buy additional products to sell. Rona is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which she will use to buy still more products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from this loan to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has applied for a new loan of 2000 PHP to expand her business. This loan will be the first taken out by Nida from GDMPC, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated by the loan to improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI, which she used to expand her store. Now, she has applied for a new loan which she will use to buy additional products to sell.

B., 34, is from the village of Gango, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Pedirama owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products in the local community. Pedirama has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns ~1,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Pedirama joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Pedirama has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Pedirama is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP as business capital. This will be her fourth loan taken from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":350624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Lorna has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn April 2009, Lorna joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lorna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI. Lorna is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.

O. is from the village of Upper Langcangan, Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental. She is 28 years old. Christy is married and has an infant child. To make a living, Christy owns a business venture operating transportation services. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing tricycle rentals to the local community. Christy has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (approximately $62) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Christy joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Christy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Christy is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to repair an existing vehicle for better service. This will be the second loan taken out by Christy from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing new clothing to local community members. Nenita has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos (about $83) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nenita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Nenita is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Nenita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Erlinda joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. She is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling high demand products in the local community. Mila has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Mila joined as Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. She is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be to purchase additional goods for sale in her store.  A portion of her loan will also be used to repair her house. This loan will be her fourth from HSPFI. \n\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has five children: four daughters and one son. Even though one of her daughters is married and her son has gone to Moscow to work, after having reached the age of forty-seven, she still has to look after her other three daughters, the smallest of whom is just four years old. For the sake of that she is engaged in stock-raising. \r\n\r\nMainly, Gulzhan purchases calves and feeds and resells them. Her husband helps her after work. She started this business twenty-five years ago with just eight dollars. Now her monthly income is 150 dollars!\r\n\r\n\u201cCattle-breeding is not the most profitable business. It is not sitting in a clean office gazing into a monitor, doing accounts. Anyway by raising cattle, we\u2019ve been able to buy a house, furniture, home equipment and even pay for the marriage of our eldest daughter,\u201d says Gulzhan proudly. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Gulzhan needs a loan to increase her livestock population, fatten it up and resell it. In the near future she is going to have a new shed built and a hay-loft, as well as finishing the building of her house, buy her son a car and pay for another daughter\u2019s wedding. \r\n\r\nGulzhan has four partners: Nurzada, Baktijar, Dilbar and Dzhanatkul. Dzhanatkul works as a cook at a school lunch room. The rest are occupied with cattle-breeding. All the members need loans mainly to purchase more livestock, so that they can resell it later.\r\n\r\nNurzada inherited four sheep and one cow. Now she has ten sheep and two cows. She wants a shed to store fodder, after buying a car to get married.\r\n\r\nBaktijar started with buying sheep. Then he bought horned cattle. For the moment he has sheep, oxen and a horse.\r\n\r\nDilbar and her husband used to save money to buy cattle. Now the\u0443 have a cow, a calf and sheep. She wants to buy a car and pay for her son\u2019s marriage.\r\n\r\nYears ago Dzhanatkul bought a cow which provided seven liters of milk a day.

Th\u1ecb (12) is a 37-year-old woman living in the town of Thanh H\u00f3a.  H\u1eb1ng is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 030 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng (18.05.030).\r\n<P>\r\nH\u1eb1ng is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To making a living, H\u1eb1ng owns & operates a business making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes  from selling Ban Cuon (Vietnamese breakfast rolls made of rice noodles) in the local community.  H\u1eb1ng has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 1,200,000 Vietnamese dong (about $68 US) a month from these activities.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2004, H\u1eb1ng joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H\u1eb1ng has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 dong from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 dong which will be used to invest in renovating the business.  The loan will be the 9th loan she has taken out from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  H\u1eb1ng plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<P>\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n<P>\r\n1.  N.

Jypar has one son and one daughter. Both of her children go to college and don\u2019t work. At the age of 49, she works as a commander of the guard. She used to run a little farm. About a year ago she sold one calf and started selling summer hats. To spend $350 at once was a large sum for her, but she overcame her doubts and invested in hats. As a result, she earned around $200 and this allows her to pay for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nJypar has a desire to expand her business and to do that she needs a loan. With half of the loan she wants to buy men\u2019s and women\u2019s hats, and with the other half she wants to purchase children\u2019s Panama hats. She plans to get a container and achieve $1,200 turnover. As her children grow, so do her expenses for their education. Owning and running her own container would let her meet her growing needs. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Guljamal, Jailobai and Tojihon. Guljamal is 42. She has been selling women\u2019s clothes and has raised six children. Her spouse works as an unskilled laborer. Guljamal needs a loan to make a repair at her house, since summer is the best time to do this.\r\n\r\nJailobai, 38, is married. He is occupied with selling cosmetics, household goods, detergents and women\u2019s hygienic cleansers. Four years ago he obtained a loan and started his business. So far he has bought a house and livestock. Now he needs another loan to buy different brands of detergents.\r\n\r\nTojihon is 29. Together with her husband, she sells men\u2019s clothing, pants and jogging trousers. After nine years of hard work, they were able to buy a house. They want to purchase more items of clothing to attract more customers and eventually increase family income, since they intend to save funds for their sole daughter\u2019s education.  But to do that they need to obtain a loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept:  People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Zulmat is 51 years old. She is married and the loving mother of 4 children. In order to help the husband to support the large family, Zulmat started her own business. So for the last 13 years Zulmat has been selling curtains. She has her own trading place in one of the local markets. A very friendly and polite person by nature, Zulmat obtained her clientele very quickly. The business is stable and generates the main income for the family. \r\n\r\n<P>Today, Zulmat is planning to increase her working capital in order to expand her business. She needs additional funds to purchase new curtains to sell. Thus, Zulmat is requesting a loan of 5000 Somoni. Zulmat had taken loans from IMON several times before and has proved herself to be a reliable client. She thanks all for their support and promises to be accurate in her loan payments.<\/P> \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mislima is 45 year old. She is married and has two chidlren. She owns a specialized fabrics store at the central market in Dushanbe town. Mislima works in a sphere of trade where the demand is always very consistent and high, because the national dresses in Tajikistan are very popular and very important item of the dowry of any girl. She is one of the leading fabric vendors in the market where she works. She is very tenacious and determined in all of her business endeavors, which has helped to sustain her venture for 11 years. Mislima is a skilled entrepreneur. When she started this trade, she decided to implement basic concepts of integrity and hard work in her business to reach ultimate success. This laid a firm foundation for winning results and Mislima has obviously been a successful small entrepreneur. However, she doesn\u2019t want to stop. She would like to continue seeing her venture grow. Today she is requesting a loan of 4000 Somoni to increase her assorted inventory.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Over time she has gotten to know the preferences and tastes of her customers, making her place a popular stop when they visit the market. \r\n\r\nTo meet growing demand from her customers, Muhabat is requesting a loan for 5000 Somoni, which will allow her to purchase more fabrics at wholesale prices. Increased selling capacity will not only meet the needs of her clients, but the additional profits generated will meet another of Muhabat\u2019s goals: to help pay for her son\u2019s college tuition.

Anvar is a hard-working entrepreneur from Dushanbe, Tajikistan. He has operated his own car repair business for the past three years. Anvar has extensive experience in this field and his skills are very much in demand. Car ownership is increasing rapidly in Tajikistan, which means more business for repair technicians like Anvar. Anvar works hard to earn a good income and support his family. He and his wife have two children. Anvar has requested a short-term loan of 2000 Somoni to buy some tools that he needs for his business. The income from this loan will help him pay for the schooling expenses for his children. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Alisher is 30 years old. He is married and has two children. He is a hard-working man struggling to feed his children and parents (who are living with him) by selling national fabrics for national dresses. Alisher has a trading place in the center local market of Dushanbe city. All the fabrics are supplied from the neighboring town of Istaravshan. Alisher is trying to have a wide range of goods to meet the requirements of his customers and to satisfy the needs of the clients with different levels of income. Alisher, being a devoted father, is doing all the best in order for his children to be well educated and to make them happy. Today Alisher feels that with more working capital his business could generate more income, so he is asking for a loan of 5000 Somoni to jumpstart the business and raise the family's standard of living. Let's help this incredible father give his children a brighter future.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Hafiza is 44 years old. She is married with 4 children. Hafiza\u2019s husband is retired on a pension and currently unemployed. That is why her business is the main source of income of her family.\r\n\r\n Hafiza has been running her own business for 8 years already. She has a place in the local market selling foodstuffs such as flour, macaroni, rice, sweets, tea and other items. She works from 8:00 a.m. till 5:00 p.m. Her son help her in the store, registering the stock and serving the customers. \r\n\r\nHafiza and her son are very friendly and polite which allows them to have a large clientele.

Hafiza promises to repay her loan on time and thanks everyone who decided to support her.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Firuza is married and has 4 children. She is a hard-working woman who, in order to help her husband cover the household expenses and pay for her children's education, decided to start her own business 2 years ago. <P>\r\n\r\nFiruza started selling blankets and quilts, and later she started selling fabrics for sewing traditional dresses. The response from her customers has been very positive and business has increased. She is currently handling many orders placed by her customers. In order to fill these orders, Firuza is seeking a loan of US$ 500 to buy merchandise. Become an important part of the growth of this business and the lives of Firuza and her family. They will be forever grateful. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has produced potatoes, quinoa, and wheat for 15 years.  She processes the potatoes to dry them and to sell them at a better price.  Her husband is a fundamental part of her work, and she helps him in everything that is necessary.  But during planting and\/or harvest season is when they need more people, so they hire workers, and they have to make a big investment to pay them.  But selling the dried potatoes in the city markets lets them recover their investment.

He lives with his wife and one of his four children who helps him in his business. He has a carpentry shop in his house where he makes furniture in all varieties and styles, however the client likes. He also repairs furniture items that he finds in poor condition, making them look like they just came from the store. His wife and his son assist him in this and they are a great help to him. He has been working in carpentry and cabinetmaking for 15 years. He likes this profession because it allows him to have a tranquil life and to demonstrate his artistry and creativity. On the other hand, he also finds it to be good business; he has many regular clients who trust in his good work. Eventually, Roger would like to be able to export the furniture he makes to other places. This is his 4th loan with MFP and what he likes about working with his communal bank is that everyone is punctual at the meetings and in their payments. With the loan he is requesting, he will buy more wood to continue with the work that he likes so much.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":354260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To buy wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-19T04:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roger","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":381.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":387.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":406.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":423.49},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":442.22},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":458.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.93},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.96},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.2},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125.93,"local_amount":381.62,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":382.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212024,"comment":null},{"amount":127.96,"local_amount":387.75,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":388.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641559,"comment":null},{"amount":134.2,"local_amount":406.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":407.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080999,"comment":null},{"amount":139.75,"local_amount":423.49,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":424.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997149,"comment":null},{"amount":145.93,"local_amount":442.22,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":442.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842494,"comment":null},{"amount":151.23,"local_amount":458.25,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":458.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734072,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-19T12:32:53Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":122999,"name":"Sabrina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sabrina tiene 30 a\u00f1os, es madre de 2 hijos, vive con su pareja, su abuelito y su hermana.

L. (second to the right in the front row) is one of the coordinators for the Bank of Hope Violeta and a budding entrepreneur. She lives about an hour outside the capital, Santo Domingo, and makes a living selling clothes door-to-door. While Tomasa has had this business for six years, it\u2019s grown since she took out her first loan in December 2007. Since then, Tomasa has paid back two loans and is now taking out her third (exactly twice the amount of her first one!) <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest benefits of a micro-loan is that it provides Tomasa with the capital she needs to expand her business. While many clothes vendors must travel to the capital two to four times each month to purchase new merchandise, Tomasa only has to make this trip once monthly. This indicates that she has a stable and steady source of income, which allows her to make larger merchandise investments. Since she does not have to make this trip as frequently, she reduces travel costs and also has more time sell the clothes. Since receiving her first loan, Tomasa has expanded her business to reach 12 rather than 6 communities within her city. While this growth is certainly impressive, Tomasa continues to dream and plan; she eventually hopes to own a store.<P>\r\n\r\nTomasa\u2019s aspirations also reach beyond her business as she has high aspirations for her eight-year-old son. While she wants him to study to become a lawyer, he is not yet convinced and would rather pursue a future as a policeman! <P>\r\n\r\nIn her free time, Tomasa enjoys reading her Bible and learning about beautician practices and computers.<P>\r\n\r\nOn behalf of Tomasa, the Bank of Hope Violeta, and the micro-finance institute Esperanza International, thank you for providing opportunities to those who need it most!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":354287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

C. and his family are originally from Oaxaca. Since childhood he has helped his mother milk cows for the family's business making cheese and cream.\r\n\r\nAfter school, Flavio and his brothers would help his parents sell the cheese at workers' quarters in nearby ranches. In their town there wasn't much opportunity to advance, so Flavio decided to start a new life in Mexico City and launch a business, helping him learn more and gain experience in making and selling cheeses. He dedicated himself to the distribution of his products in the community's street markets. Flavio gets up at 4:00 a.m. to make his cheese, cream and other dairy products to sell daily. Also, once a week he delivers his Oaxacan merchandise: cecina (cured, smoked meat), mole (chili sauce with chocolate and peanuts), chorizo (seasoned pork sausage), totopos (tortilla chips), tlayudas (large, crunchy tortilla topped with refried beans, meat, cheese, and salsa), chocolate, etc. For this he asks his brother who lives in Oaxaca to send him the above-mentioned products. \r\n\r\nTwo years ago he had an accident; a trailer hit him and for a year he was disabled and lost everything because he couldn't work. Now he has re-started his business and thus decided to start a lending group with his wife and mother and request a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad A.C. to be able to buy raw materials (rennet, salt, calcium, titanium preservative, propane, cans) and Oaxacan products.

Though the decision she made then allowed her see the happiness that life can offer, she doesn't like to be dependent on anyone, even on her new partner, Anastacio, who is a brother of her former husband, because she knows that she has children of her own to raise and send to school.<P>\r\n\r\nHer membership in ASHI and the loans she has accessed since she became a member have assisted her in running a  business while Anastacio is a laborer and farmer. He is also very supportive of Zenia and his step-children, as well as their own nine-year-old child. Because of this, Zenia has been performing very well in her repayment, attendance, and business thus making her qualified for a higher loan amount.<P>\r\n\r\nZenia's recently received loan was intended as additional capital for her farming (rice planting) business and hog fattening (backyard pig raising) with pigs to be sold after four months. She will also finance her store to be re-opened. Zenia has to have many business to generate bigger income to send all six of her children to school.

G. is from the village of Puli, Carmen Cagayan De Oro City. She is 49 years old. Ruth is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Ruth owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Ruth has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ruth joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ruth is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Ruth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the needs of her family members as well as the educational needs of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

U. is from the village of Lintugop, Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 42 years old. Melenia is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Melenia owns & operates a nipa (palm) weaving business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from weaving & selling nipa (palm) products to local businesses and community members. Melenia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 6800 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Melenia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Melenia is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offerings. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Melenia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

M. is from the village of Garang, Tangub City. She is 40 years old. Elena is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Elena owns & operates a business raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Elena has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Elena is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizer. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Elena from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her eldest child is in high school while the youngest is five years old. Ma. Shirley and Nestor have been running a buying and selling business for the last five years until the present time. They wish to grow this business to increase their income and so that they will be able to support the education of their children until college. They also wish to acquire their own space in the municipal market where they can display items they sell and gain more customers\/buyers. These dreams however will remain as vision forever if the couple's long time problem which is business capital is not addressed.\r\n<P>\r\nIn July of 2009, Ma. Shirley found the opportunity she and her husband were hoping for for many years. She knew ASHI and she felt that the institution fits her needs by offering a loan that suits to her capacity to pay. \r\n<P>\r\nAs a newly recognized member of ASHI and as a beginner, Ma. Shirley's maximum loan amount is still small. However, if she proves that her capacity to pay a larger loan is increased because she was able to grow her business further after her first loan, she can request bigger loans in future loan cycles.\r\n<P>\r\nMa. Shirley believes that the success of her family lies in the success of her business, and the success of her business lies on loans she can request, therefore she promised to herself and her family that she will use her loan to generate income.

Janeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Five years ago, Janeth began selling fish her husband catches from the ocean. They don't have their own boat for fishing because they can't afford to buy one. However, her husband borrows the fishing boat of their neighbor. During days when their neighbor's fishing boat is not available, Janeth has no fish to sell, hence, fishing and fish-selling don't give them regular income. \r\n\r\nFish is not the most in-demand food of people in Janeth's village, yet it is one of the foods people are buying, more than other kinds of meat. It is so because fish is cheaper and common in their place, which is situated near the ocean. Janeth wishes to have this kind of business as their stable source of income. She wants to purchase their own fishing boat to be managed by her husband, thus making fishing as regular as it can be. \r\n\r\nInitially, Janeth had started her fish-selling business after she became a member of ASHI in June 2009. Since the loan she received is not yet enough to purchase a fishing boat for her husband, she will use it to finance her fish business. With her next loan, plus the savings she could generate out of her newly started business, she will be buying her husband a fishing boat. Janeth's husband is so supportive to all her visions, including her dreams for her children. She is determined to work hard in growing her business so that she can send all of her six children to school until college. By then, she foresees their lives coming out of poverty. \r\n\r\nShe is so thankful that ASHI has the same vision as hers and that she has the opportunity to help herself and her family.

B1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adolof N. is the 46-year-old man who leads a group of 15 farmers - Kuanputun B1 - in Bone Village, Nekamese Sub District \u2013 Kupang District. Bone village has a beautiful view and there are many coconut, banana, and palm trees. This village has not been contaminated by air pollution, so the community can breathe fresh air. Most of community members of this village are originally from Timor and they usually speak Timorese in everyday conversation.<p>\r\n\r\nThe villagers have backgrounds as breeders and farmers, raising cows, goats and pigs and cultivating rice fields, the latter fraught with the challenges posed by inconsistent water supplies and diseases.  These challenges are also faced by Adolof and the other members of Kuanputun B1 Group.<p>\r\n   \r\nAdolof is married and has four children. The children are:\r\n-\tDoni N., a 22-year-old high school graduate now attending the selection process to be in the army.\r\n-\tJackson N.,  a 20-year-old high school still looking for a job and now spending his days helping his parents on the farm.\r\n-\tMelkior N., 16 years old in the third grade of Junior High School\r\n-\tAlwi N., 9 years old in the fourth grade of Elementary School.<p>\r\n\r\nAdolof and his wife are poor farmers but they are really responsible to their children. Even though they only generate a small income from their business, they always support and encourage their children to complete their schooling. For Adolof, education is important for their future.<p>\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty that Adolof faces as a farmer is the availability of public transportation, which only operates three times a week, and the location of the market, which is situated about 37 km from Bone village, so their agricultural products cannot be sold faster. \r\n\r\nAs a father of four children, Adolof wants to improve the living standard of his family, and the cattle-fattening program seems to offer the best prospect for achieving his goal. He is therefore requesting a loan of IDR 3,400,000 to buy young cattle to be fattened over a 12-month period. The other group members of Kuanputun B1 are also requesting the same loan, also hoping to improve their lives \r\n\r\nNote: Martinus was replaced by a family member when the group picture was taken.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":354626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle to be fattened.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bone","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-07-18T00:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adolof","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jakson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Debora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tabita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nahor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yuliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Afliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lodia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nikolas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":50700000,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":4329.39,"local_amount":43900000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-22T09:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":44065248.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124001206,"comment":null},{"amount":335.31,"local_amount":3400000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:24:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3412798.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136755434,"comment":null},{"amount":335.3,"local_amount":3400000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-22T12:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3412798.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182619969,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-22T00:56:05Z","paid_date":"2010-12-22T12:14:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
