Her unique way of waiting on her customers and the care with which she sells her merchandise leaves her very sought after. \r\n\r\nIn addition, she has a small corner store in her house, which makes up part of her secondary income, though a lack of products to offer has kept her from growing her store. Therefore, she needs this loan to buy basic grains, soups, bread, sweets, crackers, cleaning products, oils, and beans so that she can \r\noffer quality merchandise and increase the revenues of her business. \r\n\r\nOne of her ambitions is to establish a better quality site of her own, as she currently sells in the open air with no guarantee of safety.

is 34-year-old Namisa. She is married and has two children, aged 9 and 2 years. She has five additional dependents. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, Namisa established her provisions and drinks business. She began her business because she was receiving a very low income from the hairdressing she was doing, so she decided to create an additional source of income. Working seven days a week and eight hours a day, she earns about 1,000,000 Sierra Leone Leones (Le) every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000.

She is married to Rosendo, a contractor, and is the mother of four children. She, together with her husband and children, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMaria Ligaya is a coconut dealer. She buys coconut from different farmers in nearby provinces and delivers it to her regular customers, the coconut retailers, who sell the coconut per piece or use it in their own business. She also manages a small variety store for added income. She earns a minimum of PHP 2000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional stocks of the coconut needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMaria Ligaya hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes that her children will finish their studies up to college. She also dreams of buying a vehicle to be used in her business.

is 51-year-old Matilda. She is married and has two children age 7 and 18 years. \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Matilda established her cooking condiments business. The business started in a small stall at home, and now has a stall at the central market. \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and nine hours a day, she earns about 1,200,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL.

With this new investment, she thinks she can increase her sales, so that her business will propser and allow her to get a wider variety of products, as well as help her move forward with her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":87.55,"image":{"id":936907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"to buy products such as rice, beans, sugar, oil, eggs, milk, meat and cleaning products to stock her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Granada","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-12-13T22:51:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yamileth Del Socorro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":524.58,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":43.77},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.71},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":43.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":43.71},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":43.71},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":43.71},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":43.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":43.71},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":43.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":43.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.71},{"due_date":"2012-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":43.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.81,"local_amount":43.77,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:47Z","rounded_local_amount":43.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242696,"comment":null},{"amount":43.74,"local_amount":43.71,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":43.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381968,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-30T20:34:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":366918,"name":"Sirush","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sirush works at the local school as a teacher.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan.

Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In 2007, in search of an additional source of income for her family, Ryskul started up her business in cattle breeding. Using a starting sum of 40,000 som (KGS), Ryskul was able to start a farm, which now has two milking cows, two heifers, one horse. It yields around 20,000 som (KGS) a month from selling dairy products and meat. In order to further develop her business, Ryskul turned to the company \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 60,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional cattle.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Isaac will educate his children and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Ngosasia group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":937671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jones","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":42700,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":367104,"name":"Amez","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amez is a 35 year-old married woman with four children between the ages of 12 and 2 years.

After losing her husband during the tragic events in the southern part of the country last year, Gulzara has been raising two children \u2014 two and three years old, respectively \u2014 by herself. Seeking a way to provide for her family, Gulzara, with the support of her father, is starting her own business raising livestock. Utilizing a starting capital of 30,000 som (KGS), Gulzara has managed to earn a profit of 2,000 som (KGS) this month from selling milk. In addition, Gulzara is selling baked goods, such as pastries and cookies, that she makes at home. This also adds a little income to the family budget. \r\n\r\nHoping to further grow her business, Gulzara has asked Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy sheep and dairy cows. In the future, Gulzara plans to expand her business so that she is able to get her children an education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":937682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ala-Buka village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-08T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulzara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-09T06:27:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":367111,"name":"Akech","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akech is a 28-year-old married woman with two children.

Her husband is a fireman. Taking into account her husband's low wages and looking for a supplemental income source for her family, in 2008 Fariza started her own business in livestock husbandry.

In 2012, the members of Wekhaka A group will each plant maize plots between half and one acre of land.\r\nThe photograph shows Prisila with her group members.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":937815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fridah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Janerose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prisila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wycliffe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zilpa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":77000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":367200,"name":"Anonymous Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":662.58,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase clothes and shoes","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":184,"posted_date":"2011-12-13T21:50:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1400,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":214.17},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":220.29},{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":229.36},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":236.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":245.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":254.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":214.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.29},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":236.53},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.11},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":214.17,"local_amount":214.17,"processed_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:52:54Z","rounded_local_amount":214.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250838030,"comment":null},{"amount":220.21,"local_amount":220.21,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":220.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257247995,"comment":null},{"amount":228.2,"local_amount":228.2,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-18T08:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":228.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263909461,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-26T21:36:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":367201,"name":"Korandebe\/gtng Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ramadhan fait partie du groupe Korandebe\/Gtng.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Selina will educate her children and repay her loans.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Weuya W group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nThe photograph shows Selina with her group members."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":937836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everlyne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fostine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geofrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronicah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":81900,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
