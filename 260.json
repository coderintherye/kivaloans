M. is from the village of Manuyog, Sagay Camiguin. She is 57 years old, and is married with three adult children. To make a living, Josifina owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Josifina has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Josifina joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Josifina is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her third from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Firuza is a widow and mother of two children. For more than five years, she has worked on the land, cultivating different kinds of crops. She has formed her own businesses depending on the circumstances and the demands of the community. \r\n<p>\r\nWith her earnings, Firuza has been able to provide food for her children and send them to school. They are now grown and have become productive members of the community. Firuza feels happy that she has completed her work as a mother, although this job truly never ends because she will always be concerned for their wellbeing. What Firuza urgently needs right now are fertilizers and other chemicals for cultivating her land. Firuza doesn\u2019t just need good land; she also needs a friendly hand to help her out.   \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of its people are still living in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Since she was younger, Delia has worked hard to provide for the welfare of her family.  Now that she is a widow, she has invested a lot more effort into her business.  She operates a grocery store out of her home.  Thanks to her business, she experiences financial security and peace of mind.  By taking advantage of microloans throughout the years, Delia was able to buy a motorcar and provide a work for her eldest son.  He graduated from high school, but was not able to find a job, so he chose to help his mother in this capacity.  He now provides transportation services to passengers and is able to help with the household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat started out as a small shop has become a major source of income for her family.  Delia constantly introduces new products to her business, and as a result, her store is becoming increasingly crowded.

She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 800 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Iloa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional cooking ingredients.\r\n\r\nIloa is now requesting a new loan of 1,000 WST which will be used to purchase baking equipment. The loan will be her 6th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

People visit the region because of its tropical climate, its fields of flowers, and the wide variety of fruit grown there.\r\nThe Community Bank is made up of fourteen members. They are all very friendly and lively, get on well together, and are good neighbours. They work at different jobs, some in their homes and some out in the community. Here are some examples:\r\nGloria lives in La Estancia, a community located just a few minutes outside of Paute. She is 29 years old, married, and lives with her husband. They have a good marriage and get on well together. They have three children, aged 10, 9, and 8, who attend the local school.

She carries a wide variety of clothing for men, women and children.\r\nThis is her second loan and her business has benefited greatly from the money. She says that all is going well with the members both within the bank and within the community. The loan she is asking for today will be used to buy more clothes such as sweaters and jackets which she sells from her market stall. In order to get a greater variety of clothing, Gloria travels to Cuenca to buy at the Feria Libre.

She also grows vegetables which she sells in the Paute and Gualaceo markets.\r\nZoila has worked for herself for the last six months and has had no problem raising the animals. She says that working independently has many advantages, as she doesn\u2019t neglect her domestic duties, or her husband, and she has more time to spend with her daughter. \r\nThis is her third loan with Kiva partner, Fundacion Espoir, and Zoila is very grateful as she has learned to cope by herself and become an independent businesswoman. She plans to use this loan to expand her farm, buy food for the animals and seeds for her vegetable garden.\r\nHer dream is to continue working so that she can give her daughter a good education and never want for anything.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

P., age 60, is from the village of Tuburan.

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Vinancia has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Vinancia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Vinancia has successfully repaid three previous loans from PMPC. Vinancia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

His wife (pictured) is involved in a manicure business for ladies, also earning about $7.50 per day.\r\n<p>\r\nThe financial crisis has been difficult for business in Cambodia this past year.

is a 53-year-old woman who believes that poverty is not a hindrance to success. She is widowed with six children, two sons and four daughters. She lives in Antipolo City in the province of Rizal in the Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\nLife was not easy for her after the loss of her husband because she has always needed to strive hard to care for and provide food for her children. She was deeply depressed and was almost at the point of losing hope. But her faith in God brought her strength to think primarily of the future of her children.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. She hoped to gain access to capital for her business, which involves the selling of biscuits and rice. She applied her first loans toward her business and found that they brought her sound profits, since rice is the staple food for Filipinos and biscuits are in high demand, particularly by children.\r\n<p>\r\nErmelinda is now requesting a loan of 18,000 pesos as additional capital for her business. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for assorted biscuits worth 3,000 pesos and 14 sacks of rice, all for resale. She is hopeful that the loan will be of big help to her business and she is looking forward to expanding her business. She also aspires to send her sons to school until they finish college and find gainful careers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":371943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy an

Someday, she wishes to become a wholesaler of rice in her village.\r\n\r\nSince Nenita became a member of ASHI, her performances in terms of repayment, attendance during ASHI weekly center meetings, and in her businesses are excellent.

Nicholas drives a tricycle, which is a sidecar attached to the body of a motorcycle used for transportation. Alicia is the mother of four children, two of whom still live at home. The two eldest children have their own families now. The second-eldest, their son Garry, is 25 years old and helps his parents financially by working as a tricycle driver, just like his father. His income augments his parents' income, with the primary goal of being able to sustain his youngest sibling's college education.\r\n<p>\r\nAlicia bought a tricycle six years ago for her husband to manage. The money for the vehicle came from her loan and savings in Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI). She became a member of the institution in 2000. Her first loan was used for starting a business she could run herself: a business in food vending and selling. She gained savings out of her profits from these endeavors, and she thought of investing in something productive that would help her husband. This thinking paid off, for when Garry decided to quit school after high school, he could have his source of income by driving his mother's tricycle, allowing his father to have the occasional day off, which is beneficial to him, considering his age. \r\n<p>\r\nAlicia has great determination in her life, but she has always been disappointed that her three eldest children did not attend college. This has provided inspiration to her youngest child, who is eager to pursue higher education. The effort and industry she has seen from her mother in running her business has inspired her and given her reason to make good in her studies. She is determined to graduate from college.    \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan will be used for the franchise renewal of the tricycle and will also be spent for some necessary vehicle repairs. A small portion will also be used to finance Alicia's food vending business.

Due to insufficient income, he was not able to send them all to college. Three are still studying and two of his eldest children are already working in Manila after their graduation from high school. His eldest works as a waiter and his second-eldest works as a helper. \r\n<p>\r\nHe is not losing hope that someday, his three younger children will finish their college education.

hails from the mountainous city of Antipolo in the province of Rizal in the Philippines. Her business partner is her husband, Ricardo, who is 54 years old. Estelita is the mother of two sons and three daughters, all of whom are grown. But the urge to strive for a living and to get out from poverty is still burning within her.\r\n<p>\r\nHer aspiration to cut the rope of poverty that ties her way to success caused her to join ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 2004. She has applied her loans toward her fried chicken business. Specifically, she buys chickens, cleans and fries them, and sells the prepared food in the village. She even sometimes receives orders from other villages. This business has brought her enough income to support her family.\r\n<p>\r\nNow on her eighth loan, Estelita has requested a loan of 30,000 as additional capital for her fried chicken sales business. Part of the loan will also be used to finance her secondary business: she runs a general store where she sells such items as rice, charcoal, and meat. She been operating the business for several years and is hopeful that her business will continue to prosper.\r\n<p>\r\nHer aspiration is to expand her business and she dreams of having a space in the market someday. She also hopes to have a bigger and more durable house built on her own

Kurbon is an energetic man who has been a farmer for 15 years. He is happily married to a hardworking woman who always supports him. She has helped him get ahead in life and has given him 4 children. Like most other people in the zone who depend on the vegetable crop, Kurbon needs to buy agricultural supplies that will allow for the maintenance and production of his crops up to the optimum harvest time. With this purpose Kurbon applied to IMON International for a loan of 3500 Somoni to purchase agricultural supplies like seeds and fertilizer. Kurbon and his beloved family sincerely thank you for your support.   \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community. Elvie has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 3,000.00 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn March 2009, Elvie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elvie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000.00 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make food products for sale. Elvie is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make food products for sale. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Elvie from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of the borrower's family. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

years ago, Sofia opened a general store. Having been a member of ASHI since 2000, she was able to borrow business capital in order to start her general store. Her husband's income from farming, which was the initial business they supported with their first loans, had been the family's other source of income until the present. \r\n\r\nTo enhance her business, Sofia wishes to borrow money from ASHI. With that she will be able to buy the necessary equipment that would complete the service her store gives to people - like selling cold beverages and other frozen foods.\r\n\r\nSofia is happy and glad because she has the capacity now to grow a business. However, during her life she has regretted being poor. None of her four children have reached college. Although they now have their own family and their own sources of income, Sofia wants to establish a stable business which her children and grandchildren can inherit when she passes away, since their livelihoods are sporadic. With loans she gets from ASHI she will be able to continue to enhance her business.

years old Lolita and her husband live with their two sons and three grandchildren.

Her loans have also financed her husband's farming. Most of all, it had made her an entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nLolita sells rice, gasoline for motorcycles, and dried fish in their own village. She chose to sell these items because they are the most salable to people, considering the village, which is very poor, lacks  accessibility to any kind of transportation and the market is very far. The fare alone when buying things people need in the market is already expensive. At least with Lolita's business, people don't need to go to market for the basic things they need.\r\n\r\nThrough loans she is able to get from ASHI, Lolita wants to expand her business and sell more items for the accessibility of her neighbors and other people in the village.

N. is from the village of Puntod.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale. Modesta has been engaged in her business for over 50 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2005, Modesta joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Modesta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Modesta is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Modesta from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and used as working capital.\r\n\r\nCherry Lyn is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her 7th from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

While not her only means of generating revenue, selling a variety of \"viands\" in the local community is Annalie's primary source of income. Annalie has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, Annalie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Annalie is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make food products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Annalie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children and to supplement the income of her family.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>About HSPFI:<p>\r\n\r\n<p>HSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Three of her three children, two sons and a daughter, have already married and live separately with their own families, so only their youngest son, 23, who is a student, still lives with them. With only the three of them, it is easier to make ends meet, but as harvesting time is approaching, Jyldyz needs a loan to cover expenses on hired labor and fuel. With part of this loan she would also like to purchase wheat seeds in advance for lower prices. Among Jyldyz\u2019s dreams that she is determined to fulfill are purchasing a house and car for her son and increasing the total population of their livestock.  <p>\r\n\r\nJyldyz has three partners: Elmira, Suyumkan and Ainagul. Elmira is 44, a widow and mother of three daughters. Having received a piece of land from the village council to farm on, Elmira needs a loan to purchase 1650 pounds of wheat seeds, pay for labor and buy fuel. <p>\r\n\r\nSuyumkan, 51, and her husband are farmers who grow wheat and sunflowers. Farming allows them to live independently, and Suyumkan needs a loan to purchase seeds and fuel.  <p>\r\n\r\nAinagul, 51, has raised five children. Having obtained land from the village council and investing in it, she has been farming for the last 18 years.  Her monthly income is now $130, and she needs a loan to buy threads for stacking hay, fuel, to pay for labor and invest the rest in construction.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":372150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy wheat seeds in advance and cover expenses on hired labor and fuel.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kant","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2009-08-18T14:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jyldyz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suyumkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ainagul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":45000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8265},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8525},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":8982},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":9433},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9795}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.85},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.92},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.58},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.1},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":228.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":192.85,"local_amount":8265,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":8408.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87078268,"comment":null},{"amount":198.92,"local_amount":8525,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:46:57Z","rounded_local_amount":8672.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96993955,"comment":null},{"amount":209.58,"local_amount":8982,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":9137.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103838939,"comment":null},{"amount":220.1,"local_amount":9433,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":9596.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110730725,"comment":null},{"amount":228.55,"local_amount":9795,"processed_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":9964.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118121275,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-18T19:33:18Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:08:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":129917,"name":"Kem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"L., 51, is the widowed mother of four children, three of whom are single and the other one is married and lives separateL..

In spite of her degree in engineering, she started a small convenience store business in early 2008. Her convenience store is located in a busy suburban area of the city; therefore, her business does pretty well.\r\n\r\nBat-Erdene mostly purchases her inventory of food products from Ulaanbaatar's various wholesale markets, where she is able to find the best deals in the city. Some of the food products are delivered by the producers. The selling volume usually peaks during national holidays and in the fall when school starts.\r\n\r\nAs school starts in September, Bat-Erdene requests a loan to stock up her food inventory in order

Jacqueline never went to school. Jacqueline is married to Constant. Jacqueline has two children, and in addition to her children, has five people in her care.

Jacqueline is a dressmaker by training, but she also sells various products (sweets, biscuits, cartons of milk, sardines, tomatoes, sugar, food pastes, soap for laundry, dishwashing, and personal use, batteries, candles, etc.). Jacqueline buys these items in Dantokpa, the grand international market in Benin, and resells them at her house in her dressmaking workshop. It has been four years since Jacqueline opened her workshop, where she sells various items in addition to the clothing she makes.

When she was married she looked for a job to help her husband and one of her main abilities was the preparation of food. Consequently she started her business of selling food in her home, where she provides daily lunch service to a group of builders who work at construction sites in the surrounding area. Hermelinda began with a few builders at first, but after tasting the delicious seasonings on her food they invited their fellow workers. Now she serves a large amount of customers, who she attends to until 2 in the afternoon. After finishing with this work she prepares everything that she needs for the next day\u2019s menu. Her wish for the future is to install a larger dining area inside her house, as she envisions owning a restaurant that is open 24 hours. The aspects that she likes the most about her village bank is the commitment and the responsibility that it promotes. It has been five years since she formed a group within Microfinanzas PRISMA, with whom she has gone through eight cycles of loans. The 1500 soles that she requests will allow her to purchase the necessary products and ingredients for the preparation of food for her daily lunch crowd. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laurie Paguio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":372358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","use":"for the purchase of ingredients and products to prepare lunches","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-18T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hermelinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":223.91},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":233.98},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":242.92},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":255.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":266.11},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":277.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.37},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.89},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.02},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.41},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.14},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":78.37,"local_amount":223.91,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":233.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081179,"comment":null},{"amount":81.89,"local_amount":233.98,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:58:56Z","rounded_local_amount":243.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997330,"comment":null},{"amount":172.32,"local_amount":492.35,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":512.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842674,"comment":null},{"amount":192.42,"local_amount":549.76,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-19T10:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":572.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734256,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

This will allow her to serve more people and increase her revenue.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting her 8th loan from Microfinanzas PRISMA.  Her previous loans have enabled her to improve her quality of live and her capacity for organization, which is the second most important value stressed by her Communal Bank (next to commitment).  Agripina will use her loan of 2000 soles to buy utensils needed to make the food that she sells.  She will also purchase her desired food cart so that she can expand and improve her space.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":372506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase utensils & a new food cart","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-20T07:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agripina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":298.65},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":312.09},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":324.01},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":340.72},{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":354.94},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":369.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.79},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.36},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.99},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100.79,"local_amount":298.65,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":299.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081183,"comment":null},{"amount":105.33,"local_amount":312.09,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":313.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997334,"comment":null},{"amount":109.36,"local_amount":324.01,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":325.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842678,"comment":null},{"amount":359.52,"local_amount":1065.25,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1069.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734260,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.
