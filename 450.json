She lives in a city in Pakistan called Multan, famous for its shrines and sweetmeats. She owns a small house of two rooms where she has been living with her family for over ten years.\r\n\r\nHajran\u2019s son\u2019s name is Majid Ali and he is thirteen years old and is studying in 8th standard. She wants to provide him with a good education and that\u2019s why she works hard by operating her sewing business. She is very good at her art and gets regular orders from her neighbors and relatives as well.\r\n\r\nHajran\u2019s husband\u2019s name is M. A. and he runs a grocery shop in the nearby market. His shop is the busiest one in the marketplace and his customers respect him for his good behavior. He never compromises on the quality of his goods and this is one of the reasons that people come to him to buy their groceries. He has been in this business for the past four years.\r\n\r\nHajran has applied for a loan from Asasah for her husband\u2019s business.

She has given birth to three daughters. All of her daughters are enrolled in a local school and read in 5th, 4th and 2nd standards respectively.\r\n \r\nNasreen\u2019s husband is involved in a dairy business. He has a buffalo at his home from which he gets milk and sells it to different milk shops. He has been doing this work for over 10 years. With this business, he has been able to enroll his daughters into school.\r\n \r\nNasreen has applied for a loan from Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan amount, he will buy another buffalo and increase the milk production of his business.\r\n \r\nNasreen is hopeful that this investment will bring a positive change to her husband\u2019s business and her family will be able to live in a far better position. This is the first time she has applied for a loan from any microfinance institution (MFI) and she wants to build a long-term relationship with Asasah.

C. is 24 and engaged with 1 child.

SPBD's loans are Mouena's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.  She has had 2 previous loans with this organization, and is asking for a new loan of WST 2,000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD, and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She is very happy that, with the loan, she has been able to provide satisfactory services without delay to her regular customers. She now wishes to access a larger loan to expand her handicraft business and earn more profits. Encarnacion thanks Kiva for providing her with the opportunity to increase her income. Your support is important to her family and they are very grateful.\r\n\r\nEncarnacion joined Kiva partner ASHI to follow her dream of providing her family with a decent life. Prior to joining ASHI, Encarnacion had no access to capital to support her entrepreneurial dreams, but she got her first loan from ASHI and started her own business weaving sleeping mats using panan (a kind of palm) leaf. As she continued to get loans from ASHI and save some of her profits, she was able to grow her business. Now she makes other kinds of handicrafts, such as native bags from abaka (banana leaf) fiber, hats, placemats made from twigs, and other home decorations. Many souvenir shop owners visit Encarnacion's village to purchase her products. Other customers are tourists and Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) wanting to buy presents for their colleagues abroad. Encarnacion has noticed that her monthly income has almost doubled since receiving her first loan, because she has attracted new customers with her additional inventory. \r\n\r\nNow she is seeking another Kiva loan of 28,000 PHP to maintain her business and purchase more of the raw materials needed for her handicrafts.

With the loan her husband will buy medicines in bulk to sell from his shop and to supply to the clinics as well.

E. of Sitio Calvon, Mambog, Binangonan, Rizal, Philippines, is married. She is 36 years of age. Since 2007, Irene E. has been a member of Ahon sa Hirap, Inc., an MFI partner of Kiva. She came from the Rizal Southwest Branch in Binangonan, Province of Rizal, Philippines. \n\nThe couple was blessed with four children: Joyce Ann is 17 years old, Bernard is 15, Irish is 12 and the youngest, Michaella, is 10 years old. Her eldest graduated from high school but unfortunately, because of financial constraints, she stopped school and is now helping in their buying and selling business. \n\nDespite all the trials in life, Ms. Irene keeps on dreaming for the future of her family, especially her children. She wanted to send them to school and somehow pursue a career because it is the only treasure they can inherit from her. She did not want them to experience the fate she suffered because her parents dis not have the resources to send them to school. \n\nHer desire to bring a bright future for her children encouraged Ms. E. to join Ahon sa Hirap, Inc., and start a business. She joined the organization in the year 2007 and became an active member. Her intention is also to enhance her awareness about the program and at the same time join the groups of people in her neighborhood and meet new friends. She is glad indeed that ASHI also provides the financial assistance to poor families without collateral or guarantee. From then on, she has enjoyed being a member. \n   \nNow, with the help from ASHI and Kiva, she wishes to apply for a loan of 20,000 Philippine pesos to fund her capital because of the demand in her business of buying and selling silver jewelry and products. With this loan, she is optimistic that their income will certainly increase and they can supply the orders of her clients on time and, of course, support her family.

A. who has manufactured furniture for the last ten years.\r\nShe has two children, 2 year old Akram and 4 month old Rizwan. She is a housewife who takes care of her family by staying at home.\r\n  \r\nRani\u2019s husband is in need of money because he wants to buy wood in bulk to fill a large order. Therefore, Rani has applied for a loan from Asasah to help her husband in this regard. She is hopeful that by investing money in her husband\u2019s business, he will be able to make good profits as a result of fulfilling larger orders. She also hopes that an increase in income will make it possible for her family to enjoy a better standard of living and that she will be able to educate her children once they become older.

It is located near Multan, Pakistan. \r\n\r\nShe lives with her family in a four room brick house in the area of Al-Fateh. She is a 43-year-old mother of two sons and a daughter who moved here fifteen years ago with her husband. Both of her sons are illiterate and operate their separate grocery shops in the market. Her daughter is 16 years old and studying in ninth grade.\r\n\r\nIrshaad operates her business selling clothes, which she purchases from Multan and sells to her community and to cloth shops. Irshaad started her clothes-selling business two years ago. She has applied for a loan for her own business. With the loan amount, she will buy clothes in bulk. This purchasing in bulk will allow her to cut the cost of travelling and also to offer more variety to her clients.\r\n\r\nAnother source of income for Irshaad\u2019s family is rent; they have rented out the upper portion of their house for about 3500 Pakistan Rupees per month.  She is hopeful that she will be able to increase her income by investing in her business.\r\n\r\nIrshaad is a new loan user of Asasah and this is her first loan cycle.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Some women have proved to be successful as providers of families and owners of business. Anarkan D., leader of the group, is one those women. She is 53 and divorced. She raised 4 children alone with the help of her business. Now her elder son is 25 and he works as foreman in the company named \u201cAlyukobond\u201d, her second son works in Russia, her daughter is seamstress and the youngest son is a student. \r\n\r\nBut 22 years ago she had to start her business alone in order to provide her children only with a calf that was given by her relatives as a present for the birth of her second child in compliance with Kyrgyz national traditions.  Using the calf meat and initial investments of 3,000 soms, she started doing and then selling meat dumplings. Now she has hired two assistants who make 20 kilograms of meat dumplings a day. Her business brings her 1,000 soms monthly. \r\n\r\nIn order to increase her profits she is planning to buy small cattle, fatten it for slaughter and use this meat in making meat dumplings. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t have sufficient funds, therefore she is applying for a loan. This loan will help Anarkan reduce the costs on the purchase of meat and as a result increase her profits. \r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\nNargiza D. is the treasurer of the group.  She is 32 and married. She has a son of 14 years.  Her husband is working as a driver on the fish-factory. She works as a seamstress. Still, their wages are not enough to cover their living expenses. Thus, they started seven years ago their own family business. Mainly, this business is on Nargiza because her husband is working in the capital of Kyrgyzstan \u2013 Bishkek. When their son became 5, their relatives gave them as a present a calf. With this calf she started her business. She fattened it and then sold it. So this is how she started her business of buying, fattening and selling a calf with the purpose of making profit. Monthly she gets 1,200 soms. For now, due to the successful functioning of her business, she can make capital repairs to her house. She is applying for loan in order to continue her business. But now she wants not just to sell a calf but also she is considering an opportunity of exchanging it for a milk cow and then selling milk in the mornings. \r\n\r\nIbarat K. is 53 and widow. She has 3 children. Her first son is 23, her second son is 21 and both of them work as builders. Her daughter is 16 and she is student. During her summer break, she works as washerwoman at car wash. Since the situation in the country changed a lot, she lost a job and it forced her to consider options of starting her own business. She decided to breed cattle. She is almost three years in cattle breeding business. She started it with initial investments of 2,000 soms and it brings her monthly 1,700 soms. On the money received as profits from her business, she is able to pay tuition fee for her daughter at her institution of higher education and she could buy household appliances for her house. Now, she needs funds to buy another calf, fatten it and sell it. Therefore, she is applying for a loan which will help her to develop her business. \r\n\r\nNazarbek K. is 42 and married. He is a builder in the capital of Kyrgyzstan \u2013 Bishkek. He has 3 children. The elder son is 15, his second son is 13, his little daughter is 7 and all of them go to school. His wife is working at the grill factory. Still, in order to have enough money to provide his family, he started breeding cattle. Here, his elder son and his wife assist him while he is at work. They started breed cattle upon the advice of his wife\u2019s parents to buy a calf, fatten and sell it. He is 10 years in the cattle-breeding business with an initial investment of 4,000 soms. This business brings 1,300 soms monthly. On the profits from his business, he could provide his family, pay for their education and make partial capital repairs of his house. Now, he applying for a loan to buy a calf, fatten and sell it. After selling it, he is planning to add money and to buy a milk cow and then sell milk. This will help him to increase his profits from business and make him closer to his dream to build a big and beautiful house.   \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mostly, in developing countries, governments are not able to provide desirable support to their citizens. Thus, people cannot just rely on the help of the government. Therefore, either voluntarily or due to absence of other opportunities, people start up their own business in order to provide for  themselves.\r\n\r\n Aikumush B., leader of this group, is one of those people. She is 53 and married. She has a son of 12 years old and he goes to school. Earlier, her husband was working and providing for the family, but then he retired. The amount of retirement allowance received from the government was 1875 soms, which is not enough to cover living expenses. \r\n\r\nAikumush tried to find a job but she is 53 and it is well-known that as you get older, your employment chances decrease. One year ago, being tired out from searching for a job, she decided to start her own business \u2013 livestock breeding. She started with an initial investment of 2000 soms and now the business brings in 7500 soms monthly. 7500 soms are quite enough to provide for herself and members of her family. Still, she believes that she could increase profits from her business if she had more livestock. Thus, she is applying for a loan in order to buy at least one more sheep.  Increased profits will give her an opportunity to realize her wish to make capital repairs on her home and pay for better education for her son. \r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\nDzhyldyzgul E. is the group treasurer. She is 48 and married. She has a daughter of 5 years old. Her husband is pensioner and his retirement allowance is 1924 soms per month. Like Aikumush, the leader of the group, she was in search of a job during a certain period, but couldn\u2019t find a job. Following the suggestion of her neighbors, 4 years ago, she decided to start up her business \u2013 cattle breeding. She started her business from 10,000 soms. For now, she has significantly increased the number of heads of cattle, and cattle breeding gives her 3000 soms monthly. She is applying for a loan in order to buy 8 sheep to fatten and sell.  With the profits received, she is planning to build a new house. \r\n\r\nKunduz A. is 37 and married. She has 3 children. Her daughter is 7 and her sons are 4 and 1 and a half years old. Her daughter goes to school. Her husband is a guard of an area with crops and he receives 2500 soms. In order to help her husband, 2 years ago, Kunduz  decided to start breeding cattle. She took 15,000 soms from the family budget and bought cattle. She buys cattle, fattens and then sells them at a higher price and it brings her 3500 soms monthly. She has increased the number of heads of cattle and she is planning to increase that number again. With the help of a loan, she will be able to buy 2 more head of cattle in order to continue the functioning of her business and make repairs to her house for the winter period.\r\n\r\nDzhambulat B. is 49 and married. He has two sons, 21 and 13 years old. The younger son goes to school. His wife is a housewife and assists her husband in taking care of their household. He is a taxi driver and his income is 6000 soms monthly. However, 15 years ago, before becoming a taxi driver, he started breeding cattle with an initial investment of 5000 soms. During the last 15 years, it was income from cattle breeding (6000 soms monthly) that helped him to provide for members of his family. Since he is also employed as a taxi driver now, his elder son helps him in breeding cattle. Now, his elder son is planning to get married and thus, they need money in order to put on a small traditional wedding. Thus, they are applying for loan which will give them an opportunity to increase the number of head of cattle, fatten and sell them at a higher price, and increase their profits. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is 24 and single. Like Chynygul, she works at village administration. She also needs a cell phone. She applied for a loan in order to buy a cell phone which will move her to a new level of communication with her relatives, friends, and colleagues. As she receives her wages, she will gradually repay her loan.\r\n<p>\r\nKanatbek M. is 28 and married. He has two children, a four-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son. His wife is a housewife. Two years ago, he decided to start cattle breeding with an initial investment of 2,000 soms. For now, he receives 1,500 soms monthly, but he plans to increase the number of cattle and, as a result, increase profits from cattle breeding. Also, cattle breeding helped him to buy his car, a Daewoo Tico. In order to increase the number of cattle, he needs to buy more heads of cattle. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t have enough funds. Thus, he is applying for a loan. With the profit from cattle breeding, he plans to increase the number of cattle. \r\n<p>\r\nGulhan T. is 58 and married. She has five children. Her sons are 33 and 26, and her daughters are 37, 36, and 29. Her daughters are married and live independently. Her first son is a teacher at a college, and her second son is in Russia. Her husband is a pensioner, while she breeds cattle with the help of her first son. Six years ago she decided to buy a cow because, in her opinion, it was safer than just holding money. After that, she decided to breed cattle. Now, they have 25 heads of cattle, which they will fatten and sell. With the profit from cattle breeding, she could buy a car for her son and make capital repairs to her house. Starting her business with 2,000 soms, she now makes 20,000 soms monthly. She is applying for a loan in order to buy two goats, fatten them, and resell them in the future at a higher price. With the profit from cattle breeding, she plans to buy a truck for transportation of cattle. \r\n<p>\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious, and socially focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Day by day, women around the world become more independent. They either choose to be independent or are forced by circumstances. Anyway, we see a general trend that women provide for their families, become independent of their husbands and gradually move from lower positions to the positions of CEO, leaders of political parties, diplomats, deputies and even presidents. \r\n\r\nAigul T., the leader of the group, is one of those women who were forced to start businesses in order to raise and feed their children after being divorced. She is 36 and has three children. Her elder son is 15 and her daughters are 13 and 3 years old. She doesn\u2019t have a university degree from a top business school, but she found skills and the knowledge to earn money. \r\n\r\nShe started her business by cooking pies, samsy and ashlyamfu (Kyrgyz traditional food) 12 years ago with an initial investment of 3,000 soms and each month she receives 10,000 soms as income. Now, her son and daughter go to school and the youngest daughter goes to kindergarten. With her children, she dreams to buy a big house. She already has accumulated a considerable amount of money. However, she cannot afford to buy the house of her and her children's dreams yet. \r\n\r\nThus, Aigul decided to broaden the sphere of her business. She decided to buy school and office accessories in Bishkek (capital of Kyrgyz Republic) and then resell them at a higher price in her village (the Issykkul region of the Kyrgyz Republic). She is asking for a loan because she doesn\u2019t have enough funds to realize the above described business idea.\r\n \r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\nGulbarchyn O. is treasurer of the group. She is 62 and a widow. Her children are grown up and live independently of their mother. She has a cattle-breeding business. The business was started three years ago with the initial investment of 8,000 soms and has a monthly income of 5,300 soms. She helped one of her children with the beginning of construction of a new house. Now she wants to help her son repair his truck. Thus, she is applying for this loan.\r\n\r\nBakytbek K. is 35 and recently married. He was working in a dental clinic but due to the low salary, he decided to open his own dental clinic. He started his business five years ago with the initial investment of 2,000 soms. Now he receives 15,000 soms monthly. He is applying for a loan in order to buy necessary medicines. \r\n\r\nMaksatbek M. is 25 and married. He has a son who is 3 years old. He is a taxi driver in the military registration and enlistment office. His wife is a shop assistant. Still, their wages are not enough to live together and raise their 3-year-old child. Together with his wife, he started a bakery business one year ago with the initial investments of 500 soms. Their business brings them 9,100 soms monthly. They already have bought a boiler and they are applying for a loan in order to buy a microwave and flour. Together with his wife, they are planning to open a cafeteria. \r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.Mol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3 Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

This was in the mind of Koisun T. eight years ago, when she started her business alone. After being divorced from her husband and receiving no help from him, she started considering options of starting up a business in order to provide for her two children. She started making pasties and selling them at the local market and shops with an initial investment of 1000 soms. Then she saved some money and started buying wholesale vegetables and selling them at the local market. Her business helped her to raise her children and give them an education. Now, Koisun is 45 and divorced. Her son is 20 and her daughter is 18. Also, she has bought a calf with the profits from her business to fatten it and sell it in the future at a higher price.    Her business brings her 8000 soms monthly. She is applying for a loan in order to continue her business, buying wholesale cabbages, peppers, and cucumbers and selling them at a higher price. With the profits from her business, she wants to give quality higher education to her daughter, help her son financially to get married, and buy a big house for her family.\r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\nGulsora B. is treasurer of the group. She is 29 and married. She has three children. Her son is 11, one daughter is 9 and her younger daughter is 4. All of them go to school. Her husband earns a living by making capital repairs. Due to the absence of work opportunities, Gulsora decided to start her business by buying wholesale detergents in the capital of Kyrgyzstan and selling them at a higher price in her region. She started her business with an initial investment of 3000 soms. After a certain period of time, she decided to switch from selling detergents to vegetables because that promised higher profits. Now, her monthly income is 20,000 soms. With the profits from her business, Gulsora has been able to provide for members of her family and buy a cow. Now, she is applying for a loan in order to buy another cow and hay for her. She believes that another cow will increase her profits and then she could realize her plan to build a house and buy a car for her family. \r\n\r\nNurbek T. is 39 and married. He has 3 children. His elder daughter is 15 and is studying in the US, his second daughter is 4 and his youngest child, a son is one month old. Two years ago, together with his wife, he started selling convenience goods right at their home with initial investments of 5000 soms. Then they decided to put a table next to their house and sell convenience goods there. After a time, with the profits from selling convenience goods, they decided to build a shop near their house. Also, the profits from the shop gave them an opportunity to buy goats to breed. From that moment, they have separated obligations: the shop was under the control of his wife and he focused on goat breeding. Right now, their business brings 13,000 soms monthly. They found an opportunity to increase their profits through increasing the assortment of goods at their shop. Thus, Nurbek is applying for loan to get necessary funds to diversify their assortment. At the same time, he wants to prepare for the winter season and buy one ton of coal. \r\n\r\nRaikan B. is 47 and a widow. She has three children. Her daughter is 19, one son is 15 and her younger son is 8. Her sons are studying in the US. Raikan finished courses as a hairdresser two years ago and decided to start her business by opening a hairdressing salon with an initial investment of 500 soms. She rents a place for her hairdressing salon where she works together with her daughter. Her salon brings her 8000 soms monthly. Now, her daughter is planning to get married. According to Kyrgyz traditions, the mother should provide a dowry for her daughter. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t have enough money therefore she is applying for a loan which will help her to buy a dowry.  \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is 37 and married. She has three children. Her eldest son is 23, her second son is 14, and the youngest son is 11. Her eldest son is a student and the second and the youngest son go to school. Her husband is a tractor driver. 25 years ago, her husband offered to start livestock breeding business in order to earn extra money. She liked that idea and assigned 3000 soms from the family budget for purchase of livestock. Now her livestock breeding business has functioned successfully for almost 25 years and it brings in 10,000 soms monthly. With the profits from the business, she bought a car for her husband and the whole family. In order to continue breeding livestock she needs 100 kilogram of forage for her animals and also she wants to buy one more sheep in order to increase the number of livestock she has. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t have sufficient funds, therefore she is applying for a loan. \r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\nMamlakat H. is treasurer of the group. She is 31 and married. She has 3 children. Her elder son is 10, her second son is 8 and her daughter is 2. Her sons go to school and her daughter is still at home. Her husband is a master in a service center. She works as a distributor of medicines but her main activity is cattle breeding. She started her cattle breeding business 10 years ago. Once, on the birthday of her son, relatives made a generous present for her child and Mamlakat decided to use that present as a start for her business. After starting her business with 3000 soms, now she gets 5000 soms monthly from cattle breeding. With the profits from cattle breeding, she has already made capital repairs at her house and bought a car for her husband. In order to continue the successful functioning of her business, she is applying for loan which will give her an opportunity to buy two head of cattle to fatten and sell. \r\n\r\nSapar N. is 68 and married. His wife is housewife. He has two children. His son is 36 and his daughter is 33. Both of them are working in Russia. Children here actively support their parents in all ways and especially financially. Nurdin in his turn, breeds cattle. He inherited cattle breeding from his parents, because they also bred cattle. He has been 40 years in the cattle breeding business which he started with initial investments only of 400 soms. Now, it brings him in 8000 soms monthly. He is applying for loan with the purpose of buying 2 head of cattle to fatten and sell at a higher price. \r\n\r\nAbdubahap E. is 28 and married. His wife is a housewife and helps her husband in his business. For now they don\u2019t have any children. Abdubahap started breeding cattle 15 years ago with an initial investment of 4000 soms. Now, he has been able to increase the number of heads to 2 cows with one calf and 6 head of small livestock; cattle breeding brings in 7000 soms monthly. He is applying for a loan in order to buy 6 more head of livestock to fatten and sell at a higher price. In the near future, he is planning to further increase the number of livestock in his herd and make capital repairs to his house with the profits from his business. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She has two daughters, 6 and 4 years old. Okasana and her husband are farmers, but her husband works as a builder when there is an opportunity. Right after their marriage, her husband suggested breeding cattle. They started breeding cattle together 2 years ago with an initial investment of 10,000 soms. With the help of profits from cattle breeding they improved their living conditions significantly. Now, they receive 1500 soms a month as a profit from cattle breeding and in order to increase their profits they want to buy farm animals. With money received from the loan Okasana wants to purchase two farm animals and hay to feed them during the winter season. This loan would help them increase their profits and provide better living conditions for their two little daughters. \r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\nShaiyr O. is treasurer of the group. She is 60 and married. She has a daughter who is 20. Her daughter works as a seamstress. Her husband is farmer and Shaiyr has been  breeding cattle for almost 2 years. She started breeding cattle with an initial investment of 2500 soms. Now, she makes 1500 soms monthly from cattle breeding. In order to increase her profits, she's planning to buy 4 more ewes, then fatten and sell them at a higher price. She already has educated her daughter about the profits from cattle breeding. Now, she wants to prepare a dowry for her daughter, also from the profits from cattle breeding. \r\n\r\nUlan O. is 35 and married. He has two sons, 9 and 8 years old.   Both of his sons go to school. His wife is a seamstress. Ulan in his turn combines cattle breeding with a job as a taxi driver in order to provide for members of his family. He has been in the cattle breeding business for two years; he started with initial investments of 20,000 soms. Now, it brings him 2000 soms monthly. Like other group members, in order to increase his profits from cattle breeding, he needs more head of cattle. So, this is the first reason for his application for a loan. The second reason is that he needs to make car repairs so as to continue his job as a taxi driver. With the profit from a loan, he is planning to increase significantly the number of head of livestock he has and buy a flat in the capital of Kyrgyzstan (Bishkek) where his children can enjoy better educational opportunities. \r\n\r\nAlmazbek O. is 40 and married. He has two daughters, 6 and 4 years old. His wife is a teacher of the Kyrgyz language at a local school. Almazbek as well as Ulan has to combine his job as an engineer with agriculture in order to provide for members of his family. 7 years ago, he received as a present from his parents an area under cultivation, which pushed him to start sowing potatoes and wheat. He started sowing potatoes and wheat with initial investments of 3000 soms. Profit from agriculture provided for his family and improved the living conditions of his family. Besides this, he bought furniture for his house. His profit from agriculture is 1500 soms per month. Now, he wants to start cattle breeding. In order to start cattle breeding, he needs to buy at least one head of cattle. Thus, he is applying for a loan. This loan will help him to buy one head of cattle and forage for cattle. He believes that he will increase significantly his herd. On the received profits, he wants to make capital repairs on his house and provide better living conditions for his family. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is married to Alfredo T., an entrepreneur, and is the mother of a kid of elementary school age. By the grace of God, Snooky has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her child all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Snooky; she, herself, has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nSnooky operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages, piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. The owner earns an income by buying supplies wholesale and selling retail in small quantities.\r\n\r\nAside from the usual products, Snooky also managed to incorporate local snacks like her popular breakfast fare into her business. Morning commuters and early risers flock to her store to buy some champorado (native chocolate rice porridge), lugaw (savory chicken, egg and tripe rice porridge), sweet spaghetti, pansit (soy noodles) and similar items. Snooky\u2019s store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Snooky is requesting a Php 21,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She will also invest some of the loan in buying raw ingredients for her breakfast fare. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n \r\nSnooky dreams of being able to give her child a good and high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes to someday have her own stall where she can sell her products. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":589424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

This is Realiza G., 38, resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Romeo G., a carpenter, and mother of two children, one of whom are already in elementary while the youngest, just barely able to toddle around, is the apple of Realiza and Romeo\u2019s eyes. By the grace of God, Realiza has managed to support her older child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send both of her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Realiza, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nRealiza operates a meat shop. Live pigs are bought from hog raisers and then slaughtered and sold to the immediate community. She has many patrons who buy the cut meat and then sell it at their respective market stalls. There are many patrons who prefer Realiza\u2019s products since they are assured of its freshness and cleanliness. It is also a little cheaper to buy meat from an independent meat shop than the ones in the marker who sometimes use the services of professional slaughter houses for their meat. The cost of slaughter is added to the final price of the cut meat, and passed along to the customers. Thus, Realiza has many patrons who regularly anticipate her meat. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy live pigs to be slaughtered and sold every day. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nRealiza dreams of being able to give both her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her own market stall someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":589429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"buy

is Nenita G., 50, who lives in Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Ediom G. and they have five children ranging from a college whiz to an elementary-school youngster. By the grace of God, Nenita has managed to support her older child's college education. She is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college. A dream for most Filipino parents like Nenita is a college education, as she herself has. She believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nNenita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Juanita's profit comes from buying supplies wholesale and selling in piece rate. Aside from the usual products, Nenita also managed to incorporate meats and cooked food, like her popular lunch and dinner fare, into her business. Commuters, students, and people who don't cook at home, flock to her store to buy adobo (soy chicken or pork), menudo (liver and pork cutlets in a rich tomato sauce with carrots and potatoes), sisig (liver, ear, and other face meat of a pig, grilled then chopped and tossed in vinegar, chili and a little mayonnaise). Nenita\u2019s store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of Php3500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nNenita is requesting a Php18,000 loan to buy more groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her inventory. She also will invest some of the loan to buy raw ingredients for her lunch and dinner fare. She expects to boost her income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nNenita dreams of being able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work. She also hopes to have her own stall where she could sell her products someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":589436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":" to expand her inventory and to buy raw ingredients for her lunch and dinner fare","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-08-25T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nenita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1207.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821765,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6039.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172089009,"comment":null},{"amount":106.67,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:21:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4831.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380375,"comment":null},{"amount":106.66,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4831.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816714,"comment":null},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1207.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652685,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-25T22:01:58Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":225736,"name":"Chhourn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chhourn S., 27, is married and lives with her husband and two children in Kompong Chnang Province, Cambodia -- an area known for quality palm products.

is Emily B., 42. She is a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Rogelio B., a vendor and community marshal. They are blessed in their marriage with four children, one of whom is in high school while one is in elementary school. The two younger children are toddling around the house, bringing joy into the family. Emily and her husband are in good health and have strong physiques, which enables them to work hard for their future together.\r\n\r\nEmily operates a ready-to-wear clothing store. She mainly offers children\u2019s clothing, summer shorts (which are very popular in tropical Philippines), statement shirts and other basic everyday wear. These clothing items are made from sheer cotton fabrics, which are all suited to the hot and humid climate. Most customers only buy made-to-order clothes when it is really necessary, as it is more expensive. Emily\u2019s customers are her immediate community members and neighbors. Emily earns a minimum of 250 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php14,000 loan.

She is married to Precilo S., a mason. She is the mother of four children, one of whom is already working while the other three are still in school, one in college and the other two in high school. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her remaining children all the way through college - a dream for most Filipino parents like Jeanette as she herself was an elementary graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nJeanette operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from those round, palm-sized ones to the much larger doormats, braided quilts and bed sheets, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Besides rugs, Jeanette also retails bulk charcoal to her neighbors to be used as fuel for old-fashioned stoves. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and newspapers for patterns.

is Linda P., 53, resident of Caloocan City, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all of them all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Linda, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nLinda operates a jewelry business. Her husband makes the jewelry while she manages orders, finances and accounts. Gold jewelry, although not as common in the Philippines as silver jewelry, is still in demand, because of its higher value. In her business inventory are gold, silver and semi-precious and precious stones. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more supplies like silver. She also will invest a portion of the loan to pay the repair fee for the machine they use to solder the jewelry. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nLinda dreams of being able to give her family a comfortable and well-off future. She also hopes that her family will soon know her personal Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

Her husband Hernie M., who is 44 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who range from 16 to 18 years old. \r\n\r\nHelen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 12,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,400, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she could continue to save up for the future of her family and for her children's education. Helen M. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

B. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Rizal, Brgy. Poblacion, Dalaguete, Cebu.  She earns her living by operating a general store  business.  Her husband Ignacio B., who is 50 years old, works as a maintenance man to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 22 and 23 years old. \r\n\r\nGilla joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gilla has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she could continue to save up for the future of her children and to buy more goods for her general store. Gilla B. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Brgy. Pugalo, Alcoy, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general-store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 9,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nEster is now borrowing PHP 10,500 so that she could buy additional stock to sell in her general store. This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Ester aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") way. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Many of the members also work in small businesses, so the help offered them by Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya was very important to them.  It is worth pointing out that through the committee they were able to increase their earnings and improve their living conditions even more everyday.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Carmen, who makes and sells ao po\u00b4i handicrafts (ao po\u00b4i is a special cotton fabric used for making handcrafted items).  She makes shirts, dresses, tablecloths and other items, and they are much admired by other people, which makes them sell quickly.\r\n\r\nCarmen is very hardworking and says that she will continue working and is very happy to be able to help her family.  She is asking for the loan to buy ao po\u00b4i cloth.\r\n\r\nIt is important to mention that some of the women make items that are exported to many countries.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a videoke bar and a general store. Her husband Pedro D., who is 39 years old, works as a miner and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 11 children who are 8 months to 20 years old.  \r\n\r\nMa. Magdalina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Magdalina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 which she intends to use to expand her business so that she can continue to save up for their future and provide a better life for her children. Ma. Magdalina D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has a chicken coop on the patio of her house.  Due to a lack of opportunities, six years ago she withdrew the savings she had and invested in chickens.  Her business grew very rapidly because of the good reception her business got from her neighbors.  Now she has the chicken coop and works beginning at six in the morning.  She sells the chickens (dead and skinned) to her neighbors and to the stores in her neighborhood.  To better present her chickens, she wants to rebuild the coop; for this reason, with the loan she wants to purchase both blocks and chickens.

Catarman I, Cordova, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 5 business ventures: a Sari-Sari (General) Store, Ready to Wear (RTW), Electronic Re-loading, Water Vending and another retailing business. Her husband, Arnel I., who is 39 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living. They have 2 children who are 16 and 20 years old.  \r\n<p>\r\nLeonida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she wished for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Leonida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000 which she intends to use for additional funds for her business. Her goals are to continue to save for the future, let her children finish their studies and to expand the businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nLeonida I. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. (Dungganon is a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable.) Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

J. is a single woman who lives in Sitio Quiao, Brgy. Alijis, Valladolid, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a business venture: a general store.  \r\n<p>\r\nCecile joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cecile has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 24,000 which she intends to use to buy additional items for the general store. She wants to use the extra profit to continue to save for the future. Cecile D.

Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

S. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Malinong, Brgy. Miranda, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental.  She earns her living by operating a passenger transport business. Her husband, Jose S., who is 50 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living. He also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 17 to 28 years old.  \r\n<p>\r\nConsolacion joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Consolacion has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 which she intends to use to buy a tricycle so that she can continue to save for future home repairs and business expansion. \r\n<p>\r\nConsolacion S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. (Dungganon is a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable.) Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

ine P. is a married woman who lives in Prk. Ampalaya, Brgy. Gun-ob, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu City. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and pig fattening. Her husband Angelo P., who is 25 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living. They have a 5-year-old child.  \r\n\r\nGeraldine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Geraldine has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 25,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use for the expansion of her pig-fattening business and to purchase a second-hand motorcycle so that she can continue to save up for the future, improve their house and expand their business. Geraldine P. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.   \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Since 2009, she has been managing a hairdresser salon and  selling beauty and hair care products.

 D. is a 41-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: selling used clothes and an at-home service for manicures and pedicures. She lives in Purok Kaimito, Brgy. Sangi, Toledo City, Cebu.  \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in selling used clothes and in her manicure and pedicure business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nMarites is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Marites aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") way.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They live in San Miguel Xico, Valle de Chalco Solidaridad, Estado de Mexico. The members of the group are: Ma. Gabriela Ram\u00edrez (barbecued meat sale), Fidelia C. (sale from catalog), Ang\u00e9lica R. (ceramics sale), Andrea D\u00e1vila (costume jewellery sale), Josefina E.

(groceries), Ana Karen D\u00e1valos (custome jewellery), Mar\u00eda Teresa C. (tacos), and Epifan\u00eda Olmeda (Clothing store).\r\n<p>\r\nMarisol is 40 years old, she has a daughter in middle school. Marisol became a widow ten years ago and since then she has worked double in order to maintain her family as her mother also depends on her. Marisol has sold jewellery for twelve years and is continuing with this activity as it is very profitable. Every day when she has finished her chores she goes out to offer her merchandise at different places such as homes and stores. As time is worth gold to her she takes advantage of every opportunity given to her.  Marisol stocks up once a week in order to have a variety of earrings, bracelets, and chains to keep her customers satisfied. She sells the most on holidays and during the month of December and obviously most of her customers are ladies. Marisol plans to set up a gift shop to obtain more profit for her family and be able to meet their needs. The loan will be spent on stocking up.\r\n<p>\r\nThey are very pleased with the support offered by Kiva through Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad that enables them to reach their goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

Her clients are pregnant women who frequent the market, despite difficulties arising from a break-down in the supply of merchandise from her providers.  Her strategy is to have a large variety of merchandise, to create a good reception area, to have a good window display in order to better satisfy the needs of her client\u00e8le.  She would like to have a boutique in the future and to be a wholesaler, as well as to make journeys to buy merchandise and to improve her children's schooling conditions.  In her neighborhood, she is said to be calm and polite.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Martha Schmitz, Kiva

The village banks are groups of 10 or more people who, together, hold a bank account and have to meet weekly or fortnightly to make their repayments. They have an elected representative and a committee which oversees the group. This group is based in the commun ity of Valle Verde, in the state of Michoac\u00e1n. The group is made up of 14 members.\n\nThe group's representative is Lidia. Lidia is 41 years old. She went to school until 6th grade: her parents, she says, would not let her continue. They thought it a waste of time and money, as women were only good for being housewives - this is the reason she could not continue her studies. Lidia lives with her partner, Marco, whom she has been with for 12 years. Marco works as a delivery driver and a labourer. They have three children: 11 year old Rub\u00ed, who is at primary school, 6 year old Joshua, who is at kindergarten, and Cielo, who is 3. Lidia is seeking her loan for her business, which is grinding corn. She has had the business for 8 years. She started it because she already had experience of working in a mill, and since there were no mills near her home, she decided to invest in one. Her loan will be used to buy firewood, maize and lime for the tortilla dough. She will grind the corn and sell the dough. One of her dreams is to set up a grocery store next to the mill, and to remodel the premises, put up curtains, sand the fences and paint them. She hopes that soon she will be able to realize these goals.\n\nDulce Lluvia, also a member of the group, is 21 years old and studying in her first year of college. She says she left studying for 7 years, because she went to the United States - seeking the \"American Dream\" as she saw it. She had to return to Mexico, however, because the situation there was very difficult for immigrants. Dulce has a little girl, 11 months old. She is a single mother, and she helps her parents with the household expenses. She works baking bread: it was her mother who started the business and who, over 10 years ago, taught Dulce how to bake bread. Dulce is very happy at being granted this loan, which she will invest in firewood, sugar, flour, butter, etc. She sells her bread from door to door in different neighbourhoods, such as El Rinc\u00f3n, Granjeno and Zitacuaro. She says that one of her dreams is to have a proper bakery. She would like to rent premises and set up her business so she can provide better for her daughter. \n\nThe other 12 members of the group are: Mar\u00eda Guadalupe, Elizabeth, Librada, Mariana S. M., Mar\u00eda Esther S. M., Daniel Garc\u00eda C., Mar\u00eda Sara, Marco Antonio, Mireya C., Reina M., Jazm\u00edn, and Bertha. They want their loans for a variety of enterprises, including selling clothes, making tortillas, making sandals out of recycled tyres, selling fruit, selling sweets, etc.\n\n<br

They will use the money from this loan to buy merchandise, grow their businesses, and increase their incomes that they will use to improve the well being of their families.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":589696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Totonicap\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":113,"posted_date":"2010-08-25T04:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santa Br\u00edgida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aura Rebeca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Antonieta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna Regina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa Dominga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmelina Santos ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sayra Rovelsi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eufemia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":21000,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3512.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172072506,"comment":null},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3512.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177364010,"comment":null},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-30T09:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3512.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182499125,"comment":null},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-10T09:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3512.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188634730,"comment":null},{"amount":875,"local_amount":7000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-22T09:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":7024.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191377778,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-25T14:43:57Z","paid_date":"2011-02-22T09:58:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":225904,"name":"Lupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lupe tiene 31 a\u00f1os, vive con sus 2 hijos en una casa alquilada.

She didn't have the opportunity to attend school, but thanks to a literacy program that she attended, she learned to write. She has four children, two married and two single. Her husband works in agriculture, and she helps with some of the family expenses. She has a business selling clothing and fabric in the plaza of San Francisco el Alto. She has eight years of experience in this business. She relates with enthusiasm that she wanted to aim higher, so with the help of some neighbor women and fellow business women, they organized a group so that they could apply for a loan.

One of their difficulties has been the lack of capital, but now they can get ahead and expect to expand production as well as generate more income.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":589712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Operating capital to buy materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Totonicap\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":113,"posted_date":"2010-08-26T06:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aura Marina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa Olivia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ramona ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bartola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":13000,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2166.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.84},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":270.83,"local_amount":2166.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2174.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172072508,"comment":null},{"amount":270.84,"local_amount":2166.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2174.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177364012,"comment":null},{"amount":270.83,"local_amount":2166.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-30T09:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2174.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182499127,"comment":null},{"amount":270.84,"local_amount":2166.67,"processed_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-10T09:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2174.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188634732,"comment":null},{"amount":541.66,"local_amount":4333.32,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-26T09:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4348.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191377780,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-26T15:04:57Z","paid_date":"2011-02-26T09:28:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":225910,"name":"El Samaritano 2 & 4 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julia is the coordinator of her group Las Samaritanas 2 & 4 (The Samaritans).

She lives with her husband and her youngest child, who is 28 years old. For more than 15 years, she has had a small stationary store where she sells all kinds of stationary supplies and other items for the home. She has her own accounting services office in the same location as her store. \r\n\r\nNancy works independently and this has helped her and her husband to support their family. Now that her children are economically independent from her, she is very happy because she can continue generating her own sources of income, even though she has a lot of competition. For the future, she wants to have more merchandise available. \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP. She is very happy knowing that she has financial support, because she has always been very responsible with her payments. She also likes being a part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible people and very supportive. She is grateful to the people who will contribute to the loan that she is requesting and it will be very useful to her in progressing with her business. She will use the loan she is requesting to buy paper in different qualities and sizes. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":589735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy paper in different qualities ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":513.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154529,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":256.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449841,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:57Z","rounded_local_amount":256.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588534,"comment":null},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":256.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725046,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":256.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463146,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-10T15:58:40Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":225918,"name":"Micheal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Micheal is 29 years old with three children aged 2, 5, and 7 years old.

The group has 10 members, all women, who work in various activities, including: animal husbandry, pants-making, making traditional skirts, and selling food and typical clothing.  Ms. Antonia will use the loan to buy fabric, and in this way she will grow her business and thereby generate more income.

She lives with her husband and four children in their own house. She has been working in agriculture for the past twenty years. She has the assistance of her children and husband in her business. Never the less, there are times when her husband has to go to work in the mines. At this time she has to work extra hard planting potatoes, corn, barley and lima beans. When these items are harvested she brings them to the wholesale market to sell. In this way she is able to make money to support her family. She likes to work in agriculture because it allows her to have a good amount of food in her small grocery market. Even though the work is very intense and difficult, she is always optimistic. In the future she would like to improve her harvests and acquire more animals. This is her third loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she has financial support. She has always been responsible with her payments. Also she is thankful to be part of the communal group because the members are responsible and supportive. She is thankful for those people that will be managing the loan that she is requesting. They have been very useful by helping her improve her business.

She is married to Ernisto, 60 years old, and they have nine grown children. Erlinda  operates a fish-vending business. Her husband works as a Tricycle Driver and also helps in Erlinda's business activities. \r\n\r\nErlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1991 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 32 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,000, and improve the family's standard of living. Erlinda's 33rd cycle loan of PHP 10,000 will be used to buy more fresh fish to sell in her business. Her earnings will help her continue to save for future home renovations. Erlinda J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n \r\nHelp NWTF continue in its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by visiting the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/team\/nwtf_philippines\" target=\"_blank\">NWTF lending

B. is a married woman who lives in Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures, a fishing and a butchery business. Her husband Carlos is 49 years old. He earns his living working as a driver and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children aged 14 to 25. \r\n\r\nMelba joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Melba has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 which she intends to use to buy more fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and education of her children. Melba B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She earns her living by operating two business ventures, charcoal sales and banana sales. Her husband Romeo, age 59, works as a laborer and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are 20 to 35 years old. \r\n\r\nElisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000 which she intends to use to purchase more bananas so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her granddaughter and to sustain her family's daily needs. Elisa B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Sangi Riverside, Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and a house for rental. Her husband Pablo L. is 58 years old and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 31 to 35 years old. \r\n\r\nNelia  joined NWTF - Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 cycle loans from NWTF - Project Dungganon, Nelia  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 26,400, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future of her family. Nelia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our
