is a 35-year-old single mother of two children, ages twelve and three years old. Her twelve-year-old is attending school. She is a farmer in the Murang'a area of the Central Province of Kenya. She's been a farmer for twelve years and sells milk, eggs, bananas, 'sukuma wiki' (kale), and grains. The main challenge in her business is insufficient acreage to plant more fodder (animal feed). She must lease a farm and employ laborers for the cows. She says that sources of capital to undertake more projects are limited.<P>\r\n\r\nShe successfully completed two previous loans through Juhudi Kilimo and has requested this loan for Kes 40,000 to purchase a chaff cutter, which is a device for cutting feed for cattle. In the future, she would like to have a bigger poultry project with over 2,000 layers and at least one good cow producing forty litres a day. She says that she hopes to continue to be a Juhudi client, and that she will be able to save money for her family now because the chaff cutter will reduce waste and the cost of feed.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout Juhudi Kilimo<P>\r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is a for-profit social enterprise focused on the economic development of Kenya.

She is a dairy farmer in the Murang'a area of the Central Province of Kenya and has been farming for three years.

Her family will use the goat milk for consumption so that all the cow's milk can be sold for a better overall income. In the future, she would like to have at least two cows and three dairy goats. She says that Juhudi has helped her acquire her first asset, which calved to a heifer, and that she is very grateful.\r\n\r\nAbout Juhudi Kilimo\r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is a for-profit social enterprise focused on the economic development of Kenya. It has a unique approach to financing agribusiness value chains, from production of raw products to processing and delivery of goods: by providing asset financing and technical assistance funding to smallholder farmers and rural enterprises. This approach to poverty alleviation supports sustainable wealth creation in rural communities, establishes local engines of income generation, and generates employment, economic growth and dynamism as well as demand for inputs.

The couple has two children to support, one of which is their own child and is at school. A year ago the family settled down in the Agla district of Cotonou, the economic capital of B\u00e9nin. Victoire's husband assumes the bulk of the household expenses, but Victoire often helps him with these, thanks to the income which she gets from her activity. Victoire went to school up to university level. But for around four years now she has been selling fabric and shoes in the Sainte Rita district of Cotonou. At the same time she has a refreshment stall where she welcomes her customers who come to pay for their drinks. Victoire gets her supplies in Lom\u00e9 in Togo, one of B\u00e9nin's neigboring countries, and also in Dantokpa, B\u00e9nin's international market. In great demand from her customers, Victoire's ambition is to strengthen her capital and expand her display in order to meet the ever incoreasing demand of her customers.

She sells all kinds of fruit including mangoes, pawpaws, oranges and yellow bananas. She mainly sells retail. She works seven days a week and serves about 30 customers a day. She has been in this business for two years now. Her main challenge is that there are many stalls selling fruit so the competition is very high. \r\n\r\nValantina is 40 years of age and married with three children between the ages of 5 and 15. All her children go to school. She lives in a rented two-room house with six people. She has three meals a day. She takes care of additional family members. Her three largest monthly expenses are utility bills, school fees for her children, and rent for her  residence and business premises. \r\n\r\nValantina has been with MCDT for two years \u2013 now on her fifth loan with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more baskets of fruits and vegetables.

She is a single woman without any children and lives alone, assuming responsibility for her own expenses. Oke Yabo has not been to school. In order to meet her different needs, she has, for almost 16 years, been selling hardware products, a business which she runs with passion and which brings her in an income. Oke Yabo gets her supplies in Nigeria, a neighboring country of B\u00e9nin, and also at Dantokpa, B\u00e9nin's international market.

Now she earns an average monthly income of 20,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) from her business activities.\r\n\r\nPilar is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP was used to fund the operations of her repair shop and rice business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is requesting her 13th loan, in the amount of 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use on her repair shop and to buy more rice to resell. Pilar is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable).

Both her children go to school. She lives in a rented one-room house where she stays with four people. She has three meals a day. She takes care of additional family members. Her three greatest expenses in a month are utility bills, school fees for her children and rent for her residence and business premises. Grace has a stall in Owino Market, one of the busiest markets in Uganda, selling second hand clothes. She mainly sells on a retail basis. She works seven days a week. She serves about 30 customers a day. She has done this business for two years. Her main challenges are that there are many stalls selling second hand clothes, there are few customers coming to them, the increasing prices of second hand clothes and the very high competition.  She has been with MCDT for two years servicing her fifth loan, working all the time with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more bales of second hand clothes. She hopes to see her business grow bigger and start selling on wholesale

Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nDo\u00f1a Sandra se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de leche como una forma de generar ingresos para su familia.

B. is a 39-year-old woman, who lives with her three children in the community of El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, in the province of Cartago. This is a small, rural community with a population of approximately two thousand. The people from the community produce milk and grow coffee. Her land is irregular and much of it is a tropical rainforest. The community has very picturesque scenery, which combines the tropical rainforest with two beautiful lagoons, coffee plantations and dairy farms. El Sauce is located about an hour and a half on a bus from Turrialba, which is the closest commercial center. Nonetheless, many times in the year the road becomes impassable because of the rains in the area. This is, without a doubt, one of the main challenges for the community.\r\n\r\nWhen there weren\u2019t job opportunities available, many people decided to leave to find jobs in Turrialba or on banana plantations in the Atl\u00e1ntica area of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nAt present, the prices of coffee and milk have improved, and, for the most part, her neighbors are looking to invest in projects in their own area and avoid migrating. \r\n\r\nMs. Sandra produces milk to earn income for her family. She says that this makes her very happy because she has been able to go forward.\r\nMs. Sandra wants a small microloan of 500,000 CRC to buy a milk cow and, in this way, to increase the production to milk, since she wants to be a successful micro-entrepreneur. This will also help her family to continue moving forward, whichis one of her motives for working hard and carefully.\r\n\r\nMs. Sandra is a member of the Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be her first loan, and with it, she hopes to continue growing on both a personal and financial level. She is also very thankful for these organizations, which facilitate access to credit so that she can spend more time pursuing productive activities.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

R. P. es una se\u00f1ora de 39 a\u00f1os de edad quien vive con su esposo y sus tres hijos en una comunidad llamada El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nActualmente do\u00f1a Carmen orde\u00f1a a en una peque\u00f1a instalaci\u00f3n de madera que acondicion\u00f3 como sala de orde\u00f1o. Dice que por d\u00eda logra producir aproximadamente 30 litros de leche y con otra vaca su producci\u00f3n aumentar\u00e1 muchos m\u00e1s litros diarios por lo cual esta muy emocionada de poder ver como su negocio crece y se fortalece.\nDo\u00f1a Carmen desea obtener un microcr\u00e9dito por \u00a2500.000(quinientos mil colones) para comprar otra vaca y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. Ella sabe que contar con otra  vaca es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo pero dice que si quiere sacar a su familia adelante tiene que esforzarse en producir m\u00e1s.\n\nDo\u00f1a Carmen es socia de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una de las 100 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica. Este ser\u00e1 su octavo pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico. Tambi\u00e9n destaca que gracias a este tipo de organizaciones y medios facilitadores de cr\u00e9dito puede dedicar m\u00e1s tiempo a las actividades productivas. \n","en":"Carmen R. P., 39, lives with her husband and their three children in the El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba community in the Cartago province.  It is a small, rural community with approximately 2,000 inhabitants.  The inhabitants work at milk production and planting coffee.  The landscape is irregular, and much of the land is humid tropical rain forest.  The community has very picturesque scenery that combines tropical rain forest with two lovely lakes, coffee plantations, and dairy farms.  El Sauce is approximately one and a half hours by bus from Turrialba, which is the closest commercial center.  Several times a year, however, the road becomes impassable because of the rains that fall in the area. This is without a doubt one of the biggest challenges for the community.\r\n\r\nWhen there isn't any work, many people choose to look for jobs in Turrialba or on banana plantations located in the Atlantic region of Costa Rica. Currently the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so the local people are looking to invest in projects in their own areas so they don\u2019t have to travel to find work.\r\n\r\nCarmen currently milks in a small wooden installation set up as the milking room.  She says that she produces approximately 30 liters of milk a day.  With another cow, her production will increase by many more liters daily.  She is excited to be able to see how her business grows and becomes stronger.\r\n\r\nCarment wishes to get a micro loan for \u00a2500,000 (five hundred thousand colones) to buy another cow and increase her milk production.  She knows that having another cow is a big sacrifice and will demand more work.  But, she says that if she wants to get the family ahead she needs to put forth great effort to produce more.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a member of the Association of Producers in El Sauce, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her eighth loan, and she expects to continue growing on a personal level and economically.  She also points out that thanks to this kind of organization that serve as a means of facilitating loans she can dedicate more time to productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Elmira is the leader of this group. She lives in a village with her family. Elmira is 51 years old. At this age, she has two sons and one daughter. One of her sons is married and Elmira has been very happy being able to raise two grandchildren.  Elmira\u2019s husband has already reached retirement age and if he wished he could just stay at home and obtain retirement pension. However having worked all his life, Elmira\u2019s husband has preferred to stay active and engage himself in some kind of job instead of staying at home and having rest. He is working as a stoker at a police station. So has Elmira. She works as a cleaner at the same police station. Elmira would like to make use of her free time and find herself an additional occupation after work. She has decided to get engaged in cattle breeding. Besides, she needs to pay for her daughter\u2019s college education. Therefore Elmira has decided to apply for this loan. She plans to obtain it and purchase a foal for feeding and resale. One of Elmira\u2019s plans is to save money together with her children and make a gift for her husband: buy him a car. \r\n\r\nElmira\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nE. U. Mirbek, 22, is married and has two children. His wife stays at home and takes care of the children. Mirbek works in a fish factory and breeds cattle as well. Mirbek needs a loan to buy five sheep for breeding. \r\n\r\nA. Jazgul, 25, is a mother of two children. Her husband works as a shepherd. Besides he has his own cattle and trades in cattle at the local cattle market. Jazgul has applied for this loan to purchase three sheep for resale. \r\n\r\nO. Ishengul, 49, is a mother of three children. Her husband is disabled. The children work and support their parents. Ishengul cannot work anywhere as she has to look after her husband. Therefore she wants to try cattle breeding. She hopes to obtain this loan and purchase some sheep for resale. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

For this reason Julienne is seeking a fourth loan in order to build up her business and better satisfy her customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robin Clochard, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":479490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of corn and fresh fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-01-29T19:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julienne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:22:04Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123859121,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619262,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653130,"comment":null},{"amount":40.52,"local_amount":18700,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:32:05Z","rounded_local_amount":18959,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835278,"comment":null},{"amount":24.48,"local_amount":11300,"processed_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":11456.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575668,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T07:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954178,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-28T09:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055837,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347376,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482503,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":15207.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617350,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-29T21:02:42Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172517,"name":"Rosette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosette is 30 years old and married with three children aged between three and seven years.

Her main challenges are the rainy season (which disturbs her a lot because she works from an open place, which hinders her customers from reaching her) and the ever- increasing prices of cosmetics.  She has been with MCDT for three years, servicing her sixth loan working all this long with the same group mates.

She is 40 years old and is married with six children aged from one year seven months old to 20 years old.  Victoria also cares for a niece.  Many of her children are in school, and their educational levels are nursery school to 7th grade.  Victoria herself only recently finished high school by taking classes at night school.  When she was younger she had to stop her schooling because of poverty.\r\n\r\nVictoria and her family live in the Pipeline Community, and she works in the Red Light Market, Liberia's largest market which is near the capital, Monrovia.  Her business is the sale of fruit, such as plantain, bananas, oranges, etc. She buys her goods from wholesalers and sells retail from a table in the Red Light Market.  She has been running this business for more than 20 years and hopes to become an exporter of Liberian plantain, banana, oranges and other fruit.\r\n\r\nVictoria originally started her business with 500 Liberian Dollars as her working capital but with hard work, her business has grown.  She sells good, ripe fruit in order to encourage her customers to continue buying from her.  Victoria needs this loan to purchase more fruit for her business.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of being able to help educate her children so that they have a good foundation for their future.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Victoria is the one holding the sign.  Despite the group's name -- United Sisters -- there is one male member, Sungar S., who joined after the initial members had decided on the name.\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.  Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship.  LEAP seeks to help rebuild post-conflict Liberia through its group and individual loans to micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs, and puts emphasis on lending to women.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":479465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more fruit to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Red Light, Paynesville","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"6.5 -9.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":141,"posted_date":"2010-01-29T07:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sungar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LRD","disbursal_amount":52000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2145},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3835},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3835},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3835},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3835},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3835},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3835},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3835},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3835},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3835},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3835},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3835},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3835},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3835}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.32},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.32},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.32},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.94,"local_amount":2145,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2196.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123952553,"comment":null},{"amount":314.93,"local_amount":21835,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":22359.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128985536,"comment":null},{"amount":240.87,"local_amount":16700,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":17101.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136711347,"comment":null},{"amount":163.26,"local_amount":11320,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T07:50:09Z","rounded_local_amount":11592.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144997902,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-29T10:36:47Z","paid_date":"2010-06-17T07:50:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172522,"name":"Blanca Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La   Se\u00f1ora Blanca Rosa Garc\u00eda, Labora como Afanadora en la Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de Nicaragua, ella es casado  tiene un hijo a su cargo este se encuentran en edad escolar, ha trabajado un cr\u00e9ditos con CEPRODEL durante un a\u00f1o, en este periodo de tiempo ha invertido un cr\u00e9dito en la mejoramiento de la vivienda en la que habita, gracias a los financiamiento otorgados por CEPRODEL.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito solicitado es para invertir en la  Construcci\u00f3n de un cuarto de habitaci\u00f3n por lo que comprara materiales de construcci\u00f3n como: varios pliegos de zinc  para el techo, piedra, cemento.\n\n\n","en":"Blanca Rosa Garc\u00eda works as a janitor at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua.

He lives alone in his own home and what he desires most is to succeed and improve his quality of life. At 17, he decided to study dentistry in college and has since started his own practice so that he could help people in need. His practice is very close to one of the most important markets in his city, and currently serves many people, whom, because of his location, are mostly merchants. \r\n<p>\r\nOn the other hand, what he likes most about his work is serving those who really need his services, so that he may give them all his attention. He has been in this line of work for 10 years and considers the most difficult part to be treating children because they cry a lot and many times this breaks his concentration. Still, he knows that this is the job he chose and he is ready to continue working hard to be able to succeed.

She lives in her own home with her 45-year old husband Mariano and their two children, Yesenia (14 years) and Rolando (3 years).  The children are the reason for all their hard work.\r\n\r\nA year ago, with the savings Marcelina had managed to accumulate from her restaurant, she was able to buy a bus which she put to work immediately as local transport. Although the bus generates a good income, Marcelina knows that she can't set aside the restaurant which has also helped her improve her quality of life. So she still continues to please her customers with the delicious food she prepares.\r\n\r\nWhat she most enjoys about her work is the cooking which she does with much care. She\u2019s been doing this work for six years. The most difficult part is finding the time to serve her customers as the restaurant is almost always full. In the future she hopes to better equip the restaurant as she wants to provide her customers with better service. \r\n\r\nThis is Marcelina\u2019s third loan with Kiva partner MFP.

She has been doing this for 17 years.  She considers having to stay at her stand all day taking care of her business the most difficult part of the job since there are always people who wait for the opportunity to take something without paying when she is not looking.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Santa wants to have her own store where she can more easily sell her products and offer better service to her customers. \r\n\r\nThis is Santa's fifth loan with MFP.

O. has a bookstore where she sells useful school supplies such as notebooks, backpacks, ballpoint pens, etc.  She will use this loan to buy more school supplies.  Now that we are at the beginning of the school year, demand for these types of products increases considerably, so she must increase her inventory to be able to satisfy current demand.  She began this business five years ago.  She worked as an assistent in the general services area of a university, and her salary was enough to allow her to ask for a loan from our microcredit institution.  With the loan she bought a small stock of school supplies and a photocopier, with which she offered a copy service.\r\n\r\nShe is a single mother, and she must run the business and take care of her two children, a 7-year-old girl and a 9-year-old boy, who both attend primary school.  This client has had her business for 5 years, and she and her two children depend on it.  She offers this service all year, and January is an opportune time for her.  With this loan, she hopes to increase her inventory and expand her business.  That way, she will improve her sales now that the school year has started.  This will help her to increase her income, which will allow her to give her children the opportunity to have other choices and chances for their studies and for development in their lives.\r\n\r\nShe has worked with us for 5 years and 5 credit cycles.  The loans have been very important to her, since they allowed her to improve her work activities.

She lives in the house that one of her family members has ceded to her, and what she wants most is to improve the quality of her life.\n\nHer work is artisanal knitting, which she does both by hand and by machine. She has carried out this activity since she was 12 years old, when she helped her parents complete their orders. For the past 4 years, she has had her own handicraft workshop where she makes sweaters, scarves, hats, gloves, etc., garments that she sells on the weekends at her location on the seasonal Laguna esplanade (the place where they have markets in the city of Juliaca), where she waits on her clients with great pleasure. \n\nWhat she likes most about her work is talking with her customers and advising them on the garments that suit them best. The most difficult part of her work is remaining all day at her sales location, since she has to take care of it. Even so, she knows that she has to work very hard to reach her goals. With time, she hopes to increase her business and have a bigger store of handmade clothing.\n\nThis is Virginia's first loan with MFP, and she hopes to be punctual in her payments, since she doesn't want to damage the reputation of the other members of her community bank, where she is well-liked and respected. With the loan of 500 PEN she is applying for, she will buy more wool to increase the number of garments completed.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":479588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","use":"Buy wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-29T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":83.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960296,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":83.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993140,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":83.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717926,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":83.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751600,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":83.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934068,"comment":null},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":85.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672845,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-29T15:46:44Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172559,"name":"Isaack","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isaack is a 25-year-old single man.

El sabe que contar con una vaca m\u00e1s es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo pero dice que si quiere sacar a su familia adelante y brindarles todo lo necesario  tiene que esforzarse en producir m\u00e1s ya que la producci\u00f3n de leche es la que le genera mayores  ingresos a su familia.\n\nDon Ubaldo es socio de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores Agr\u00edcolas Ramonenses, una de las 100 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica. Este ser\u00e1 su segundo pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico adem\u00e1s de participar activamente en la organizaci\u00f3n de cr\u00e9dito en su comunidad. \n","en":"Ubaldo F. R.  is a 44-year-old gentleman that lives with his wife and 4 children in a community called San Ram\u00f3n de SantaTeresita de Turrialba, Province of Carttago.  It is a small rural community.  Its settlers are dedicated to the production of milk, agriculture especially of coffee and  bananas and also the raising of hogs.  It has an irregular terrain and a lot of the land is preserved as a humid tropical forest.  \r\n\r\nDon Ubaldo has been dedicated to the production of milk for approximately 3 years and at this time desires to obtain a micro-loan of 600,000 colones (six hundred thousand Costa Rican currency) to buy another dairy cow and thus to enlarge his production.  He knows that to add one more cow is a greater sacrifice and will demand more work,  but he says that, if he wants his family to get ahead and to offer them all that is needed, he has to be hard-working in producing more, since the production of milk is the thing that generates greater income for his family.  \r\n\r\nDon Ubaldo is an associate of the Association of Agricultural Producers of Ram\u00f3n , one of the 100 associate organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his second loan and with it he expects to continue growing on an economic and personal level,  besides participating actively in the credit organization in his community.  \r\n\r\n<br

Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. have faced difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions like ACCION USA support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education, as well. <P>\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":479656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"Hotdog

Together with her husband they have formed their own businesses. Her business is selling clothes, shoes, purses, cosmetics, and hats. She also has a local store; she sells pharmaceuticals and other things in her home. She started this business with the sale of some land in Esteli and she started to sell trout. Later she came to the capital and opened the store. With the loans from Afodenic she has been able to open the clothing store. At the beginning it was difficult for her since she was washing and ironing and everything to support her husband. They were hard times because it was exhausting. But thank God she was able to sell and everything improved in her life as well as her family's. With the support of the institution, she has been able to develop. With this money she wishes to buy school clothes such as: skirts, pants, socks, and school supplies.

The members of this group of 7 women are engaged in many varied productive activities including: food sales, a corner store, chicken rearing, bread making, and sewing. They have formed a strong bond with one another. It is apparent that these women regard community, solidarity, and hard work as values central to their beliefs. <P>\r\n\r\nTheir special bond has developed because the members of the group have been neighbours all their lives, and thus know each other on a very deep and personal level. The positive experience that this group has had throughout the duration of their first loan has inspired new members to join the group. This will be the group's second loan with Fundacion Mujer; the first loan was paid back on time and in full. The loan officer who has been working with this group commends the members on their strong history of punctual repayments.<P>\r\n\r\nSocorro P. V. is experienced in sales. Every day, she makes \u201cpan\u201d a type of bread that she sells fresh to her neighbours and others in her community. Socorro also sews women's clothes (underwear and blouses) which she sells on the weekends in Guapiles. She travels by bus with her clothing products, taking a combination of 3 buses. Guapiles, in the Carribean region of Costa Rica, is roughly 2 hours away. Socorro has lived in Poas her entire life. At the age of 54 she is one of the eldest in the group, and she takes pride in the level of trust that has always existed in her community. \u201cThere is no trouble,\u201d she says, \u201cif anyone makes trouble it\u2019s because they come from outside of our community.\u201d Her enthusiasm for life is inspiring; she says that every day is a gift.<P>\r\n\r\nAngela R. L. is the elected president of the group. She is 57 years old and has 8 children. Angela has a business sewing and selling clothes such as pants for men and women, children\u2019s clothing, shirts, and pyjamas. She also sews quilts and other types of bedding.<P>\r\n\r\nYorleny M. P. raises chickens and then sells the eggs they lay. She is 34 years old and lives with her four children. With her first loan, she made the mistake of buying the wrong feed for her chicks, so they ended up too fat to lay eggs. As a result, she has sold these chickens and plans to use this second loan to purchase the correct feed so that she might have some chickens that lay eggs. Yorleny has thankfully maintained a good sense of humour regarding her mistake.<P>\r\n\r\nVera Maria S. Z. is 43 years old and has 3 children. She has a business preparing and selling foods to people in her community. She works out of her home Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Vera makes the majority of her sales in the afternoons and at night. She sells hamburgers, tacos, and 'ceviche' among other products. She says her tacos are the most popular item on the menu. <P>\r\n\r\nLaura Espinoza R. is 32 years old. She has one child and her highest level of formal education is the completion of primary school. Laura runs a beauty salon where she employs one other person.

S. tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su c\u00f3nyuge y tiene 2 hijos en edades 8 y 6 a\u00f1os en el barrio El Carmen de Malambo, Municipio del \u00c1rea Metropolitana de Barranquilla y pueblo anfibio del  departamento del Atl\u00e1ntico, nacido a orillas del r\u00edo Magdalena y la Ci\u00e9naga Grande, en \u00e9l que sobreviven las danzas y ritos derivadas de la \u00e9poca de esclavitud en el Atl\u00e1ntico Colombiano, como la Cumbia, el Fandango, La Danza De Negro, La Danza De Los Pajaritos y El Gavil\u00e1n Pio-pio. \nComo en el interior de Malambo sus habitantes no suelen transportarse en taxi, el transporte p\u00fablico se efect\u00faa principalmente en moto taxi, una moto con sillas para dos pasajeros, que pasa por la puerta de la casa de Yadira, ubicada en esta v\u00eda principal, lo cual hace que ella est\u00e9 bien posicionada en su negocio de venta de aceite para motos, debido a que sus clientes principales son los conductores de moto taxi y a que las cortas distancias al interior de Malambo, hacen que la  poblaci\u00f3n utilice este tipo de transporte y hacen de ella una actividad  muy rentable. \nAunque Yadira siempre tuvo un negocio, se inici\u00f3 con la venta de aceites para motos, cuando fu\u00e8 felizmente involucrada  por su prima quien se mud\u00f3 hace cuatro a\u00f1os y se lo dej\u00f3; ella accedi\u00f3 teniendo en cuenta que su casa era el sitio perfecto para comercializar este producto por la  alta circulaci\u00f3n de estos veh\u00edculos, para ello su padre abri\u00f3 un local para su funcionamiento. Ella dice que tiene una ventaja competitiva en este negocio porque es una poblaci\u00f3n que ha aumentado mucho y este crecimiento significa un aumento en el n\u00famero de personas que van transportados por los moto taxis y por consiguiente aumenta la demanda de aceite; adicionalmente tiene una habitaci\u00f3n en su casa dedicada a los videojuegos donde ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes del Municipio pueden divertirse, este lo trajo una cu\u00f1ada de Bucaramanga y aunque en el barrio hay mucha competencia, sus equipos son m\u00e1s modernos y ninguna otra sala de videojuegos del municipio tiene los X-Box. As\u00ed que la rotaci\u00f3n del dinero diario por este concepto lo hace bien atractivo para ella y su familia.\nElla solicita un pr\u00e9stamo por valor de  $2.000.000 para comprar aceite y comprar una reja y mejorar la cubierta de la sala de videojuegos lo cual servir\u00e1 para aumentar la seguridad. \u00c9ste es el segundo cr\u00e9dito, efectuado a Yadira por la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  entidad a la que le gusta pertenecer, porque considera que  otras organizaciones hacen muchas deducciones, lo que significa que reciben menos dinero; en la Fundaci\u00f3n recibe financiaci\u00f3n de acuerdo de su capacidad de pago. Es m\u00e1s, Yadira  expresa que aprovecha muy bien los cursos y programas formativos que  le ofrecen el la Fundaci\u00f3n y est\u00e1 decidida a  ponerlos en pr\u00e1ctica en el negocio. Con esta actividad apoya los ingresos de la familia y  se siente contenta pues puede enviar a su hija a una escuela de ballet.\nYadira M., dice que su mayor desaf\u00edo personal que enfrenta es la salud de su c\u00f3nyuge porque tuvo que asumir la direcci\u00f3n y parte de los gastos de la familia cuando  \u00e9l se enferm\u00f3, pero por suerte tiene la seguridad social cubierta, porque en este pa\u00eds le prestan todos los servicios a \u00e9l. La meta de su familia es construir un almac\u00e9n de repuestos e insumos para las motos en un lote al lado de su casa, pero aun  sue\u00f1a con tener un local propio e independiente de sus padres y por eso abri\u00f3 una cuenta de ahorros para seguir guardando sus ingresos y as\u00ed poder hacerlo.\n\n\n","en":"Yadira Esther M. S. is 37 years old and lives with her husband and two children (ages 8 and 6) in the neighborhood of El Carmen de Malambo, which is in the metropolitan area of the City of Barranquilla, Department of Atl\u00e1ntico.  The city lies on the banks of Magdalena River and the Great Marsh.  Many of the dances and rituals derived from days of slavery still survive in the Colombian Atlantic region such as the Cumbia, the Fandango, \u201cLa Danza de Negro\u201d (The Black Dance), \u201cLa Danza de Los Pajaritos\u201d (The Dance of the Small Birds) and \u201cEl Gavil\u00e1n Pio-pio\u201d (The Cry of the Hawk).  Within the interior region of Malambo, the inhabitants rarely travel by taxi.  The primary mode of transportation is a \u201cmototaxi\u201d, which is a motorcycle with seats for two passengers.  When you come across the front door of Yadira\u2019s house, which is located on the main road, you will find a strategically located business for selling motorcycle oil.  Her main customers are motorcycle taxi drivers who travel short distances within Malambo.  Most of the population utilize this method of transportation, so it can be a very profitable business.\r\n<p>\r\nEven though she already had a business, Yadira decided to begin selling motorcycle oil with her cousin.  The cousin moved away four years ago and she agreed to take over the business entirely.  Her house was the perfect place for selling this type of product because of the high frequency of motorcycle traffic, so her father set aside a space for her to run the business.  Yadira says she has a competitive advantage in her business because of the significant increase in the population.  This type of growth means more people are traveling by motorcycle taxi, which leads to an increase in the demand for oil.  In addition, Yadira has a room in her house where children and teenagers from the neighborhood can come to play video games and have fun.  Her sister-in-law brought in the equipment from Bucaramanga.  Even though Yadira faces stiff competition from other video arcades in town, her equipment is more modern and her business is the only place in the area that has an X-Box.  This particular business was attractive because of the daily income it generates for her and her family. \r\n<p>\r\nYadira is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 COP to buy motorcycle oil and security bars to install in her video game room to provide more safety.  This is her second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an institution which she enjoys doing business with because she noticed that other organizations made several deductions that decreased the loan amount issued.  With the Foundation, she is able to receive the full amount requested.  In addition, Yadira says that she taken several good courses offered by the Foundation and is determined to implement them in her business.  With her business activities, she is able to provide income for her family and is happy that she is able to send her daughter to ballet classes.\r\n<p>\r\nYadira says the biggest personal challenge she faces is the health of her husband because she had to take charge of the family expenses when he became ill.  Fortunately, she receives payments from the government because in her country she is able to access services that her husband needs. Yadira\u2019s goal for her family is to build a warehouse next to her home where she can sell parts and supplies for motorcycles.  She still dreams of having a home separate from her parents, so she has opened a savings account to set aside the funds needed to achieve this goal.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Chynar lives in the city of Balykchi together with her family.  Balykchi used to be included among the fast-growing cities in the republic.  Many multi-story buildings were built here, factories were operating, and the city was also known for its fishing industry.  However, recent years of economic decline did their deed.  Manufacturing stopped, and the citizens started leaving the city.  It was difficult for Chynar because she still had to raise four children.  Her husband and she decided to stay and find work in the city.  Soon, Chynar was able to get involved in retail sales at the market.  She started selling flour and livestock feed.  Chynar\u2019s husband began working as a taxi driver.  Now, they successfully continue raising their children.  The oldest daughter is in her first year of school.  The second daughter is a college student.  Their eight-year-old son already started school.  And the youngest son, who is six, is home for now.  Chynar achieved a lot during the fifteen years in her business.  Together with her husband, she was able to purchase a house in order to organize a retail outlet there.  She was also able to buy a car.  Currently, her monthly income from flour sales and livestock feed ranges from 10,000 som ($220) to 15,000 som ($340).  The oldest daughters have already grown up and actively help their mother with the sales after school.  Now, Chynar needs a loan.  She is hoping to obtain a loan in order to increase goods turnover and purchase of 10 bags of flour and 15 bags of livestock feed.  In the future, Chynar wants to expand the business and open a food market.\r\n\r\nChynar\u2019s partners in this group are:\r\n\r\nKuluypa D. is fifty-seven years old.  Her husband is retired.  Together they raised one son.  Kuluypa also stays at home and relies solely on her pension for income.  She has wanted to purchase a washing machine for a long time; however, it will take her some time to save money for this purchase.  This is why she is hoping to obtain this loan.\r\n\r\nAynabu T. is forty-three years old.  Her husband works as a driver for one company.  Aynabu has two children.  One of the sons works as an electrician.  The second one is only two years old.  Aynabu prepares \u201cbozo\u201d (a traditional drink) and sells it to stores.  She needs a loan in order to purchase a kitchen set.\r\n\r\nRoza I. is fifty-seen years old.  She is involved in animal husbandry.  She currently has one cow with a calf and seven sheep.  Roza\u2019s husband is a physics teacher at a secondary school.  Roza requested this loan in order to buy one more cow with a calf for raising.  She wants to finish building her house and, to achieve this goal, she needs to own as much livestock for sale as possible.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":479810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Increasing turnover by purchasing 10 bags of flour and 15 bags of livestock feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Balykchi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-01-29T22:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chynar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuluyapa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aynabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":49000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":9181},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9481},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9790},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10109},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10439}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.1},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":210.79,"local_amount":9181,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:46:57Z","rounded_local_amount":9322.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123957026,"comment":null},{"amount":217.67,"local_amount":9481,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":9627.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989837,"comment":null},{"amount":224.77,"local_amount":9790,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":9941.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715647,"comment":null},{"amount":232.1,"local_amount":10109,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10265.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748496,"comment":null},{"amount":239.67,"local_amount":10439,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":10600.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931470,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-30T01:35:05Z","paid_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172636,"name":"Balyesiima Group, Mpigi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

is a 31-year-old entrepreneur from the western coastal city of Mombasa. He runs a store, which on one side has general retail items like sugar, rice, and beans, and on the other side has vegetables. He is seeking a loan for KSH 40,000 to restock his store with rice, beans and sugar and continue selling vegetables, something he really loves doing. Omar employs one other person and is located in a commercial area, serving the residents of the Manjego and Kingorani dwellers. His biggest challenges are competition from other stores, racism and tribalism. \r\n\r\nOmar has had this store for five years. He also runs a \"boda-boda\" or motorcycle taxi business.

is 62 years old and married, with seven adult children. She has a farm in the Murang'a area of the Central Province of Kenya and she's been farming for over twenty years. She's a pig farmer but also earns some income from mixed farming. She says that the major challenges to her business are a lack of funds to buy animal feed and improve her pig sty.<P>\r\n\r\nShe requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo for Kes. 48,920. She'll use 45,000 to buy pigs and the remaining 3,920 to subscribe to the medical aid that Juhudi offers its clients. <P>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Annah hopes to improve and expand her pig sty so that it can hold more than fifty pigs. Through more investment in her pig farm, she believes she'll be able to eventually improve her homestead with a better house. She hopes that she can continue to be a Juhudi client, since she requires more assets to achieve her goal. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout Juhudi Kilimo<P>\r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is a for-profit social enterprise focused on the economic development of Kenya. It has a unique approach to financing agribusiness value chains, from production of raw products to processing and delivery of goods: by providing asset financing and technical assistance funding to smallholder farmers and rural enterprises.

A., 42 years old, married, is a member of Ginoong Sanay center of Rizal South Branch (RSB). She is also an active member of her group and center. She lives in a coastal place called Talim Island, Binangonan, Rizal, Philippines. The couple is blessed with an only child, Jennilyn A.,  a 9-year-old grade III student. Like many families, they want to uplift themselves and get away from poverty. They come from poor families themselves and they want a better life for their child.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, she joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, to obtain working capital to her primary business fishing. Now on her third loan, she requests 15,000 PHP to start hog-fattening as her secondary source of income. The loan funds will be used to purchase 4 piglets, feed, vitamins and pay transportation expenses. The remaining money will also be used to reconstruct her fishing business which was destroyed by typhoon \u201dOndoy\u201d.<P>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Gloria wants to invest in their own pump boat. She hopes to have success with both businesses in order to provide quality education for her child until she finishes college. Gloria also enjoys seeing that the loan from ASHI and KIVA will change their lives and gradually allow her to touch her dreams.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":479918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To pay for

R. is from the village of Parog Parog, Solana, Cagayan. She is 58 years old. Dolores is widowed and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, Dolores owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Dolores has been engaged in her business for over 40 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Dolores joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Dolores has successfully repaid a previous loan of 22,000 PHP from ASKI. Dolores is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Dolores from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of their family.\n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Janobiddin was very young he has been part of an agriculture business. He has gained a lot of experience in this business as he has always helped out a lot with the cultivation of crops in his home community of Isfara, Tajikistan. Now he is the father of three adult children. Nowadays Janobiddin has managed to improve his family\u2019s economic situation thanks to the help brought to him by IMON International through a loan that he has used directly for his agricultural business. On this occasion Janobiddin is seeking IMON International\u2019s help so that he can benefit from improved technical assistance in his farming - so that, when harvest time comes around, he can improve his economic situation. Please support this father so his effort is worthwhile. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

I. is married with three children. This is an average size family in Isfara, Tajikistan. However, Ilhom is also a unique entrepreneur. Together with his wife, he has been selling blankets, towels, shawls and other things at the central city market for about 6 years. The secret of his success is simple: not only does he let his customers know the benefits of his products,  he also gives them a sense of relationship which brings them back again and again. However, he doesn\u2019t want to stop where he is at with his venture. Ilhom is seeking a loan of $1000 USD to re-stock the merchandise in his store. We believe that Ilhom\u2019s desire to excel in pleasing his customers will determine his further success and encourage new customers to buy from him.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

O. is 48 years old. She and her husband raised 4 children. Ten years ago, Mohira learned how to embroider the national skull-cap for men and women, and now she run her own business. She works really hard, getting up very early and going to bed very late, selling the skull-caps at the local market. Mohira dreams of arranging the marriage of her son. With this purpose in mind, Mohira is planning to expand her business. She is requesting a loan of $800 USD. Mohira is planning to spend the loan on purchasing materials for embroidering. Mohira had shown herself to be a reliable client of IMON. Let\u2019s get behind this dedicated mother to make her dream become reality.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Avazmat was born in 1964 and is married with two children. As an aspiring and hard-working man he has always dreamed of achieving success in whatever he does. Thus, when he joined IMON International, he was able to make a lot of progress with his previous loan, which he invested mostly in crop farming. Then, he saw a new business opportunity: rearing young cattle, which is very profitable because of the constant demand for meat at the market. Given this loan, Avazmat will purchase young cattle and feed for them to expand his business. He plans to use the profits from his business to educate his children, improve the structure of his home, and improve the standard of living of his family.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

To support his family, he has to invest in his livestock business and, consequently, he's approached IMON International to apply for a loan that will allow him to purchase young cattle and feed for them and, in turn, increase his income from the milk, meat, horn, etc. that cattle provide.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

D. C. is an active woman who lives in the neighborhood of Buenos Aires.  She enjoys Carnival season, the time of year when a picturesque atmosphere sets the background for the most important cultural festival in the city.  The <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barranquilla_Carnival\" target=\"_blank\" >Carnival of Barranquilla<\/a> is also one of the happiest occasions in Colombia.  Its popular and carefree style reflects the youthful spirit and creativity of the people of Barranquilla, making it an essential part of the Caribbean.\r\n<p>  \r\nOnce the Christmas holidays are over, Elva Mar\u00eda and her daughter begin organizing her home business with all the decorations pertaining to Carnival, a mixture of the modern with the more traditional type that reflects the event\u2019s origins.  The tradition of Carnival was brought to the Americas from Spain and continues to promote the spirit of renewal and change that inspired this holiday season in Europe.\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to being known for her cheerful personality, Elva Mar\u00eda is an enterprising woman who prepares snacks such as fried foods maD. of flour, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arepa\" target=\"_blank\" >arepas<\/a> (flatbread served with various fillings or toppings), and cariba\u00f1olas (dumplings maD. of cassava and potato dough, stuffed with meat and vegetables).  She sells these snacks to stores and individually to neighbors in her area.  Elva Mar\u00eda also has a retail shop in her home that is stocked with stationery and various seasonal accessories worn by women and girls.\r\n<p>\r\nHer snack business was a tradition passed on to her by her mother, who also prepared these same products for sale.  Elva Mar\u00eda has added the most delicious desserts to her offerings, as she loves the art of cooking.  She also sells <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sancocho\" target=\"_blank\" >sancocho<\/a> (a traditional soup), but she noticed that many people in the neighborhood started prospering, so she suspended selling food temporarily so that she could open and organize the retail shop in her home.  When this business started, her husband Joaquin C. traveled frequently for work since he was employed by a shipping company.  Running a home business helped to make her feel that she was not alone.  Today, her husband is retired and enjoys a peaceful and happy life.\r\n<p>\r\nElva Mar\u00eda has received three previous loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and has repaid them all on time.  She used the proceeds to purchase miscellaneous goods and supplies for preparing food at different times of the year:  Christmas, Carnival season, Easter, etc.  With the profits generated by her business, she has managed to make repairs and modifications to her home because her husband\u2019s pension was used to pay for the completion of the work.  This freed up her income to devote on other expenses such as food and services.  Their joint incomes have also contributed to the success of her business.  Her next loan in the amount of 2,000,000 COP will be used to stock her store with school supplies.  She also plans to sell drinks, such as delicious and healthy juices, and popsicles maD. with milk and fruit and packed in plastic bags.  Her customers will soon be able to taste these delightful treats in order to cool down from the high temperatures experienced on the Coast.\r\n<p>\r\nElva Mar\u00eda\u2019s goal for her family in the midterm is to acquire a place at a commercial site so that she can use her home for storing the display cases that hold the merchandise displayed before customers.  Her short-term goal is to buy a hot dog cart with a canopy; a bread and sausage steamer; inserts with lids for keeping onions, cheese, and potatoes; stainless steel containers for holding sauces; and an interior cupboard for storing bread.   These items will be installed at the entrance of her business, which is already known for selling food and hosting the most anticipated costume party for the residents of the neighborhood, the famous \u201cLunes D. Carnaval\u201d that occurs on the third day of Carnival season.   The party starts with the appearance of a large pick-up truck equipped with a sound box, six loudspeakers, two columns, three machines, eight transistors, an equalizer, and a three CD disk changer.  The group \u201cEl Millo\u201d begins the festivities with traditional Caribbean folk music.  In this district of Barranquilla, this annual neighborhood tradition is now known as \u201cthe Party with the Cuetos\u201d, named after Elva Mar\u00eda\u2019s family.  The attendees of this great rumba festival only pay for the food and beverages offered by Elva Mar\u00eda, so she is able to enjoy the party and still earn a little money.<br \/><p><strong>Translated

is 50 years old and lives with his wife and their two children. He has the best intentions for his children and this allows him to continue improving as a father and farmer.\r\n\r\nAvaz is a man who, from an early age, was characterized as a hard-worker who is very dedicated to his agricultural work raising cattle. He saw this as an activity that would enable him to have additional income due to the high demand for these animals in the markets. His son (pictured) is also engaged in this business.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is to improve the breed but in order to do so, Avaz must feed them properly. This farmer yearns to expand his business so that he will be able to improve his family\u2019s standard of living. In order to do so he is asking for a loan which will allow him to buy animals of a better breed in order to improve their quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Barcel\u00f3 is 25 years old and lives in the neighborhood of Tajamares, which is part of the city of Soledad near BarranquilL..  He operates a barber shop in a small rented space adorned with many touches of Afro-Colombian culture that represent his African heritage and childhood influences growing up in an Afro-Colombian neighborhood.  His services are so much in demand that he often has a line of customers waiting in the barber shop or out in the street.  His customers are mostly young people, so in order to make the wait more enjoyable, Leonardo is requesting a loan of 1,300,000 COP to buy a sound system, television, a mirror, a speaker, and pay to have a small lavatory installed.  All of these items are needed to attract more customers.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Leonardo was much younger, there were three men living at home:  his father, his brother, and himself.  They cut each other\u2019s hair.  His father, who receives an old age pension, thought of what things are needed to start a barber shop, so he bought an electric shaver.  Leonardo started cutting hair for relatives and next-door neighbors.  Once he perfected his technique, he began charging 1000 COP.  Over time, people from the block approached him about starting a home service, which he did in 2002.  Later on, in 2008, he started renting his own location.\r\n<p>\r\nLeonardo studied computer programming and analysis, but he decided not to pursue this field because he enjoys being a barber.  He is a hard worker who bought each of his tools as a result of his efforts.  His work schedule is from 8am until 10pm and has not changed.  He is known for being a friendly conversationalist.  \r\n<p>\r\nLeonard is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for increasing his line of credit.  The loans from FMSD replaced the ones he obtained from informal moneylenders, who charged high rates that left him earning nothing.  His goal is to learn English because Colombia is visited by foreigners, mainly North Americans and Italians, especially during Carnival season.  He wants to develop better communication skills and take advantage of opportunities in the global market.  Leonardo also dreams of having a larger space so that he can hire employees to proviD. manicures, pedicures, and women\u2019s haircuts.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":475753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber Shop","sector":"Services","use":"Install a small lavatory & purchase sound equipment, television, speaker, and mirror for his waiting area","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-01-30T03:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonardo Fabio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":86543},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":98277},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100324},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":102414},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":104548},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":106726},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":108949},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":111219},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":113536},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":115901},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":118316},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":133247}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.02},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.1},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.41},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.57},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.18},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.43},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.94,"local_amount":86543,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":89336.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949022,"comment":null},{"amount":51.02,"local_amount":98277,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":101448.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677814,"comment":null},{"amount":52.1,"local_amount":100324,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:01Z","rounded_local_amount":103561.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712187,"comment":null},{"amount":53.17,"local_amount":102414,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":105719.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895693,"comment":null},{"amount":54.29,"local_amount":104548,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:56Z","rounded_local_amount":107922.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636016,"comment":null},{"amount":55.42,"local_amount":106726,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":110170.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172116889,"comment":null},{"amount":56.57,"local_amount":108949,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":112465.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410754,"comment":null},{"amount":176.87,"local_amount":340656,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":351650.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688020,"comment":null},{"amount":130.62,"local_amount":251563,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":259681.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000682,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-30T07:31:46Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172768,"name":"Couronne Plus Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cCouronne Plus\u201d is a group of 32 owners of small businesses chaired by Patience.

En este momento el \u00fanico capital que soportaba este segundo negocio era el producido por los bolis y casi siempre se quedaba corta en responder con mercanc\u00edas a sus clientes; fue entonces cuando Ana, su vecina y amiga, percibiendo su capacidad emprendedora y su ya reconocido sentido de responsabilidad en el barrio, le recomend\u00f3 acercarse a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo para que la apoyaran con un cr\u00e9dito y desde entonces no ha dejado de participar en los programas de esta entidad, ella reconoce que este ha sido un capital adicional que ha mejorado su oferta de productos en cantidad y en calidad.\n  \nA Patricia siempre le ha gustado ser independiente, su c\u00f3nyuge es polic\u00eda y  tienen dos hijos menores de edad; su esposo y su cu\u00f1ada que es docente, le ayudan a seleccionar sus clientela entre sus amigos de trabajo es decir los que mejor pagan;  ella tambi\u00e9n compra calzado, prendas de plata, oro golfi, electrodom\u00e9sticos que no est\u00e1n en la gu\u00eda de productos y que le piden sus clientes; esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual ellos la prefieren y su negocio se ha extendido, ya que siempre les vende lo que estos le encargan; su actual aspiraci\u00f3n es obtener un cr\u00e9dito por valor de $2.000.000 para comprar prendas de plata y de oro a solicitud  de los mas rentables.\n\nPara esta joven mujer, el tener un negocio le ha fortalecido su car\u00e1cter independiente, con sus utilidades ella paga la seguridad social y puede incluir a sus padres; tiene una hermosa  y ordenada vivienda, producto del inter\u00e9s de su esposo y  de ella por vivir cada d\u00eda mejor; ha logrado tambi\u00e9n hacer optimas adecuaciones en su casa, como los pisos, la puerta, los closets; le encanta su esposo porque \u00e9l no limita su capacidad de so\u00f1ar ni sus decisiones de inversi\u00f3n, pues \u00e9l reconoce que todo le da un resultado exitoso. \n\nPatricia H. es una mujer polifac\u00e9tica, ama el trabajo que realiza, por eso tambi\u00e9n participa en actividades, que apoyan la seguridad alimentaria de familias pobres y estimulan el mejoramiento y la recuperaci\u00f3n en los niveles de nutrici\u00f3n de ni\u00f1os con dificultades alimenticias o expuestos a ella; all\u00ed de la mano de una organizaci\u00f3n ubicada cerca de su vivienda, realiza  acciones formativas y ense\u00f1a a identificar como conseguir alimentos a madres y personas responsables de menores en riesgo alimentario; ha participado en programas de siembra de huertas en los patios de familias especiales,  labores mencionadas con la que obtiene algunos ingresos adicionales que fortalecen  el desarrollo  familiar, pues su sue\u00f1o est\u00e1 proyectado en ofrecer estudios profesionales y especializados a sus hijos y respecto a su negocio planea desarrollar una infraestructura s\u00f3lida que le permita desde su vivienda tener  exhibidores y contratar personas a las que pueda pagar un salario que beneficie a su familia.\nUno de los retos que ha enfrentado fue cuando se presentaron problemas de salud en su familia y  se qued\u00f3 sin capital teniendo que empezar nuevamente;  Patricia H. es una excelente miembro de familia, conciente de sus obligaciones morales y con una gran capacidad de riesgo calculado que hacen de ella una mujer con una enorme proyecci\u00f3n futura.\n\n","en":"In the July 20th neighborhood tenement, there is a place near the Metropolitan Stadium in Barranquilla where soccer games are played and the neighbors are happy and supportive of one another.  This place is the neighborhood where Patricia H. A. lives.  She is 32 years old and has enjoyed being independent from a young age.  Patricia started a home business making popsicles and frozen drinks packed in plastic bags.  Her products are prepared naturally and consist of the most delicious tropical fruits of the region including guava, mango, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Soursop\" target=\"_blank\" >soursop<\/a>, coconut, banana, and pineapple.  By serving these refreshments, Patricia became known in the community and gradually attracted business before she was presented with an opportunity to start selling general merchandise through specialized guides.  She eventually started her new retail business in which she visited customers to demonstrate the products shown in the catalog prior to taking their orders.  Patricia delivers the goods to the homes of her customers and started offering credit payment plans that require an initial down payment.  At the moment, her only source of capital for this second business comes from selling popsicles.  However, she was always short of the funds needed to fulfill her customers\u2019 orders.  It was at this point that Ana, a friend and neighbor, took note of her entrepreneurship and suggested that she visit Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for a loan.  Since then, she has continued to participate in the programs offered by the organization.  The additional capital issued to Patricia has improved both the quantity and quality of her product offerings.\r\n<p>\r\nPatricia\u2019s husband is a policeman and they have two dependent children.  Her sister-in-law is a teacher and helps find customers among her friends at work who are more likely to pay.  Patricia also sells shoes, silver plated ornaments, imitation gold, and appliances that are not offered in her product catalog but requested by her customers.  For this reason, her customers prefer to buy from her, which has led to an expansion of her business since Patricia is willing to sell them whatever they need.   Her current goal is to obtain a loan of 2,000,000 COP to buy silver and gold ornaments since these items are the most profitable.\r\n<p>\r\nFor Patricia, having a business means establishing her status as an independent woman.  With her earnings, she is able to pay Social Security so that she can support her parents and still maintain a beautiful and orderly home.  This is a by-product of the willingness of her and her husband to live a better life each day.  They have been able to make optimal improvements to their home by adding floors, doors, and closets.  Patricia loves her husband because he does not limit her ability to dream or make investment decisions.  He acknowledges that her choices have resulted in successful outcomes.\r\n<p>\r\nPatricia H. is a multifaceted woman.  She enjoys her work, but she also participates in activities that support the feeding of the poor and encourage improving the nutritional levels of children who do not have enough to eat.  Patricia lends a hand to an organization near her home that identifies mothers and guardians of children at risk and teaches them about proper nutrition.  She has participated in programs that plant gardens in the yards of families with special needs.  The revenue generated from this program goes to fund programs that strengthen family development.  Her dream is to provide specialized training to educators and other professionals who work with children.  As for her business, she wants to develop a solid program in which exhibitors can sell from their home and then hire employees and pay them a wage that will allow them to support their families.  One of the challenges she faces is the existence of health problems in her family.  She ran out of capital and is now having to rebuild.  Patricia is an integral member of her family who is aware of her moral obligations.  She has a great capacity for taking calculated risks necessary to map out her future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Garc\u00eda is 69 years old and has seven children who range in age from 35 to 50.  She lives in the neighborhood of Cachimbiro, which is an ancient indigenous settlement.  This area is known for the use of the \u201ccachimbo\u201d, a tobacco pipe maD. of ivory and wood maD. by native artists of Afro-Colombian origin.\r\n<p>\r\nNeila is a gracious woman who enjoys conversation.  At 69 years of age, she does not stop working because she wants to make improvements to her home on her own.  She plans to purchase new furniture and appliances because her current items need to be replaced because of constant use.  In order to earn money, Neila produces nurses\u2019 uniforms and bed linens through contracts and by direct request.  Her customers bring her the material and she takes measurements to determine the design of the uniform.  She also takes into consideration how the person wants to dress. \r\n<p>\r\nNeila has a sewing machine, but she still has to send out dresses for overlock stitching (in order to finish the edges).  She restarted this business four years ago.  Neila had stopped working in order to take care of her seven children and also her excessive schedule took a toll on her health.  In her previous business, she manufactured overalls and men\u2019s uniforms in mass quantity.  Now that her husband is retired and her children are working, Neila is more relaxed when she works.  She has no plans to quit because she has been sewing since she was 17 years old.  Prior to getting married, she studied dressmaking at an academy near her home.\r\n<p>  \r\nWith this second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, Neila will be able to restart her business.  She learned about the organization from a co-worker of her daughter, who is a nurse and the co-signer of this loan.  The proceeds in the amount of 2,000,000 COP will be used to buy an <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Overlock\" target=\"_blank\" >overlock stitching machine<\/a>, which will allow her to finish the seams of her garments without having to pay extra for this service.\r\n<p>\r\nThe income generated from Neila\u2019s apparel business enables her to maintain the home where she lives with her husband, who is a pensioner of Avianca (the national airline of Colombia).  One of her unmarried daughters also lives with them and helps with the expenses.  Her other children contribute as well.   In addition to replacing the furniture, Neila wants to buy some durable appliances, such as a washing machine, that will make her daily chores easier and her home more pleasant.  Neila has a very peaceful life.  She loves her family and her hometown of Soledad, which is nationally recognized for being the birthplace of \u201cbutifarra\u201d, a sausage of Catalan origin that is a specialty of Caribbean coastal cuisine. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

G. is 51 years old and a well-known beauty stylist in the Simon Bolivar neighborhood of the city of Barranquilla, which is considered to have one of the most comprehensive infrastructures.  It offers a wide range of services including shops, sports venues, places of worship, financial service institutions, and an extensive public transportation route.  The residents of the neighborhood are very proud that they were able to secure these amenities.  Five Colombians and three Germans had the idea to build a bridge between the coast and the Colombian interior.  This led to the start of Colombo-German Air Transport Society (or <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SCADTA\" target=\"_blank\" >SCADTA<\/a>), which later became Avianca, thereby making Barranquilla the birthplace of civil aviation in Latin America.\r\n<p> \r\nAdela studied nursing and then cosmetology.  She personally finds the beauty sector to be more satisfying personally.  Adela provides styling and aesthetic care services such as haircuts (for men, women, and children), manicures, and pedicures from her small location.  At the same time, she manages a public telephone service.  Everyone in her family participates in the business.  Her husband lost his job and started an independent messaging service while selling food.  They have five children between the ages of 17 and 31.  All of them attended school, but the three youngest children are still in college while the others are already working.  Adela is thankful that her children have the opportunity to pursue an education because her dream has always been for them to be independent, self-reliant, and self-sufficient, and an education has allowed them to achieve this goal.  She is requesting a loan to pay the college expenses of her daughter, who is studying in her fifth semester of Occupational Therapy and also helps with the family microenterprise activities.\r\n<p> \r\nAdela has been working with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for three years.  She learned about the organization from a one of her customers who she saw on a limited basis and suggested that she apply for a loan.  Adela is opposed to buying anything on credit, but now she can make cash purchases and also acquire supplies cheaper and in large quantities even though it may require spending more money.  As a stylist, she is able to sell hair products to her customers, which helps to grow her business.  She enjoys being a client of the Foundation because she has not experienced any problems and her loans have been manageable.  \r\n<p>\r\nAdela has not had many difficulties in her business because she experienced success from the very beginning.  It helps that her beauty shop is located in the Simon Bolivar neighborhood because of the number of passing vehicles and presence of heavy foot traffic from the commercial boulevard.  She is now planning to expand her salon because there is not enough space to accommodate more than one employee.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":478802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","use":"Pay for her daughter's college expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-01-30T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1783523,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":279162},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":289759},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":294589},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":299498},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":304490},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":316025}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.22},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.14},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.65},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":140.87,"local_amount":279162,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":280062.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949025,"comment":null},{"amount":146.22,"local_amount":289759,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":290693.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677816,"comment":null},{"amount":148.65,"local_amount":294589,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":295538.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712190,"comment":null},{"amount":151.14,"local_amount":299498,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":300463.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895695,"comment":null},{"amount":153.65,"local_amount":304490,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:03Z","rounded_local_amount":305471.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636019,"comment":null},{"amount":159.47,"local_amount":316025,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":317044.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850121,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-31T10:14:26Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172778,"name":"Alfredo Evelio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alfredo, desde que naci\u00f2 conoce perfectamente el t\u00e8rmino viceras,  es decir organo de Ganado para hacer los mas exquisitos platos de la comida colombiana,panza,corazon, higado, ri\u00f1ones y pulmon;   \u00e8l lo aprendi\u00f2 tradicionalmente de su padre de quien dice es el \u201cmondonguero mayor\u201d que significa vendedor de panza que montado en un asno ofrece estos productos. \nAlfredo como su padre tambien practica este oficio, pero ahora lo hace en un bicicoche donde ademas de hacer ejercicios,  gana dinero vendiendo viceras  recorriendo la zona  alrededor del barrio Galan de Barranquilla, sitio donde esta ubicada su vivienda. Trabaja como un experto  cortador  carnico,  tiene 12 a\u00f1os de haber iniciado su negocio y le gusta vender estos produtos porque con ellos se preparan los mas exquisitos platos de la comida colombiana: por ejemplo las sopas  de mondongo que es la sopa de panza cortada en cuadritos a la cual agregan papa, yuca maiz,veduras frescas , clavito de olor, sal al gusto y hasta pezu\u00f1a o medula de Ganado.\nEs usual para alfredo, vestirse con su bata blaca y gorra e ir diariamente al Mercado desde las 4:00 a.m. a comprar viceras en su bicicoche, luego recorre mas de 6 barrios con su cuchillo afilado,  2 neveras de polietireno , un balanza  y una Madera donde se afirma para cortar y vender por libras sus productos, porque Alfredo vende al detal a mas de 150 clientes diarios, algunos son atendidos por su padre que ya no va en asno, sino en un vehiculo similar al de \u00e8ste  y con quien divide la zona de trabajo.  Ellos dos son muy reconocidos  porque los clients saben que venden viceras de calidad , frescas y no los enga\u00f1an en el pesaje.\nEl dice que  conoci\u00f2 a la Fundaci\u00f2n  Mario Santo Domingo, o a la Mario como cari\u00f1osamente la llaman, porque todos en el barrio saben que tienen programas de credito, capacitaci\u00f2n y tambien de vivienda.

These include the stomach, heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs.  He learned this tradition from his father, who is known as \u201cEl Mondonguero Mayor\u201d (The Great Tripe Seller) and travels by donkey to sell his products.\r\n<p>\r\nAlfredo followed in his father\u2019s footsteps, except he uses a bicycle cart to sell his goods.  He earns his living traveling through the area near his home in the neighborhoods surrounding Galan de Barranquilla to sell internal organs.  Alfredo is known as an expert meat cutter and has been in this profession for twelve years.  He enjoys working with these products because they are staples in many of the dishes that make up Colombian cuisine.  For example, tripe is used in a lot of soups when combined with potatoes, cassava, corn, fresh vegetables, cloves, and salt to taste.  Some recipes even call for the hoof and bone marrow of the cow.    \r\n<p>\r\nAlfredo\u2019s usual schedule is to travel to the market every day at 4am, dressed in a white apron and cap, to buy internal organs to stock his bicycle cart.  Later he travels to more than six neighborhoods with his sharp knife, two styrofoam ice chests, a scale, and a butcher block so that he can begin cutting and selling his products by the pound.  Alfredo serves more than 150 customers each day, some of whom were previous patrons of his father.  Since Alfredo has his own mode of transportation, he and his father decided to divide the sales territory.  They both are well-recognized by their customers and known for the quality and freshness of their products.  In addition, they have an honest reputation since they don\u2019t cheat when weighing the goods.\r\n<p>\r\nAlfredo learned about Fundaci\u00f2n Mario Santo Domingo (or simply \u201cMario\u201d as he likes to call it) from everyone in the neighborhood because of the credit programs, training seminars, and housing services that it offers.  This is his second loan and he hopes to obtain financing of 1,000,000 COP to acquire more products for his business.  These include the meats that his customers request on a frequent basis as well as internal organs he plans to buy in bulk.  Alfredo lives in his father\u2019s home with his wife and their three daughters (age 15, 6, and 3 respectively).  His dream is to have his own house and see his children grow up to become independent and studious individuals.  For this reason, he and his wife strive daily on a personal level because they care deeply about their daughters\u2019 education.\r\n<p>\r\nAlfredo\u2019s greatest wish is to open a well-stocked vending location and hire employees to travel to different neighborhoods because his customers enjoy having his products delivered to their front door.  This service is especially popular among pensioners who are sitting at their front door waiting to strike up a conversation with Alfredo.  There have been several occasions in which he was delayed in making deliveries because he is a good listener and very patient with his customers.  His services are accepted rapidly in areas where he has not visited before.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe neighborhood of Galan is a place where the residents live peacefully.

Mr. G. is married and the father of ten children, eight of whom are now adults.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":480054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"Repair his 'sept-places' long distance taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-01-30T16:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Papa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":41135.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007525,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":41135.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036605,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":41135.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759163,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-18T08:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":41135.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790678,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":41135.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971116,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":41135.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708379,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-25T09:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":41135.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922450,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":41135.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188952,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-26T11:53:41Z","rounded_local_amount":41135.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484395,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":41135.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620640,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-30T19:19:52Z","paid_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172784,"name":"Binetou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Binetou M., aged 46, has been a commercante (vendor) since her youth, being influenced by her parents.

She says that the main challengers to her business are a lack of finances to expand the business and animal diseases, but these are mitigated by her dairy cow insurance.<P>\r\n\r\nShe successfully completed a previous loan from Juhudi Kilimo for Kes. 30,000 and then requested this loan for Kes. 30,000 to purchase a dairy cow. In the future, she would like to construct a modern dairy unity and produce over 20 litres of milk per cow each day. <P>\r\n\r\nRosemary says that the loan will help her improve her income from dairy cows so that she can educate her children who are in school. Even being a widow, she says she can manage to pay school fees and meet other necessities through the income from the dairy cow she obtained through Juhudi Kilimo.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout Juhudi Kilimo<P>\r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is an innovative, for-profit social enterprise working with smallholder farmers in Kenya.

is 42 years of age.  She is married with six children aged 5-22 years. All her children go to school. Beatrice resides in and owns a five-roomed house where she stays with six people. She takes care of additional family members.  The family eats three meals a day, and has access to electricity, but not to piped water at home.  Her greatest monthly expenses includes paying utility bills, school fees for her children and medication.  \r\n\r\nBeatrice is a poultry farmer in Makerere, where she rears both broiler and layer chickens. She picks at least 4 trays of eggs a day and sells them, retail and wholesale, to all kinds of people. She works seven days a week, serving about 10 customers a day. She has had her business for over fifteen years.  Her main challenges are transportation of chicken feed and thieves.

Beatrice and her family live around the Red Light community. She works in the Red Light market, the largest market in Liberia, which is located in Paynesville on the outskirts of the capital, Monrovia. Beatrice could not continue her education past the 7th grade due to the Liberian civil war.\r\n\r\nBeatrice's business is the sale of plantains, bananas, yams, limes, etc. She buys her goods from wholesalers and sells retail on a table at the Red Light Market. She has been running this business for 13 years and hopes to get into the general-store business in the near future.\r\n\r\nBeatrice started selling her general goods with 1,000 Liberian Dollars as working capital from her own savings. She got into it as a beginner. She talks to her customers in a good manner in order to encourage them to continue buying from her.  \r\n\r\nBeatrice needs this loan to purchase more plantains, bananas and yams for resale.

Married to BELLO Gafari, a shopkeeper, Latifath is the mother of three children, all enrolled in school. The family has been living for about three years in the Agbalilam\u00e8 neighborhood of Cotonou, economic capital of B\u00e9nin. The couple share in supporting the family. <P>\r\n\r\nLatifath did not go to school. In order to cover her various expenses, Latifath sells various products (detergent and toilet soap, sugar, eggs, tinned goods, pasta, snacks, cookies, candy, milk, manioc flour, etc.) in the MIVVO truck stop in S\u00e8m\u00e8-Podji. Latifath also sells palm oil and tea, which allows her to increase her sources of income.  <P>\r\n\r\nLatifath buys her goods from distributors in Cotonou. She has already received one loan from ALID\u00e9 and reimbursed it in a timely manner. Her clientele is ever growing, but Latifath is not able to satisfy them all since the financial means at her disposal are insufficient. Therefore, she is requesting a second loan to bolster her little business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":480162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of soap, sugar, trays of eggs, and tinned goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-01-30T18:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Latifath","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":7142.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":7142.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":7142.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":7142.86},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":7142.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":7142.86},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":7142.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.85},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.86},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.86},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.85},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.86,"local_amount":7142.86,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":8395.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123859143,"comment":null},{"amount":62.84,"local_amount":25137.14,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:24Z","rounded_local_amount":29543.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130495193,"comment":null},{"amount":28.8,"local_amount":11520,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":13539.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619284,"comment":null},{"amount":15.5,"local_amount":6200,"processed_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-28T09:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":7286.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055859,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-30T20:08:28Z","paid_date":"2010-10-28T09:51:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172835,"name":"Humberto Javier","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. L.

She recognizes that she may have a difficult road ahead of her because her suppliers were based out of Port Au Prince, which was recently struck by a major earthquake.

She said she was born the year the first road was built in her home town, Voinjama City in Lofa County, northern Liberia.\r\n\r\nVagular is divorced, with four children 17 to 47 years old with educational levels of 8th grade through high school graduate. Vagular did not have the opportunity to go to school due to poverty.\r\n\r\nVagular and her family live and work on the Rihab Road in Paynesville near Monrovia, Liberia. Her business is the sale of bags of charcoal. She buys her charcoal from rural Liberia and sells retail in the Red Light market in Paynesville.\r\n\r\nVagular started by selling plates of cooked food to residents of her community but, because the cooking made her sick -- she developed typhoid fever -- she decided to get into charcoal sales. She has been running her charcoal business for eighteen years and hopes to improve it in the near future.\r\n\r\nVagular talks to her customers with a good manner in order to encourage them to continue buying from her. She needs this loan to purchase more charcoal to improve her business.\r\n\r\nVagular dreams of educating her children and building a house for her family.

She runs her business out of this same home.  For over 10 years, she has worked selling traditional South American soups such as chainfaina and patasca.  When the earthquake hit, she had to have an operation, and was obliged to put her business aside for a moment, but today she once again maintains it.

Se\u00f1ora Franisca has always helped her children, paying for all their education, always hoping to see them achieve more every day.\r\nSe\u00f1ora Francisca and her husband are good workers.  They hope for a loan so that they will be able to invest a little more in their business, purchasing sodas to sell in the summer, since they are very popular items during that time of year.

He has been a member of U-IMCEC since September 2007 and has already received three loans. He is married and the father of two children, 4 and 6 years old. <P>\r\n\r\nIn 1985 he began to learn his trade. In 1990 he got his own tailor shop. Despite his performance in this trade, he never learned French, only the Koran. This is a choice he made freely and it is a great pleasure for him to sew beautiful boubous (traditional robes). But he is also very happy to earn a lot of money during the feast days at 'Tabaski', 'Korite' (Moslem holy days), and the New Year's holidays. <P>\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan of 200,000 frs to use to buy a sixth sewing machine so that he can improve his equipment. In future, he foresees that he will need to enlarge his workshop since his business is beginning to grow.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":480279,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"buying a 6th sewing machine for his workshop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-01-30T21:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Demba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":21155.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036613,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":21155.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759171,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":21155.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790686,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":21155.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971124,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":21155.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708386,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":21155.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922457,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":21155.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188959,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:15Z","rounded_local_amount":21155.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484402,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:19Z","rounded_local_amount":21155.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620647,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":21155.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188758242,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-31T02:08:00Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:54:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172888,"name":"Omari","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Omari S. runs a foodstuffs shop at Tabata ward in Dar es Salaam.

The members of this group of 4 women are engaged in different productive activities including: curtain and clothes sewing, catalogue sales, nail painting, hydroponic agriculture, and hot food sales. The members of this group have formed a strong bond with one another. It is apparent that these women regard community, solidarity and hard work as values central to their beliefs. Their special bond has developed because the members of the group have been neighbours all their lives, and thus know each other on a very deep and personal level. These four women were inspired to apply for a loan with Fundacion Mujer as a result of the positive experience that their colleagues in the community had had throughout the duration of their first loan.

Deilyn has a business selling hand-made clothes such as women's underwear and pyjamas. She also uses hydroponic technology to produce cabbage and lettuce for personal consumption and for sale. She started her clothes sewing and selling business with an initial investment of 10,000 colons. Deilyn will use this loan to equally develop both of her projects. Every day, she sews from 2 until 5 in the afternoon; for this she will need to purchase thread, needles, and maintain her two sewing machines.

This will help her a lot since the demand for her fruit has increased substantially and she firmly believes that she could sell twice the amount of fruit that she currently sells.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":480342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","use":"Purchase of construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yuri Anis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.4,"local_amount":788.04,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":824.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874613,"comment":null},{"amount":41.21,"local_amount":824.13,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":861.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604473,"comment":null},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":831.2,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":869.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639944,"comment":null},{"amount":39.82,"local_amount":796.32,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":832.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821729,"comment":null},{"amount":39.44,"local_amount":788.76,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":824.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561739,"comment":null},{"amount":42.38,"local_amount":847.55,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":886.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770662,"comment":null},{"amount":29.96,"local_amount":599.1,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:51Z","rounded_local_amount":626.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204552,"comment":null},{"amount":40.32,"local_amount":806.43,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":843.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330262,"comment":null},{"amount":35.91,"local_amount":718.47,"processed_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":751.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465430,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-01T18:16:20Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:41:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172903,"name":"Evelia Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Evelia Del Socorro tiene 48 a\u00f1os, este no es el primer financiamiento que solicita, por lo que est\u00e1 muy contenta por la experiencia que obtuvo con el cr\u00e9dito anterior.

The great majority of the partners own commercial businesses, in food sales, empanadas, groceries, clothing, and public transportation. For example, the president earns a living by making and distributing bread. He starts working at 3:00 in the morning, since he only has one delivery vehicle and must wake up early to make the bread and manage to distribute it to all of the stores with which he has set contracts. The best way to make your clients loyal is to make sure your products never fail. Mr. Erik Mauricio has four small children whom he must support, and he is helped by his wife, who sells pastries at the entrance of the bakery to help with the domestic expensese. In the market, there exists an ample amount of bakers, therefore the competition is high, but the president states that bread is never lacking at home if one always works hard to get ahead. The rest of the members also have a lot of competition, but they try to get ahead in life with effort, work, and appreciation for the experience that they have. This loan will be used for the purchase of supplies. For example, in the case of the president it will be used for buying flour and industrial gas cylinders, so that it is less difficult to carry and change the cylinders at any moment, since his zone does not have domestic gas through tubing. Also, this will prevent the scarcity of gas cylinders. The rest of the members desire to expand their businesses with more merchandise, supplies, and materials. Mrs. Nilda, who makes a living selling food, insists in expanding and modernizing her business so that it is more attractive for her clients that frequent it. Mrs. Walter wishes to paint her vehicle, since it is her source of income and with the age of her car, a new coat of paint is necessary. All of the expectations of these partners are for expanding their businesses and to therefore give their families a better quality of life, with effort and honest work.<br \/><p><strong>Translated

In the future, she would like to buy her own home and put up a more stable business there.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":480334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Rice sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-01-29T22:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea Fernanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":58.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":63.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":65.68},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":67.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":68.95},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.4},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.68},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.95},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.4,"local_amount":58.4,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":58.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945702,"comment":null},{"amount":63.83,"local_amount":63.83,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":63.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674064,"comment":null},{"amount":65.68,"local_amount":65.68,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":65.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708222,"comment":null},{"amount":67.12,"local_amount":67.12,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":67.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891423,"comment":null},{"amount":68.95,"local_amount":68.95,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":68.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631676,"comment":null},{"amount":76.02,"local_amount":76.02,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":76.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845564,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-29T23:42:27Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172906,"name":"Mar\u00eda Haide\u00e9","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Hayde\u00e9 B.

","en":"The communal bank \"Santa Maria\" is represented by Darwin, and is maD. up of 15 members who are working with our foundation in their 2nd loan cycle, demonstrating, as always, responsibility and compliance in their payments.  A great majority of the members sell products, such as groceries, fruit, electric appliances, snacks, and some have businesses, such as a bakery.  For example, Darwin works in public passenger transportation from 6 in the morning until 11 at night so that he can make a daily income and support his 3 children and his wife.  His wife weaves blankets and sells them on order so that she can help her husband a little, who works very hard every day to improve the quality of life for his family.  As far as the competitive environment, one might say that it is very strong, since many of the members find it necessary to take their sales to outlying areas due to the strong competition in the market.  Those who sell from their homes must wait for their customers to come to get their businesses moving.  In the case of Maria Luisa, who sells food, she has her boarders and does not have much trouble making her daily income.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy supplies, merchandise, tools and materials.  For example, Darwin will buy spare parts for his vehicle, since his springs are failing and he needs money to change them.  Maria Luisa wants to make some changes to the furniture in her boarding-house, to proviD. better comfort for her customers, who are the ones that generate the income necessary to support her family.  The main expectation of the members is to make their businesses grow so that their families do not lack for anything and so that they can give their families greater comfort in their homes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":480355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"working capital to buy supplies, merchandise, tools and materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Darwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Editta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Editha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeslee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Solange","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":3600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4048.4},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4094.98},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4142.1},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4189.77},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":4237.98},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4286.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":582.97},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":589.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":596.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":603.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":610.27},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":617.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1172.65,"local_amount":8143.38,"processed_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:26Z","rounded_local_amount":8173.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909433,"comment":null},{"amount":596.46,"local_amount":4142.1,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4157.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909434,"comment":null},{"amount":603.33,"local_amount":4189.77,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4205.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945008,"comment":null},{"amount":610.27,"local_amount":4237.98,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4253.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945009,"comment":null},{"amount":617.29,"local_amount":4286.77,"processed_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4302.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945010,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-01T23:03:12Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172908,"name":"Aminata","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Aminata SADIO est une femme de 44 ans, elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 2 enfant.

Such shows responsibility and industriousness, and the group is very grateful for the economic support and trust provided by the parties involved.  Most of the members sell products such as food, clothes, domestic appliances, cosmetics, and alcoholic beverages.  Some members proviD. domestic services.  The group's President sells typical fare such as majaditos (a regional rice dish), patasca D. trigo pelado (wheat with jerked beef) and soup in the market from very early till late.  Therefore, she has very little time to spend with her children.  She hopes to spend more time with them, by focusing on lunch sales only, thereby increasing her earning potential.  However, at present, providing her children with an education and a roof over their heads takes priority.  As is the case with Sarah, many of the group's members also have to leave home to work.  However, such is the price they pay for household upkeep and to improve the lives of their children.  The purpose of the loan is to buy consumables, utensils and other necessary products in order to generate a higher income for the members' households.  The members' greatest wish is to be able to proviD. a stable home for their children as most of the members rent accommodation or live in 'anticr\u00edticos' (a particular type of renting) and are constantly having to relocate in search of a new place in which to rent.  Therefore, members have to work to be able to purchase a property or build on plots of land, which some have already managed to buy and which will proviD. a better life for their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Justine Raymond, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":480362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To generate business income ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-02T10:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Orlando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22500,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2135.94},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2160.51},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.37},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2210.52},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2235.96},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2261.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2287.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.04},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2340.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2367.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.08},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":319.3},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.97},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":326.69},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.09},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":936.26,"local_amount":6481.82,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6525.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909437,"comment":null},{"amount":319.3,"local_amount":2210.52,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2225.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909438,"comment":null},{"amount":322.97,"local_amount":2235.96,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2251.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945013,"comment":null},{"amount":326.69,"local_amount":2261.69,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2277.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945014,"comment":null},{"amount":1002.49,"local_amount":6940.32,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6987.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673346,"comment":null},{"amount":0.3,"local_amount":2.09,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707368,"comment":null},{"amount":341.99,"local_amount":2367.6,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707369,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-05T22:47:57Z","paid_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":172911,"name":"Gustavo Adolfo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gustavo es un hombre muy trabajador, que disfruta de su trabajo.

The group's 14 members are working with Fundaci\u00f3n AgroCapital for the second time; they have proven to be co-operative and punctual. Each member of La Costanera has his\/her own business. They sell food, baked goods, snacks, alcoholic drinks, fish, groceries and gasoline. Maria, the group leader, sells snacks and has a job making sandwiches and hamburgers. Maria is a single mother; she lives with her young daughter, her mother and her little sisters. She doesn't have to pay rent, but she works to get ahead because she wants to help her sisters get an education, and she wants to help her mother with household responsibilities. There's a lot of competition in the local labour market these days, but the members of La Costanera have experience and problem-solving skills working in their favour. They'll be using this loan to purchase the supplies, materials and tools they need for their businesses. For example, Maria wants a push-cart that she can use when selling burgers. She'd be able to move to new locations when sales in one spot taper off. The group hopes that more and better supplies and equipment will help their sales, their families and their overall quality of life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy,

They demonstrate punctuality with their payments and they have a lot of desire to work, as they demonstrate in their sales businesses of selling raw and cooked fish, clothes, empanadas, food, and cosmetics.  Some of the members have other businesses such as motorcycle taxi drivers and domestic services.

She has a modest but cosy small house, which is where they have their meetings with the members.  Like all businesses, they have competition, the majority of the members of this group have their sales stand in the fish market, located in the 13 of April region, so therefore there are always sales of cooked plates or fresh fish.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe use of the loan is for the growth of their businesses, and in the future they hope to have sales stands in other city markets.  They will invest in the purchase of supplies and raw materials for storage.

She wants her mother to be in a good environment.  For over two years they have lived in a tent and pre-fabricated housing.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys good references from her neighbors.  They say that she is a very good daughter, and that she is responsible.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

The couple has an only child, Ronald M., who is a 22-year-old factory worker. She and her husband work hard but they had a very small income and they didn't even have capital to start up a business. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Carolina heard about ASHI, a Kiva partner. She dreamed of having a stable life with a stable house and of starting a business. When she received her first and succeeding loans from ASHI, she started her own business of buying and selling small retail goods. It has been many years that she has had this kind of business. Retailing of small goods has been a great help to her family. \r\n\r\nHowever, the demands of her family grow as years goes by, so she aspires to have more business that can add to her present income so she will have bigger profits and savings. Then she came up with the idea of operating computer rentals. It has been great! She earns a good income and she wants to have more investment in it. On her 11th loan, she is proposing to borrow 40,000.00 Philippine pesos to expand her growing business.\r\n\r\nWith this kind of business, she can still manage her previous business of retailing small goods, because either her child or husband can operate their computer rental at home when she's away selling goods. Someday, as her income increases, she wants the computer shop separate from their house because the computers are placed in part of their home. Her greatest dreams are to get out from the spiral of poverty and to have a happy life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":480534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"For

A. is a 42-year-old married mother of three. Her youngest is a 5-year-old and her oldest is a high school student. She and her husband work together buying and selling cell phones in their village and at the market. This couple has been in this business for more than three years now. Her husband also works as a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) driver for extra income to support and sustain the family. Emma also runs a variety store for supplementary profits, and she is a housing loan agent from time to time, because her husband's income is not enough to provide for all the needs of her three children. \r\n\r\nEmma joined ASHI in 2006, aiming to get out of the spiral of poverty and consistently acquire working capital for her business. She will use this loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos to buy a supply of cell phones for resale. She says ASHI-Kiva partners have good hearts for the poor, like her family, and really help them reach their dreams. That is why this couple has grown to love this institution very much.\r\n\r\nEmma hopes that one day she will be able to have her own produce stall at the marketplace, instead of selling cell phone products from her house. She wants to be able to make enough money to pay for her children's education. She dreams of the best life for her family, who live together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":480538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile

He is separated but he has 5 grown children who, like him, work in construction. When he was very young he learned the trade of bricklayer.  At first he only watched, but when he was sure nothing stopped him from this work.  He is currently a construction foreman, that is to say one who hires for a construction project and brings his team of bricklayers, which he leads with his experience until the work is finished.  He is passionate about his work, since he has a lot of work and has good earnings.  In addition, it is a trade that he passed on to his children, who have already formed their own families and are supporting themselves with their work in construction, like their father did.  \r\n\r\nIn spite of his age, Abraham is a man who has a strong desire to get ahead and who has many plans for the future, such as building a construction company with his own vehicle and cement mixer.  In this way he would be able to hire for large projects and would earn much more money.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP, and he assures us that he will be very punctual with each of his payments, so that he can continue to advance.  With the money that he requests he will buy a drill and other tools that he needs that will help him to do his job better.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

He lives in his own home with his wife, Delza, who is 25, and their young daughter, Diana, who is 8 years old, in a tourist location outside of Lima.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen he was very young he learned the art of jewelry making.

He produces and gives shape to the pieces of crisocola (and blue-green mineral) that are set in the gold and silver jewelry.  Cirilo is very satisfied with his work because he likes it, as it is an art that has provided for him economically throughout most of his life.  On the other hand, there are few people who know everything about this trade, and as he himself says: \"in this art one must be very cautious,\" and for this reason he only works with his family.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the first loan he has had with MFP and he is certain he will punctually complete each of the loan payments, as he hopes to obtain a larger quantity of money in the future to keep progressing.  With the money he asks for he will buy material (crisocola) to finish a large order he currently has and he hopes to increase his earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily

She is married and has two married children. Her husband works as a vet in a rural district, her son is a taxi driver, and her daughter is a housewife. \r\n<br>Habibahon is a farm worker who also owns some livestock. She has been in this business since the early 1990s. She started it after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when most government agricultural land was privatized. At the present time, her seasonal income from farming exceeds $1500 USD. Habibahon usually spends all her income in covering family expenses. Her business earnings have meant that her family could marry both children, build a house for her son, and increase the number of livestock. In the near future, Habibahon is planning to open a food market near her house. This is her first loan from Kiva partner, Mol Bulak Finance, and it will be used to buy potato seeds and 300 kilos of mineral fertilizers.\r\n<br>Hojiumar, 49, is a father of two married children. He is a farmer, and will use his loan to buy potato seeds and fertilizers. Hojiumar has a dream of building a pharmacy and barber shop in the village center because the local population has to go to the district center to buy drugs.  \r\n<br>Adinahon, 41, is also a farmer. Her family has a total of 0.47 hectare of land. She cultivates potatoes and wheat there. She is requesting a loan to prepare for the spring sowing by plowing and buying potato seeds. Adinahon is married with two children. Her husband works in a cotton plant, and all her family members take an active role in the family business. \r\n<br>Gaznahan is 47 years old. She is a widow with four children, the eldest two of whom are married. The other two children are students. Gaznahan will use her loan to buy 500 kilos of potato seeds and 100 kilos of fertilizer. In the future, Gaznahan hopes that she will be able to build a house for her second son.
