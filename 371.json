He is 41 years old and married. He is the father of a 17-year-old, two 14-year-olds, and a 10-year-old, all of whom attend school. He only went to school through the 10th grade, and wasn't able to continue because of his family's difficult financial circumstances. He lives in his own house with his family, and also supports a nephew who lives with them.\r\nHe and his family left Manhi\u00e7a for Boane, also in Maputo Province, fleeing the war that devastated the country during the '80s. He's had his own business for more than four years. He doesn't have any employees, and sells blankets, microwaves, air conditioners, refrigerators, etc. He earns about 20,000 meticals a month, which is enough to cover household expenses with a little left over to keep in his savings account.\r\nHe's never received loans from other banks. He learned about Hvuluku through friends who are also Hvuluku clients. This is his second loan, in the amount of 25,000 meticals, which he will use to buy products (bathtubs, refrigerators, microwaves, etc.) to increase the amount of merchandise he carries.\r\nHe's committed to paying this loan off on time so that in the future he'll be eligible for others. He'd like to request additional loans to expand his business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva

Married to Gustave Loko, an agent in the Ministry of Finance, she is the mother of six children, all having attended school, and only one still living under her care. Symphorienne lives with her husband and her remaining child, and shares with her husband responsibility for family expenses.\r\n\r\nTo assist her husband, Symphorienne retails a range of products (soap, plastic cups and basins, sugar, batteries, etc.). She gets her supplies from Dantokpa, Benin\u2019s international marketplace, and sells her products in her shop in Fidjross\u00e9. She attended school at primary level, but very soon began commercial activities.\r\n\r\nSymphorienne is a regular client of ALID\u00e9, and reimburses well her loans. She wants to extend the range of products she sells but lacks the financial means to do so. That is why she is now requesting another loan from ALID\u00e9, which will help her respond to an ever-increasing number of customers. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":491011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy soap, plastic cups and basins, sugar, batteries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-03-19T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Symphorienne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":180000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":15932.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653269,"comment":null},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:32:07Z","rounded_local_amount":15932.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835476,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":15932.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575873,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":15932.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954387,"comment":null},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:06Z","rounded_local_amount":15932.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056045,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":45000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-28T09:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":47798.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347579,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":15932.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482654,"comment":null},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":15932.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617490,"comment":null},{"amount":38.87,"local_amount":17492,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":18579.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191360909,"comment":null},{"amount":27.8,"local_amount":12508,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":13285.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401506,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-20T05:17:18Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":186071,"name":"Ma.

She is 50 years old, married and childless though she has 4 nephews and nieces 15,13, 9 and 7 years old. They are all in school. She never studied, since her parents didn't allow her or her sisters to go to school saying she would learn prostitution. She lives in her own house with her husband, nephews and nieces. Apart from these, she has no other dependents. \r\n\r\nShe left Matola for the district of Boane when she was still very young. She continued to live there after she was married. She has had her own shop for more than 6 years, and has an employee to help her with the business. She earns around 6500 MZN a month, and uses it to cover her household expenses while saving some at home, since she's unfamiliar with the banking system. \r\n\r\nIn the past she took out loans through the TCHUMA credit union but didn't continue for various reasons. She learned about Hluvuku through business partners who are already clients. This is her fifth loan with Hluvuku, for 22,000 MZN. She plans to buy products (beer, wine, soft drinks, potatoes and others) to increase her stock. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of one day owning a suitable home, and in the future would like to take out additional loans for her business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by David Kaisel, Kiva

However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. \r\n\r\nCarolyne is using her loan of 50,000 Kenyan shillings to buy more hair weaves and chemicals to expand her business.

Komil is a successful father and dedicated husband. He has three children.\r\n<p>\r\nKomil began a small grocery store five years ago with a small capital of savings. He was assisted by his wife who helps him with serving his clients. Today his clientele has grown greater and his grocery become more popular.\r\n<p>\r\nHe is asking for a loan of 3000 USD so that he may expand the variety of goods that are sold in his store. Komil is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve successes in his business with this loan. \r\n<em>\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low- income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Ugul is 45 years old, married, and the mother of two children. Ugul's lack of a stable job and the slow productivity of her husband's business as an ecologist left insufficient money to pay for the family's expenses. This was the reason that Ugul decided to start her own business nine years ago selling fabric for national dresses. \r\nLittle by little, she has grown her business. By offering her customers the opportunity to pay in installments, her orders are growing. Now her business is running normally, but she would like to continue bettering herself and her business so that her situation will be stable in the future. She is asking for a loan of $2,500 USD to buy seasonal fabrics for national dresses. The power to help her business grow is in your hands. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sohibjon is 41 years old, married, and has two children.

He gets up early every morning in order to feed the animals and look after them. His knowledge and skills allow him to make his business successful and generate a stable and considerable income for his large family. Sohibjon has a large and friendly family who are always trying to help each other.\r\n<br>Today, knowing that prices for animals are not so high now, but will increase for sure, Sohibjon is planning to enlarge his stock and purchase cattle.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The business has, however, had its own setbacks like the lack of steady inflowing capital to enable it to expand.\r\n\r\nAllen hopes to open new horizons for her business and once she can obtain this loan, she plans to buy more beers, sodas, wines and other drinks for her stock.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":509237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","use":"To buy more beers, sodas, wines and other drinks for her bar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ntungamo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.916667 30.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-03-21T17:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Allen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3900000,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":975000},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":975000},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":975000},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":975000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":975000,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:45:26Z","rounded_local_amount":976568.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129009522,"comment":null},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":975000,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:53:40Z","rounded_local_amount":976568.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136733808,"comment":null},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":975000,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":976568.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144767098,"comment":null},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":975000,"processed_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":976568.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662132,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-24T19:41:39Z","paid_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":186175,"name":"Mussarat's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mussarat is 31-year old lady.

Their customer base is both male and female.\r\nThey aim to generate an average monthly profit of 36,000 FCFA which will be used to buy food and to pay for their children's healthcare.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":509293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchasing various products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-20T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami                             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":83647.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746556,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:19Z","rounded_local_amount":83647.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779104,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":83647.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961304,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":83647.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699429,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:16Z","rounded_local_amount":83647.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913349,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":83647.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180523,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-21T12:28:10Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":186205,"name":"Rashida's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rashida belongs to a city named Lahore, in Pakistan.

Presently, she is making profits of 140,000 shillings a month and hopes her financial prospects will improve once she can access a loan.\r\n\r\nWith using loans, Alice carries a strong belief that she will be able to open her own tailoring school, but this time around she needs to stock more clothing materials in bulk for business improvement.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":509414,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To buy more cloth in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mukono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.25 32.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Novah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Damalie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramulah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yoweri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hanifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4500000,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":281250},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":281250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":186282,"name":"Blenda Johana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Blenda C. de 27 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona periurbana en el Fort\u00edn de Guayaquil, su casa es de cemento y solo cuenta con luz, esta casada y tiene 1 hijo de 4 a\u00f1os. \n\nElla era empleada en una f\u00e1brica de muebles pero como no pod\u00eda darle una buena vida a su familia decidi\u00f3 invertir sus pocos ahorros en esponjas, pinturas, telas  y empezar en conjunto con su esposo la actividad de ebanista. \n\nYa tiene 2 a\u00f1os siendo ebanista con su esposo, trabajan hasta las 17h00 todos los d\u00edas.

is a 39-year-old single mother of two from Para\u00edso de Cartago located in the central valley of Costa Rica. She has had to fight hard in order to improve living conditions for herself and her two children.\r\n\r\nPatricia has worked over the past ten years selling podiatrist (foot treatment) services. She learned how to work in podiatry as an employee in a clinic many years ago. She opened her business with an initial investment of 20,000 colones. She specializes in providing podiatry services to clients living with diabetes as well as to seniors.\r\n\r\nThis will be Patricia\u2019s second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer; her first loan was paid back on time and in full. Her goal is to increase her client base in order to earn more revenues and continue to provide a quality standard of living for her children.\r\n\r\nIn a good month Patricia might earn 600,000 colones and in a bad month, only 200,000. She dedicates eight hours a day to her business, while her children are at school. Patricia hopes to use the revenues from her business to finance housing costs, invest in home improvements, re-invest in her business, make contributions to her savings, and to repay her loan.\r\n\r\nThe income generated from Patricia\u2019s business represents 90% of family income and is used to finance the living expenses of Patricia and her two children. Her long term goals are to open her own clinic and to invest in higher quality education for her children. \r\n\r\nRecently, Patricia had a car accident. The use of her vehicle is central to the operation of her business as she uses it to visit clients and carry out her daily routine. She will use this loan to finance repairs to her car so that she can continue to work towards the expansion of her business. At the moment, she is using a car borrowed from a friend to conduct her business.\r\n\r\nPatricia says her only obstacle is time. If she had somebody to help her perform some of her domestic tasks, she would be able to dedicate more time to her

From the age of 18, she has worked at a beauty salon and aesthetics practice where she learned how to administer body massages.  Since then, she has never abandoned this activity.  Danilse also sells cosmetics through a catalog and is able to combine both of these activities perfectly.  She offers her cosmetics to the same customers who receive massage services.  \r\n<p>\r\nDanilse has three children (ages 9, 11, and 18).  She is very happy because two years ago she bought a lot in the Macro-project Housing Village in San Pablo with the help of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She also obtained a state subsidy from the Colombian government, so she and her three children will be able to have their own home.  As a result, Danilse will have another location for serving potential customers to her business because she plans to provide massage services and sell cosmetics from her new home.  She knows it is very important to be at the forefront of information technology and allow her children to also progress with these new breakthroughs.  Therefore, she is requesting a loan in the amount of 1,500,000 COP to purchase a computer that she will use to manage and operate her business.  She will learn with her children how to operate it because they love working with computers.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she started with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo three years ago, she came with a friend and from that moment has taken out four loans that have helped to improve her business.  She now offers better service by utilizing cr\u00e8mes, ointments, and relaxing cosmetics that her customers also buy.  Danilse still dreams for the moment when she can spend time at her home at Villas de San Pablo.  She also wants to see her children become educated and develop into good people.

Kely is 27-years old and makes a living selling costume jewelry.  She has been an entrepreneur since she was a girl, selling first to her school friends when she was a teenager.  At times, the family lived on her sales but she was ultimately able to buy the small lot where they now live and they have gradually developed it.  She has a glass case for the business where she can display her products but her best customers are her husband's co-workers and the nurses and aides at a rehabilitation center where she takes her daughter for treatment.  This is the first time that Kely has applied to the Fundacion for a loan.  Her brother, who has links with the bank, recommended that she apply.

She works independently selling through specialized guides that offer products such as clothing and cosmetics, but she also drives to the shoe store to take advantage of bargains, discounts, or discontinued models.  Omaira is well-connected since her daughter works at a shoe warehouse and lets her know when such opportunities exist.  However, she needs the capital to be able to buy these items, so she decided to join Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo based on a friend\u2019s recommendation.  She is now requesting a loan in the amount of 2,000,000 COP so that she can purchase merchandise from a brother-in-law who has a shoe business in Cartegena and sells at wholesale prices, so she will be able to increase her profit margin.\r\n<p>\r\nOmaira began her business when her husband was transferred to La Guajira, another Colombian department in the eastern part of the country along the Caribbean coast.  At that time, she sold her products because she was familiar with the large warehouses in Barraquilla.  She had worked with them previously, and they still continue to offer excellent prices.  Her customers are also requesting jeans, so she is finding that such purchases are very profitable.  Omaira has a friend who also sells through a catalog and gives her a 25% cut of the profit.  Their goal is to find a location where they both can sell their products.  Omaira hopes to find a space on a street corner where they can increase their income because they both want to settle in a place that is more commercially visible.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Maize grows really well there, and the local adults work in farming. The younger people have moved to the big cities or overseas.\r\n\r\n42-year old Sra. Martha is married and has four children aged 20, 17, 11, and 8. Her eldest daughter helps her with the sales of the produce in the market. Her 17-year old son works as a bricklayer, and the younger two are students at the local school called Agust\u00edn C. Vintimilla. Her husband is a bricklayer, and they are in the process of building their own home.\r\n\r\nMartha has a stall in the market where she sells different sorts of fresh grains and vegetables. She\u2019s been doing this job since she was seven years old helping her mother. At the age of twenty one, she started her own stall where she works from 4 am buying produce and stays until 6pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. On Thursday and Fridays she works in a cafe--she\u2019s been doing this for four years--from 8am to 6pm. She also raises chickens to sell in Cuenca market.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with the foundation. She was encouraged to join the community bank by one of her friends in the market. With the money she is going to buy carrots, tomatoes, onions, chard, cabbage, lettuce, and baby chicks. She will also buy vitamins and food for the chicks. In addition, Martha will buy Ardex roofing for her house. Her goal is to complete the construction of the house.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Cruz Q. lives in the big city of Cuenca with three of her five children. The oldest two are married and live independently. Her 23-year old son is a bricklayer and gives her some money towards the household expenses.  Her daughter helps her with the market stall, and her youngest son is a student at the Turi technical college. \r\n\r\nThe house she lives in is her own, and she put in a lot of effort to build it. Her husband travelled overseas twelve years ago in search of the American dream and economic stability for the whole family, but when he got there he forgot about his family. Mar\u00eda says she has a new partner with whom she is rebuilding her life.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda sells quesillo (soft cheese), cheese, and all kinds of grains in the market. She\u2019s been doing this job for 35 years. She began in the 12 de Abril market and now works in the Feria Libre market where she\u2019s been for 21 years. She works there every day without a day off from 6am to 6pm. She doesn\u2019t have her own market stall but walks around the market.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with the foundation, and with the money she plans to buy cheese, tomatoes, onions, carrots, chard, cabbage and other vegetables to increase her stock. She spends a lot of money buying the produce each week. Mar\u00eda\u2019s dream is for her son to study hard, become a professional, and get a good job.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":508752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy vegetables, chicks, and roofing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-03-19T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Zhina Lorenza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"  Mar\u00eda Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"  Laura Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Martha Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Diana Magaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mar\u00eda Cruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mar\u00eda Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2640,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":220}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":220.83,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":220.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946578,"comment":null},{"amount":662.5,"local_amount":660,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674790,"comment":null},{"amount":220.84,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":220.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708963,"comment":null},{"amount":220.83,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":220.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708964,"comment":null},{"amount":220.83,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":220.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892259,"comment":null},{"amount":220.84,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":220.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892260,"comment":null},{"amount":441.66,"local_amount":440,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":441.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632647,"comment":null},{"amount":441.67,"local_amount":440,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":441.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846717,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-28T10:21:43Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":186302,"name":"Cesar Gustavo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Cesar es Carpintero  hace varios a\u00f1os, es casado con la Sra.

He works in agriculture, growing crops such as beans, corn and potatoes. He also keeps livestock, taking care of his herd and buying and selling animals. He will use the loan to buy 4 steers to raise and sell. He will then put the income from these 4 animals to further use. Fidel Salvador began selling livestock after the harvest season for his crops ended, in order to have an additional type of work. At first, he sold calves that were born to his cows, keeping only one female. When he saw that this was going well and producing profits, he began to work with financial support from us to buy more animals and increase his income. \r\n\r\nFidel Salvador dedicates himself full-time to agriculture. After the winter harvest, he plants staple crops such as beans and corn to sell. He also raises vegetables such as potatoes, using an irrigation system. He does this work in summer, and he also works buying and selling livestock. \r\n\r\nBefore he started raising livestock, he worked exclusively raising staple crops in the winter season. He has done this work since his childhood, since he grew up in the countryside and was accustomed to this work. Now, with this additional livestock business, he hopes to continue improving the effectiveness of his work, increasing the number of cattle he sells and thus obtaining more income and having work throughout the year. Fidel has a wife who helps him in his work as well as with the household chores, such as preparing food and taking care of their children. He has 4 children who are in school and who also help him on the farm.\r\n\r\nFidel has been a client of Ceprodel for 9 years and has received 12 loans to support his agricultural work.

D\u00e1vila is a farmer who lives in the community of San Jer\u00f3nimo located about 30km from Condega. He owns a small farm there and grows crops such as beans, maize and coffee which he then sells. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking for will be used to buy agricultural supplies such as 6 quintales (unit equal to 100lb) of fertilizer and 6 quintales of urea. Reynaldo will use these products on his coffee crops to ensure a good harvest. He began farming when, in the 1980s, the state gave him two manzanas (about 3.5 acres) of land on which to grow coffee as part of the agrarian reform program. Nowadays he raises animals as well as growing crops. He sows beans on 4 manzanas and maize on 2 manzanas in the winter. He also sows coffee beans once a year as his farm is located in a high mountainous area with appropriate conditions for growing coffee.\r\n\r\nReynaldo has done this kind of work since he was small, starting out by helping his parents on their small farm. With the loan he hopes to use the products on his crops so he can get a bigger and better-quality harvest. Then he will get the chance to sell the products for a better price, especially the coffee which is very important since it is an export crop.\r\n\r\nDon Reynaldo is married and has three children, two of whom attend primary school. He has had six loans since 2005 and used the money for his farm. The impact and benefits have been important as they have allowed Reynaldo to expand his farm, increase the harvests, and improve his quality of life. During this period he has built a small house, bought four cows that had recently given birth, two bullocks, and also more land. He currently has 4 manzanas growing coffee, 6 manzanas growing other crops, and 4 manzanas of trees. It is very clear that this client has benefited greatly from the loans.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":509505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy agricultural supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reynaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":186327,"name":"Sixta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Sixta D., tiene 51 a\u00f1os de edad es casada y con su familia, vive en el barrio Laureles Sur, ellos tiene 4 hijos de  los cuales el mayor vive independiente y los otros, tres trabajan en un mercado muy conocido de Managua vendiendo gallinas, de esta forma es que sobreviven d\u00eda a d\u00eda.\n\nElla tiene un peque\u00f1o puesto de venta de tortillas el cual se ha vuelto muy popular en el barrio, es por esta raz\u00f3n que ellos solicitan de un pr\u00e9stamo para agrandar el local de la venta, comprar materia prima  e instalar unas ventanas, que les  traer\u00e1 mejor ventilaci\u00f3n y le embellecer\u00e1n su hogar, puesto que la venta la tiene en su casa, estas condiciones mejoraran su estilo de vida y el de su familia.\n","en":"Sra.

Ella se dedica a la crianza de vacas, vende leche y hace queso, inici\u00f3 su negocio hace 4 a\u00f1os. Solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para la  compra de alimento y forrajes para sus vacas y tambi\u00e9n quiere comprar unos pollos para engordarlos y despu\u00e9s venderlos, ya que suele dedicarse a la crianza de animales en general, pues comenta, todo es negocio y hay que aprovechar. Sus clientes y vecinos la consideran una mujer muy activa y trabajadora pues a pesar de no tener una preparaci\u00f3n acad\u00e9mica es una excelente administrador, quien adem\u00e1s de atender su negocio y su hogar tiene bajo su cuidado a dos de sus nietecitos, a quienes desde ahora les inculca el amor al trabajo. \nAl momento de solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo se siente motivada  a seguir adelante y agradecida por la oportunidad que se le brinda de obtener un cr\u00e9dito sin tanto requisito.

Solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para iniciar su negocio de bisuter\u00eda en el cual ya tiene experiencia,  y en su momento le fue muy bien, por lo que considera que es una muy buena opci\u00f3n para obtener mas ingresos para su hogar y poder brindar a sus hijos una  calidad de vida. Adem\u00e1s tiene la ventaja de que podr\u00e1 atender sus dos negocios a la vez pues mientras sus clientas compran tortillas, podr\u00e1n ver su joyer\u00eda y as\u00ed poco a poco se ir\u00e1n animando a comprar alguna novedad. De esta manera con las ganancias que ambos le generen tendr\u00e1 la oportunidad de establecer bien su negocio de tortillas ya que actualmente lo trabaja en un peque\u00f1o espacio de un local que le prestaron y para ella su sue\u00f1o es tener su propio localito bien equipado y acondicionado para brindar mejor calidad y servicio a sus clientes. \nAl momento de solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo se muestra muy optimista porque para ella es muy importante que su negocio crezca y comenta \u00e9sta es una buena oportunidad con la que espera sacar adelante a su familia.  \n\nLas dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son:\n-\tGabriela M.

There are ten members in the group.\r\n<p>\r\nEleuteria Mart\u00ednez L. is one of the group members.  She is 61 years old and has no education.  Eleuteria works as a homemaker and farmer.  She has seven children, three daughters and four sons, who are all grown and care for her two grandchildren (ages 10 and 6).  Eleuteria raises dairy cows, sells the milk, and produces cheese.  She started this business four years ago.  The loan she is requesting will be used to buy feed and fodder for her cows.  She will also buy a few chickens to fatten for subsequent resale since she already raises animals.  Eleuteria says her business is everything, so she has to make the most of it.  Her customers and neighbors consider her to be an active and hardworking woman who is an excellent manager despite not having any academic training.  In addition to tending to her business and household, she also looks after her two young grandchildren in whom she tries to instill a love of work.  At the time of this loan request, Eleuteria felt motivated to press forward and was appreciative of this opportunity to obtain a loan with few requirements.  She hopes to secure this loan so that she can maintain her business with which she will be able to leave an inheritance for her grandchildren.\r\n<p>\r\nIrma O. V. is the group president.  She is 42 years old, married, and has a sixth grade education.  Irma has three children, a daughter (age 2) and two sons (ages 4 and 5).  A year ago, she started her business selling handmade tortillas.  She is requesting a loan so that she can start a costume jewelry business since she already has experience.  At the moment, Irma is doing very well but she believes this will be a better option to earn more household income to provide her children a higher quality of life.  She will also have the advantage of running two businesses at the same time because customers who buy tortillas will be able to see her jewelry.  Gradually they will be convinced to buy some of her novelties.  With the earnings from both ventures, she will have the opportunity to improve her tortilla business since the location where she currently works is a small space.  Her dream is to have a better location that is well-equipped and suited for providing a better quality of service to her customers.  At the time of her loan request, Irma was very optimistic because she says growing her business is a good opportunity for her family to get ahead.\r\n<p>\r\n The other group members are as follows:\r\n- Gabriela M.

She is requesting the loan to invest in the store and buy groceries, spices, condiments, etc. Her customers are people from the same community; there are not many stores in the area, and her customers seek her and prefer her because they can find everything they need such as spices, condiments, dry chiles, groceries, and other products. She is very happy requesting this loan because her store will have more merchandise. She wants this loan to invest even more. With time, she also hopes to buy a car so she can transport the products herself from her providers.

L. is 26 and married with 1 child (2 years-old).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Piniki has 3 years of experience in this business.  Piniki needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Piniki joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Piniki's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Piniki L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

M. is 45 and married with 4 children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Ailima has many years of experience in this business.  Ailima needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  Ailima wishes to extend her business as she applies for another fund to assist her development.\n\nAilima joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ailima's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

G. is 50 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Kaiva has 3 years of experience in this business.  Kaiva needs a loan of WST $1700 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nKaiva joined SPBD.This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Kaiva's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Kaiva G. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 55 and married with 6 children (ages 9 - 18).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Veronika has many years of experience in this business.  Veronika needs a loan of WST $3000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Veronika joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Veronika's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Veronika L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

E. joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap Inc.), a Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 2005. Since then, she has grown to love the organization. ASHI helped her in the start-up of a business, supporting her husband with their daily expenditures. She and her husband have been direct selling Avon products for more than five years and also embarked in buying and selling dried fish in the local community. \r\n\r\nShe now proposes that her eighth loan, amounting to 45,000.00 Philippine pesos, be used to continue her businesses with the support of her husband. She will purchase inventory of supplies like cologne, body lotion, lipstick, sandals, shoes, perfumes, jackets and other stock. The remaining loan funds will be used for her dried-fish business for additional income.\r\n\r\nExpanding Perpetua\u2019s business will be the source of income to finance the needs of her family and to have a comfortable house to live in. She also hopes to expand her business and if possible, have a branch in other provinces, particularly in her hometown in order to provide employment to her relatives.\r\n\r\nShe is very thankful to all members of ASHI for educating her, especially in dealing with other people and the ability to accept new challenges in her life and in achieving her dreams to improve their way of life. Perpetua is also grateful to the ASHI-Kiva partnership for supporting people like her who want to move away from poverty and get ahead. She hopes that they continue this way for a long time and help many poor families.\r\n\r\nThe couple has a strong belief not to be affected by poverty; instead they are inspired to work hard for their five children.\r\n\r\n<b>About ASHI<\/b>\r\n \r\nAs a micro-finance institution that uses the Grameen methodology, Ahon sa Hirap (ASHI), being the first practitioner in the field, saw how poor women and mothers work hard to earn money for the cash flow of their families and to provide their children with a better life.\r\n\r\nThe micro-credit ASHI is extending to these women is delivered directly to their villages and on the doorstep of their houses. When the loan is handed over to them, it is giving them hope that someday they will rise above poverty.

65 years old, Joram has six grown children and now a four-year-old grandchild.

He sells the bananas, milk, and maize from his farm in the local market. He also earns income from his posho mill (pictured with Joram above) by charging other farmers a fee to grind cereals, mostly maize, into flour. The main challenge to his business is a lack of funding for farming inputs such as seeds and manure.

He has been farming for 20 years but also earns some extra income as a carpenter. The challenge to his business is managing fluctuations in price and demand in the milk market.\r\n<br>Arthur successfully repaid a previous loan from Kiva partner, Juhudi Kilimo, for 25,000 KES. He has requested a new loan of 31,800 KES to buy and insure a dairy cow. He says that Juhudi Kilimo is doing an incredible job of helping low-income farmers to acquire assets.

Lorita is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her sixth from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About PMPC<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":509013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The shelling used to be performed using two stones to crack each nut, separating the kernel and shell simultaneously. This manual operation has been largely superseded by the use of nut-cracking machines.\r\n\r\nThe traditional oil extraction method is to simply heat the dried nuts to release the palm kernel oil. The released oil is periodically skimmed from the top as heat is applied.

is 38 years old and has been a member of Kiva partner, ASHI, since 2007. She actively participates in all ASHI activities, despite her busy schedule attending to the needs of her fruit and vegetable business and those of her family. For Jofely, a rest day or a day off is the time she spends with her ASHI co-members. Every second, minute and hour of it is her most treasured time because she can learn many things about different aspects of life from the sharing time they have together. For her, knowing and learning to communicate and connect to other people are the best ingredients in making a business, aside from having business capital and other financial services from ASHI. \r\nJofely's husband\u2019s support is also very important in making her fruit and vegetable farming and selling business grow. Without that, she would not have the courage to request a loan to expand the business. Her aspiration of supporting the education of her three children until college graduation has always been her top priority. Therefore, she really has to work hard at enhancing her

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They are counting on an increase in their working capital to better satisfy customer demand and to set up a stall for their sales activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":509829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Buy various products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kadiolo Sikasso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-20T22:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":20065.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746557,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":20065.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779105,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:04Z","rounded_local_amount":20065.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961305,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":20065.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699430,"comment":null},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:21Z","rounded_local_amount":20065.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913350,"comment":null},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":20065.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180524,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-21T02:41:34Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":186500,"name":"Sonia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sonia S. is happy for having five children whose age range is from 4 to 17 years. However, because of her small income from selling fruits and vegetables raised by her husband, who is a farmer, she feels guilty sometimes because she can\u2019t give her children things they need. But despite that, she still feels privileged because her husband and children are all loving and understanding.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sonia joined ASHI in order to have the opportunity of obtaining a loan to finance her business growth. Since then she has also been able to receive loans which support her husband\u2019s business. With that, the volume of fruits and vegetables she sells has increased a bit as well as her profit.\r\n\r\nWith the hope that, by making her business profitable and sustainable, she will  be able to reach her dream of graduating her five children from college, Sonia is requesting a larger loan from ASHI.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has always wanted to have his own business and he made this happen 13 years ago when he started up his own business selling flour, sugar, oil and vegetables. He is married and has seven children. This business, apart from being his dream, is the way Tohir can earn a living for his family and educate his children. Starting wasn\u2019t easy, but with his and his family\u2019s hard work, they have been able to get ahead. Tohir has put all of his effort into making his business grow. He is just missing one little push, which is why he needs a loan of 4500 Somoni, which he will use to buy merchandise to stock his store. With this, he hopes to offer a wider variety and better service to his customers, which is how he hopes to ensure that they will prefer his store. This will help him grow as a small business owner. You can be an important part of the development of this store. You can support Tohir and his family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
