She was able to succeed by herself working very hard. She used to sell vegetables and fruits at the municipal market of the city of Ita for 30 years. This was very hard work because she used to commute from a very far away town to the city carrying on her supplies on public transportation. This is why she decided to open her store at home and stop this way with all those years of commuting.\r\nFidelina has a very well stocked grocery store, and all her neighbors buy from her. She is a very gentle lady and her good manners have brought her a large number of customers.\r\nShe needs a loan to increase her business buying beverages, good for animals as many people work on cattle raising around the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Nina Delgado, Kiva

De Las Mercedes Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Members of the \"Virgen D. las Mercedes\" Village Bank live and meet in the town of Churcampa, in Huancavelica, a Department of central Peru. Churcampa is the provincial capital, and is located at 3300 meters above sea level. The zone is chilly, with rugged terrain. Churcampa trades heavily with the nearby city of Huancayo. Most of the community members are involved in commerce, while some farm and raise livestock. Farmers grow corn in Chucuampa\u2019s low-elevation areas, and peas in higher elevation areas. <P>\r\n\r\nFelicitas and Cirila are two members of the \"Virgen D. las Mercedes\" group. Felicitas is married with five children: four of them are in their twenties, while the youngest is 13. Felicitas has a small restaurant, where she also sells sodas. She launched her business a year ago, when some local bank workers asked if she could cook them lunch. Felicitas\u2019 business is going well; the only problem is that it is hard to find time to plant crops on her farm since she is so busy with the restaurant. Loans from FINCA have helped her buy utensils and offer a wider variety of meals and drinks to sell. She plans to use this loan of 500 soles to buy more dry goods (rice, flour sugar) and sodas. Felicitas\u2019 goals for the future are to send her children to college and to expand her business even more. \r\n\r\nCirila is married with four children, who are 28, 24, 21 and 17 years old. She has a small general store that she hopes to expand. She has been running her store for 15 years now, and supports her children with the money she earns. She says that when there was a lot of societal violence in the area (in the 1980s and 1990s, due to conflicts between the armed forces and the Shining Path) it was hard to run the store; she could only stay open until 5pm, since staying open later was unsafe and would make her vulnerable to robberies. She plans to use her loan of 400 soles to improve her business and buy more equipment. Her dreams for the future are for her children to graduate with professional degrees and to open a wholesale dry goods business. Working with FINCA has helped her save money in her savings account, which she plans to use for any difficulties she may encounter in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":242771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buy rice, flour, sugar, sodas, equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-12-21T17:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teofila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Margoth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haide","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leoncia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Paula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodosia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7800,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1299.97},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1299.97},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1299.97},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1299.97},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1299.97},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1300.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":420.82},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":420.82},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":420.82},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.82},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.82},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":420.82,"local_amount":1299.97,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1301.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215302,"comment":null},{"amount":420.82,"local_amount":1299.97,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1301.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397010,"comment":null},{"amount":420.82,"local_amount":1299.97,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1301.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088686,"comment":null},{"amount":841.69,"local_amount":2600.09,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2602.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982045,"comment":null},{"amount":420.85,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1301.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442755,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-24T05:15:44Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:54:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":80643,"name":"Guido","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Guido tiene 40 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casado con Delia que tiene 32 a\u00f1os  y juntos han criado a 4 hijos que tienen 11, 10, 7 y 5 a\u00f1os respectivamente.

Twenty eight years ago he joined together with Bl\u00e1sida, now 45, with whom he has four children. Three of them are grown and the youngest still lives with them. Jose works slaughtering cattle, selling the meat in the butcher shop he runs in his home. At the same time he has a well-stocked store that he set up more than 25 years ago. His wife helps with the business. He says that he is from a humble family and with his father he previously worked making bricks. Thanks to their sacrifice he was able to put together a small capital to set up the store along with his wife. Thanks to this business he achieved economic stability and the possibility of moving forward with his entire family, and also being able to build his own home. Having access to credit, he would invest in the purchase of standing cattle to fatten up and later slaughter in order to sell the meat in his own butcher shop.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

The town sits on the left bank of the Mantaro River at about 2,300 meters above sea level. The weather in the area is very warm.<P>\r\n\r\nMost of the community is involved in commerce or fruit production; the fruit is sold mainly in Huanta. There is also some livestock in the area, including a number of guinea pig farms.<P> \r\n\r\nAlberta and Candelaria are two members of the San Miguel D. Mayocc Village Bank. Alberta is married with four children, who are 20, 16, 14 and 10 years old. She raises and sells guinea pigs, a business she has been involved in for the past three years. At first, the business was difficult, since her guinea pigs had fleas, but now the problem is under control, thanks in part to loans from FINCA, which she used to buy medicine. She plans to use her current loan of 200 soles to fix the irrigation system for her alfalfa, which she grows to feed the guinea pigs. Her dreams for the future are for her children to graduate with professional degrees, and to have a large guinea pig farm. <P>\r\n\r\nCandelaria is married with five children, who are 25, 23, 20, 18 and 16 years old. She also has a guinea pig farm; she buys young animals and fattens them up to resell. Like Alberta, Candelaria had problems when she first started raising guinea pigs because they got sick and died and she didn\u2019t know how to keep them healthy. She has learned a lot about the animals since then, and they don\u2019t get sick any mO.. She plans to use her loan of 500 soles to buy supplements for her guinea pigs, so that she can fatten them up and sell them in the city of Ayacucho.

She had four children with her ex-partner, and they now are 32, 30, 26 and 24 years old respectively. The three oldest children are merchants, have already become independent, and have started their own businesses while the last of her children still lives with her and is the one who helps in the business. Maria is the owner of a well-stocked store that she runs in her own home. She also sells meats and sausages of all kinds. The location of her business is excellent, because it is in a strategic location in the city of It\u00e1. She says that since she was very little she worked selling products of all kinds such as fruits and vegetables that she brought with her mother from the Abasto market in the capital city to sell house to house in the neighborhoods of her city . Subsequently, and with great sacrifice, she managed to set up a small store at home that eventually grew and today is the best-stocked in the neighborhood. She dreams of expanding her business and one day converting it into a large supermarket. At the same time she hopes that some day her youngest daughter will be in charge of the business. At this time she needs a credit to buy more goods such as flour, sugar, rice, noodles, tea, oil, bread, soft drinks, etc. because the end of the year holiday festivities are approaching and sales increase significantly.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva

They have five children together: Reinaldo 23, Carlos 22, Antolina 19, Pedro 16, and Andrea 7 years old. Only the youngest daughter continues her studies because the other children decided to work, leaving their studies aside. All their children still live at home. Meneleo is a farmer, like his wife. They work specifically in horticulture. They started their work in 1990. The beginning was very difficult, because they needed to invest a lot of working capital. With many children it was even harder, but with effort and dedication they managed to get ahead. With much effort and the help of his entire family he was able to move forward and today has a large plantation of greens. His vegetables are very good quality which he says is due to the constant irrigation they receive since the business has a complete underground irrigation system. They sell their products in the fruit and vegetable market of the capital city. Mr. Meneleo requests the loan for the purchase of fertilizer, seeds, insecticides and half shade nets which are of utmost urgency due to the intense heat this summer. Acquiring these items is difficult because of the high cost involved and the low price his vegetables are currently getting in the market.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel

The group works mostly with clothing, making shorts, pants, children's shirts etc. The region is known for it's tailoring and the majority of its population knows the trade. \r\nDo\u00f1a Dania began making clothes when her husband left her with three children.

In order to achieve this dream, they know that they have to manage their loan repayment well so that they become eligible for a larger one.\r\nThe group's members are from the same neighborhood and they support one another's work, helping each other out both with the production and the marketing of their clothing. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":242840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy raw materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Nindiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.004722 -86.119444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2008-12-20T22:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrona Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13076.44,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1452.94},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1452.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9891096,"comment":null},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14814371,"comment":null},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14814372,"comment":null},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349252,"comment":null},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-28T07:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349253,"comment":null},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27036648,"comment":null},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27036649,"comment":null},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":1452.94,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1460.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927091,"comment":null},{"amount":72.24,"local_amount":1452.92,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1459.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927092,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-21T04:51:55Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T09:34:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":80651,"name":"Miurel Del Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Miurel del Rosario C. tiene la edad de 21 a\u00f1os, habita en el barrio Piedra Menuda, ubicado en la ciudad de Masaya, junto a su esposo e hijo de tres a\u00f1os, los planes de do\u00f1a Miurel para su familia son darle una mejor condici\u00f3n de vida.

This group had the opportunity to attend elementary school, so they communicate well and are approachable in society. They started their own traveling businesses, purchasing items in Managua's oriental market and selling them by going house to house in nearby neighborhoods. Rebeca is a wonderful woman and she says she is grateful to Kiva partner ADIM for not only the loan, but also the ability to improve. She feels that the learning experience that she has gotten by working with ADIM has allowed her to realize how valuable a honorable and hardworking woman is. The women use their loans to buy items wholesale for lower prices and increase their profits. They hope to participate in training workshops to improve their businesses. They also want to stay current on their loan payments, as they have done until now, to continue to receive benefits.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Olivia Engkvist, Kiva

They are both neighbors and friends, and they have always worked together and helped each other sell their products. Jessica is the coordinator; she makes tortillas every day in two shifts - the morning and the afternon. She is a single mother of three children who help her bake her products. This group was born out of the necessity to grow their businesses through loans to improve their lives. The women are grateful for both the loans as well as the training they have received over the past two years, through which they have seen their businesses grow and flourish. Jessica's greatest dream is to have a tortilla shop in her home so she can work all day and earn enough so that her children can have good living conditions.

They owe this to Kiva partner ADIM, who has helped them. Their loans have been invested in the purchase of ingredients for baking bread, which is later sold by the dozen in stores. With the loans from ADIM, they have had the opportunity to improve the lives of their families. They have both invested their profits in their businesses as well as used them to fix up their homes.

This is her third loan request, which she'll use to make home improvements and buy three doors, build a closet, and paint the house if there is money leftover. She is beginning the house improvements because a few months ago her husband placed the house in the girls' names and named Mrs. Marbelly as executrix.\r\n\r\nShe is ensuring her daughters will benefit from the house and not be evicted as has happened in other cases.  Once she has paid off this loan, she'll request future loans in order to continue the house improvements until completed, as the house will be for her daughters in the future.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pamela Carre\u00f3n, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":242911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"To buy three doors and build a closet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chontales","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.083333 -85.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marbelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.44,"local_amount":848.7,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":857.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816795,"comment":null},{"amount":40.99,"local_amount":819.71,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":828.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351478,"comment":null},{"amount":100.35,"local_amount":2007.06,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929113,"comment":null},{"amount":141.27,"local_amount":2825.4,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2855.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110600841,"comment":null},{"amount":49.95,"local_amount":999.13,"processed_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123840572,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2526.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128873545,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2526.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136603568,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2526.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639048,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-12T01:47:47Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":80663,"name":"Karen Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sr. Karen tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en el  barrio Laureles Norte, casada,  su esposo trabaja como operario en una empresa, tiene dos preciosos hijos de 6 meses y 4 a\u00f1os de edad, los planes para su familia es mejorar el nivel de vida ofreci\u00e9ndole a sus hijos un futuro diferente.\nDo\u00f1a Karen posee su peque\u00f1o negocio de comida desde hace dos a\u00f1os lo inicio con fondos propios y ahora ya esta estable en el campo de comercializaci\u00f3n.

Because Mr. G. is the eldest son of his father, Nepali culture requires that his father live with them. \r\n\r\nMrs. G. opened the grocery shop 5 years ago to improve the living standards of her family. She sells different types of grocery items in her store such as rice, maize, and noodles. Her children help her in her shop.

She prepares and sells rice with stew and cooked yam in Ejura, a farming community where she lives with her household, and, along with this business, she also sells raw food products like maize in the marketplace of Ejura mostly during their market hours on Mondays. \r\n\r\nThe food that Abiba prepares is a delicacy that many Ghanaians enjoy everyday either as breakfast, lunch or dinner, especially where she lives.

He is 44 years old, married to two wives and father of 7 children -- their ages are 8, 10, 16, 16, 17, 19 and 21 respectively. Besides his own children he also supports a nephew by sending him food.  Financial difficulties lead Artur to quit school after completing the 7th grade. In 1980, he moved to the Maputo province by himself to look for work; there he worked as a housekeeper, and later he worked for the national institute of social sciences. In 1984, he joined the Mozambique\u00b4s defense armed forces and, in 1994, he began his business activities -- he has been involved with many types of businesses since then. Aside from his armed forces career, he also runs a commercial establishment that sells many different kinds of products; beer stands out because a case of it can be bought for 230,00mt and sold for 280,00mt, generating a monthly net income of 1500,00mt. This will be Artur's third loan through Hluvuku and first through Kiva; the previous two loans were used to purchase parts for his vehicle. He wishes to pay back the loan before its term date so he can request another loan that will be used for  home restoration purposes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice,

She is 48 years old, married and has 5 children. She is not responsible for supporting anybody else. Due to financial difficulties, she went to school only until the 2nd grade. She moved from Bilene to Maputo at an early age, settling with her family in the airport area where she met her husband. Rosita runs a used-clothing business without help from anybody else. She buys a bale of used clothing for 2500,00mt and sells them for 3500,00mt, generating a monthly revenue income of 12000,00mt, from which 2700,00mt are saved. This will be Rosita's first loan through Hluvuku and Kiva and she wants to purchase additional stock merchandise with it. In the future she wants to set up a second home-based business dedicated to selling frozen fish; therefore, she will need to invest in a freezer. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

The livestock and straw mats businesses are growing very favorably and provides the family with an income of 2,500,000 VND\/month.  In this round of funding she would like to borrow 9,000,000 VND, part of which will be used to buy more pigs to raise.

He teaches mathematics in his town's secondary school.  His wife is a nurse at the local hospital, where she works with sick patients on the night shift.  On occasion he does not see his wife for a week at a time, and raising six children was no easy matter.  Adullo needed to find other sources of income, and took up driving a cab for a local taxi company.  In the beginning, his fares were in town, but now because the pay is higher he takes on ones further afield, to distant towns and regions throughout Tajikistan. Their children are now grown and each of them earns a living and assists his father, including one son who wires money from Russia.  Since business is good, his son recommended that he sell his current vehicle and seek assistance from MicroInvest for buying a new, more reliable vehicle better suited to mountain driving.  Acting on his son's advice, Abdullo took out a loan and together with the money he had saved purchased an SUV that carries more passengers and makes it easy to drive the mountain passes, both good for his earnings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva

She joined the Fund in 2008 and borrowed money to invest in raising livestock.  Currently, besides he income from raising livestock, the family also has an income stream from making straw mats and her husband's salary from working as labor-for-hire, so the family's finances are quite stable at 2,000,000 VND\/month.  In this round of funding she would like to borrow 6,000,000, part of which will be used to invest in buying more pigs to raise.

Her husband, Mr. Loeng Tol, sells firewood in the local village. Unfortunately, he is now sick and cannot work to support the family. Thus, Mrs. Khom S. decided to ask for a loan to treat her husband's illness. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is a group loan. Two members have end-of-term (EoT) loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Members with EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. EoT loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make their payments many months before the end of the loan term.

However, she would like to continue improving herself (and her business) so her situation will be stable in the future. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan of 3800 Somoni ($1125 USD) that she will pay back in 9 months. With this money, Mavjuda will be able to buy seasonal fabrics for the national dresses. The power to help her business grow is in your hands. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and the mother of three children. Two of her children are in elementary school; the last-born is still breastfeeding. With the help of the government's free compulsory basic education, many mothers have sent their children to school to learn about their future careers. \r\n\r\nShe lives in Ejura, a farming community in the Ashanti region, with her family. Ejura has a mix of all tribes of people, such as the Ashanties, northerners, and the rest. \r\n\r\nShe sells \"gume,\" which is a type of brown rice that is used most often to prepare what we called \"waakye\" (a mixture of rice, beans, tomatoes, and spices). Waakye is enjoyed with stew or shito by many Ghanaians, because of the aroma and the taste. Gume is just an ordinary rice, but it has a different taste and color. Zauyara buys her rice directly from the farmers to avoid middlemen. \r\n\r\nZauyara has been in this business for the past twenty years, and has lots of marketing experience. She inherited this business from her mother, whom she worked with during her childhood. \r\n\r\nZauyara wants a loan to buy more gume to supply her customers, who travel from very far places to purchase it. She believes the loan would help her to support to her children's education better and to revive her business. \r\n\r\nShe is member of the \u201cTrust in God\u201d trust group. Members agree to guarantee for each other as social collateral to repay the loan. She does not sell on group meeting days. and her picture was taken during her group meeting. She would be grateful for your assistance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":244192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To buy gume (brown rice) in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Ejura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"7.383333 -1.366667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2008-12-22T20:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zauyara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":46.15},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":76.92,"local_amount":92.3,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20437896,"comment":null},{"amount":38.46,"local_amount":46.15,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":48.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27132207,"comment":null},{"amount":230.68,"local_amount":276.81,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:36:24Z","rounded_local_amount":290.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44615041,"comment":null},{"amount":38.53,"local_amount":46.24,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":48.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53012091,"comment":null},{"amount":38.46,"local_amount":46.15,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":48.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53012092,"comment":null},{"amount":38.46,"local_amount":46.15,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":48.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63234090,"comment":null},{"amount":38.49,"local_amount":46.2,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:59:55Z","rounded_local_amount":48.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63234091,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-22T22:33:40Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:59:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":80831,"name":"Manija","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":244191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

H., and he is a policeman who works at the police station nearest to her community. Amna baji has two kids: one son and one daughter. Her son works in a factory, while her daughter is in the 3rd standard. <p>\r\n\r\nAmna baji has a medicine sales business. She has 6 years of experience in this business. Specifically, she buys medicines from the wholesale market, and she later sells such medicines to medical stores. She has already successfully repaid one prior loan from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now she is applying for another loan to expand her medicine-selling business. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is the group leader of four other members: (1) Shazia baji wants a loan to buy tools for repairs in connection with her motor workshop; (2) Sugran baji seeks a loan to buy animals (goats and buffaloes) to resell; (3) Shamim akhtar baji requests a loan to buy goods (lentils, cooking oil, and spices) for her food business; and (4) Humaira bano baji would like a loan to buy medicine to resell. <p>\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan: as such, the loan proceeds will be distributed amongst the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. Notably, the members mutually guarantee one another's loans: so, if one member does not promptly repay her portion of the loan, then the other members are responsible for curing the

I. is thirty-five years old and married with three children.  She lives with her family in a town in Ghana called Atebubu.  Atebubu is a farming community.  The inhabitants produce food crops like maize, yams, millet, beans, etc.  Her first born has completed senior high school while the last two are in junior high school.  \r\n\r\nShe sells products like beans, soya beans, groundnuts, rice, etc and other food items like vegetable cooking oil.  She has been in business for twelve years.  Salamatu buys her cereals and other goods from surrounding villages and the farmers in her locality.

She also wants to paint her house so that she can keep it beautiful and it can last for a long time. <p>\r\n\r\nShe sells tiste (a corn and cocoa drink) and beans. She has owned this business for 5 years. The business is located in her house. She decided to start a small grocery store on her own, but didn\u2019t have many clients. From that business, however, she gained the possibility to establish another business, where she would sell beans and tiste. In this way, she earned many clients; both products supplied her with income for her family. As a result, she is requesting this loan for capital for her business. The capital will be used to buy products like corn, cinnamon, and cocoa to make her products in the market since she achieves more favorable results there and at wholesale. \r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":244403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Capital for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-12-22T19:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":893.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858691,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":893.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399946,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:24Z","rounded_local_amount":893.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091932,"comment":null},{"amount":44.99,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":893.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985328,"comment":null},{"amount":45.01,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:54Z","rounded_local_amount":893.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445940,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-22T20:30:10Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":80929,"name":"Hashmud","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hashmud B. is thirty-seven years old.

He is grateful to Fundacion Leon 2000 and its partner organizations for offering him this opportunity to continue moving forward. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":244617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-12-23T03:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Denis Leonel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":23000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1352.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69.12,"local_amount":1352.94,"processed_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1372.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858694,"comment":null},{"amount":69.12,"local_amount":1352.94,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1372.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399949,"comment":null},{"amount":253.71,"local_amount":4966.26,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5037.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091935,"comment":null},{"amount":102.34,"local_amount":2003.27,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2031.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445943,"comment":null},{"amount":99.87,"local_amount":1954.96,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1982.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956588,"comment":null},{"amount":580.84,"local_amount":11369.63,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":11532.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174016,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Her goals are to expand her business so that it grows and in this way she remains active as this has been her greatest income lately. Her wishes are to open a business in a stable locale as she doesn\u2019t have the necessary conditions to open it. She has found it difficult to maintain 2 businesses, which are a bakery and selling clothing, which has been one of the greatest sources of income for her and her family.\r\n\r\nHer work involves the bakery and general merchandise, where she sells items such as pants, shirts, women\u2019s underwear and shirts. It is located in her home, and she has had this business for 4 years. Josefa began this business because her daughter was the one who showed her this business as her daughter used to live in Honduras and learned this work in that country. So Josefa entered into this business and balances now both the bakery and clothing selling. The financing is for working capital so she can buy more clothing for the holiday season and more ingredients to make her products, such as flour, sugar, egg, and firewood.

She is a 25-year-old, married woman with 2 children. One of her children is 5 years old (and attends school), while the other child is 3 weeks old. She rents (and thus resides in) a one-room house, where she lives with three other people. Moreover, Donah takes care of her elderly mother. Although they have electricity, they do not have any piped water at their home. She notes that her family eats three meals a day. <p>\r\n\r\nShe resides and works in a semi-urban area in the outskirts of Kampala. In particular, Donah sells secondhand clothes at the Owino market, one of the busiest markets in Kampala. On a typical day, she can sell clothes to 10 people. Donah explains that she has been in this business for five years and that she works seven days per week. Formerly, Donah worked as a tea girl in a restaurant near her home. Her major challenges, in both life and business, include the following: weather conditions (e.g., the rainy season), business seasonality, feeding her family during difficult times, and business taxes. <p>\r\n\r\nNotably, Donah has been a client of MCDT for 1.5 years, and this is the fourth loan she has sought through the organization. In the future, she would like to expand her business to the point that she can sell her clothes in a wholesale manner.\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":244889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To expand her business by purchasing clothing in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2008-12-23T16:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Donah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zaina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prosy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-30T08:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":43039.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9955807,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-30T08:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":43039.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9955808,"comment":null},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-31T08:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":43039.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9955809,"comment":null},{"amount":390.39,"local_amount":709799.99,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-28T08:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":733191.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14876113,"comment":null},{"amount":90.85,"local_amount":165200,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":170644.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20421691,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

To earn a living, she makes Khmer cake to sell to her customers. Her husband, Mr. Doet Soeung, is a motorbike taxi driver. In order to improve her family's living conditions, Mrs. Sakhorn K. would like to start a pig-breeding business; thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy three piglets for breeding purposes. She is 54 years old, and she is the mother of three children. Two of her children are soldiers, while her youngest child is currently attending the local school. <p>\r\n\r\nThis group loan is comprised primarily of end-of-term (\"EoT\") loans; indeed, three members are seeking such EoT loans, while the other member is requesting a loan whereby regular monthly loan payments are required. The EoT loan is AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor: it allows the borrower to repay portions of the principal whenever he or she is financially able to do so, meaning that the borrower is not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan's term. Even so, most of AMK's clients start making their loan payments many months before the loan's maturity date. Further, nearly all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time; to illustrate, AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva-related loans.

Importantly, this is a group loan: as such, the loan proceeds are distributed amongst the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business; at the same time, the members mutually guarantee one another's loans (i.e., if one member does not promptly repay her portion of the loan, then the other members are responsible for curing the arrears).

Her husband, M. H., is a watchman at a school.

She dutifully saves her income to pay for her children's school\/tuition fees. Notably, she already successfully repaid one prior loan from Asasah (a microfinance institution of Pakistan). Now, she is applying for another loan to buy cosmetics for her daughter-in-law\u2019s parlor. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is the group leader of three other women in her community: (1) Shama nasreen baji wants a loan to buy groceries for her grocery store; (2) Parveen akhtar baji seeks a loan to buy various items (e.g., lentils, cooking oil, and spices) for her food business; and (3) Lubna baji requests a loan to buy medicines to resell. Importantly, this is a group loan: as such, the loan proceeds are distributed amongst the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business; at the same time, the members mutually guarantee one another's loans (i.e., if one member does not promptly repay her portion of the loan, then the other members are responsible for curing the

Also, in the afternoon Shukufa helps her mother-in-law sell various goods in a small shop close to her home. They sell such food items as bread, sugar, pasta, etc. and other things including socks, hats, scarves, and all sorts of knick-knacks. Her mother-in-law goes to the town market for the food-stuffs, and has to go to a different town to get the non-edible things. Shukufa is taking out a loan for the first time, but she really wants to make a large profit before the New Year.

Yakhshiboy spends all of his time at home, tending to his livestock. He feeds and raises it, then sells it at the Chairuhsk market. He thinks that now, while the livestock is cheap, it is absolutely necessary to increase the amount of livestock he has. This is why he's turned to Microinvest. Currently he has 30 rams. His sons help him out with his business. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anya Ezhevskaya, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":244952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"cattle purchase","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.217778 69.725","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2008-12-27T17:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yakhshiboy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:15:09Z","rounded_local_amount":811.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599499,"comment":null},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:59:18Z","rounded_local_amount":811.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52993942,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-27T20:25:55Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:59:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":81088,"name":"Rebecca's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Barikisu buys her goods from farmers in her town and surrounding villages. She says that food vendors buy in large quantities from her.

He is thirty-two years old, married and a father with two kids. Fortunately, both his kids are in school through the help of government free basic compulsory education. <P>\r\n\r\nAmoako lives at Atebubu with his immediate family where he was born and bred. He is a teacher and also sells bags of charcoal. He has been in this business for five years now, earning income to care of his household. <P>\r\n\r\nCharcoal is a very popular source of energy for cooking in many traditional Ghanaian homes. He obtains his supply of charcoal from Awaso which is two towns over from Atebubu where he lives, and he retails it to his customers who come from Kumasi to buy. <P>\r\n\r\nAmoako is a very clever person. He was a student at the University of Development Studies (UDS) in the Northern part of Ghana. He deferred when he was in second year because of financial constraints, thinking that he could get a job that could fetch him high sums of money to pay his fees and other expenses. Unfortunately he could not make it and finally dropped out of school. <P>\r\n\r\nAmoako says he has been affected psychologically.
