She is 48 years old and blessed with four children. Two of them already settled for marriage. The others still attend to school. Rosario is married to Celestino, a farmer in their village. Rosario operates a small store in which she sells sardines, coffee, milk, sugar, and other basic kitchen needs. She had been in this business for four years and earns 1,500 Phillipines pesos (PHP) each week.

Her husband is Larry, a security guard, and father to her two children. The children are studying in high school and elementary. She, together with her husband and children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMary Jane operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 9,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMary Jane hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She lives with her husband in M\u00e9dine-Sikasso. After having run several businesses without success, she has for over two years become familiar with this business of selling onions at the new market in M\u00e9dine, where she has a table. There, she is much in demand by her customers for the quality of her products. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, Ms. Mariam decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two year ago. She is on her fourth loan, which will enable her to increase her business capital in order to buy 20 sacks of onions (10 sacks of small and 10 sacks of large) from a woman who sells in bulk and accepts cash or credit. Ms. Mariam sells her merchandise retail, for cash or on credit, to a customer base composed essentially of women. \r\n\r\nWith this fourth loan, Ms. Mariam envisions making an average monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her business capital, to help with family expenses, and to cover the interest on her loan.\r\n "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":212.5,"image":{"id":921165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"to buy condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-11-18T03:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":34489.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874361,"comment":null},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:48Z","rounded_local_amount":34489.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283183,"comment":null},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":34489.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424691,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T06:29:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":359422,"name":"Dilfuza","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0414\u0438\u043b\u0444\u0443\u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u041d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0438 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0439. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 6000 \u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430  \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430 \u0438 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c.","en":"Dilfuza has been involved in selling seasonal goods for the second year now.

As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are some of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 250 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread, and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAna dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work with her business.

Together with her husband, they raised three children.  After graduating with a journalist major, Gulnara worked in an editorial department of the central, local newspaper.  She moved to the Aral village in 1994 and became the head of the local library, where she still works to this day.  Gulnara's family is involved in animal husbandry as a way to have an additional source of income.  This business was started with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS) and brings in about 6,000 som (KGS) per month today from the sales of dairy products.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Gulnara requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company for the purchase of heifers and cows.  Gulnara plans to invest the profits from the loan into increasing the headcount, which will allow her to expand her business.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":921185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aral village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-18T18:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":25511.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250603,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T22:15:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":359433,"name":"Amelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Amelia, 42, a resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines.

He resides with his family in his own house in Banconi, Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nAfter training as a therapist, he quickly began buying and selling pharmaceutical products and has been doing so for over twenty years. With so much experience in this domain, he has a strong reputation and gets many orders, but he lacks the necessary resources to meet the demand.\r\n\r\nSo he decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution which has already granted him four individual loans, all properly reimbursed. Wanting to further improve his business activity, he is now requesting a fifth loan that will enable him to buy 20 boxes of Manames, 10 cartons of Aloe, 12 cans of Indian inzam, 5 cartons of nifroxacin and 5 cartons of Lipton.\r\n\r\nHis main source of supply is in Lome (Republic of Togo) thanks to the Soro Yiriwaso credit program. Previously, he replenished his stock supply from his supplier in Koutiala. He resells the products in his pharmacy located at the Sikasso bus station, to a client\u00e8le primarily composed of passengers and in particular drivers. Some of his customers pay cash, other are offered credit.\r\n\r\nWith this loan he expects a monthly profit of 375,000 FCFA. The profits will serve to deal with most of his expenses, those of his family, pay interest on the loan and reinvest the rest in his business activity.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":393.75,"image":{"id":921191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural

The loan will be used to purchase more food items for resale, and will help Rosemary to generate greater profits and pay for her family's medical expenses. Rosemary hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nRosemary is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

For the past two years, Scoria has been working hard to manage her small stand, which sells fresh fruit. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Scoria has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more fruit to sell and will help Scoria to generate greater profits and pay for her children's school fees. Scoria hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nScoria is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Scoria's future prospects by helping her to learn how to budget and save

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit, and insurance.\r\nWith income from maize sales, Gilbert will educate his children, ensure food security, and invest in livestock rearing.

Before joining One Acre Fund, Winnrose was only able to harvest 2 bags of maize on half an acre of land.\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Winnrose and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit, and insurance.\r\nWith income from maize sales, Winnrose will pay for major annual expenses, such as school fees for the children.

This  group joined Kiva partner One Acre Fund in the year 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program.\r\nAmina is the facilitator of the Peace Maker group. She takes care of six children at home. She joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for her family. In the recent 2011 season, Amina had an excellent maize yield harvesting 10 bags on half an acre of land.

In her father's workshop, Sandra gained experience and trained in dressmaking, working in this job for 13 years.  Motivated by the need to provide for her 11-year-old daughter, at 31 years of age Sandra decided to start working for herself.

She takes good care of her children and is seen as something of a role model among the women in her neighbourhood."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":489.72,"image":{"id":609976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy children's outfits, diapers, and other clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:02:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Philomene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":36700},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":38400},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":39300},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":40200},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":41100},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":42100},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43000},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":44000},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":45000},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46100},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":46600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.07},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.64},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.3},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":155.82,"local_amount":74200,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:25:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75869.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250810420,"comment":null},{"amount":163.17,"local_amount":77700,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":79448.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257219060,"comment":null},{"amount":170.73,"local_amount":81300,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:56:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83129.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263357090,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-02T02:45:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":359632,"name":"Yahia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yahia's group is comprised of two hard-working women.

After that, he goes to work in his fields for 5 hours, and in the afternoon, he works as a day laborer.\r\n\r\nTomas must take two buses in order to get to the city where he purchases agricultural inputs and feed for his cattle. After obtaining the inputs, he returns and must walk on foot to arrive at his house.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, in order to purchase agricultural inputs for his fields and to purchase a pair of oxen so that he can transport the inputs and the cattle feed to his residence.\r\n\r\nWith this investment, Tomas will be certain to adequately care for his crops on time, and sell them at a better price.  Additionally, it will facilitate transporting the crops to his home. He will have a wagon made for the oxen to pull and transport the inputs.\r\n\r\nWith the income he will receive, he hopes to repair his home because it needs doors and windows. They are currently covered with sheets, which makes him feel unsafe. He would like to have metal doors and windows.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":921481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase agricultural inputs for his fields and to purchase a pair of oxen.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":359635,"name":"Teopista's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teopista's group is comprised of two hard-working women.
