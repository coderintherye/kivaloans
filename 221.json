Together with her husband they try to advance their family. Cosmetics sales is a very difficult occupation, especially because she has to roam the streets and to go clients' homes daily, most being friends and family who place orders every second week. She tries to visit the steady clients more frequently. But she still heads out to other places to engage new people and increase her sales. It is difficult to manage her time because she also has to manage her household responsibilities, even before going out into the streets. Carito is trying to improve her sales so that she might be able to take some days off together with her husband. She hopes to set up another business in partnership with him, selling drinks.

He has a business raising cattle, but also works as a metalworker at a vehicle depot. It is heavy work, but feeding his new family is a must. His uncle helps transport the cattle to market. Abduvohid started this business on his uncle's advice.  He took out his first loan in 2006 to purchase one head of cattle.

","en":"Gavhar K. was born in 1963. She is married and has two children, but did not go to college. She came to MicroInvest in 2006 for a loan, which she spent to expand her business. For nearly 12 years, she has sold candy and other sweets at the market. When she received her first loan, she had to put on a wedding, but did not want to take the money out of her working capital, so she decided to apply for a loan. She was able to put on the wedding, and her business continued to grow. In the past she dealt in small items, but thanks to Kiva has increased her turnover dramatically.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva

","en":"Monadniso was born in 1983; she is married and has 2 children.  She finished teaching college.  After that she got a job at her village school and works as a teacher.  Her salary not being enough led her to raising livestock at home.  Previously her husband kept livestock for personal needs.  Now due to a lack of resources they started a livestock business.  A year ago after discussing it with her husband, she bought 2 cows so that they could fatten them and resell them later.  They were left with good profits from this; they still continue to grow this business and are grateful to KIVA for this.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva

He is married and is a father of three children. His wife does not work. She stays at home and does housework and feeds the cattle. Muhtorali breeds and sells cattle. The summer is the season to buy cattle for Muhtarali because in the spring the cattle and fodder cost cheaper. So he does not have to spend a lot. The cattle eats mountain grass and Muhtorali saves on the fodder. With the arrival of winter he sells part of the grown cattle, but he does not buy more. He buys fodder for feeding of the rest of the cattle.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":323358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Feeding and selling of cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-29T00:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhtorali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":754.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001220,"comment":null},{"amount":175,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":754.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846380,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-30T00:16:35Z","paid_date":"2009-12-25T09:21:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":110199,"name":"Merlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\" I started my business using my own savings of Php 2,000.

L. is from the village of Mansabay.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Zoila has been engaged in her business for over 9 years and earns approximately 500 PHP a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Zoila joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Zoila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Zoila is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 15th loan taken out by Zoila from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:<P>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Saidahmad is an ordinary man in the district of Rudaki in Tajikistan. He is a very responsible person who since his youth has been running a livestock farm with the goal of supporting his family, his wife and 3 children. Saidahmad needs to purchase calves and goats to reproduce them and maximize his profits by selling their milk and meat. Once he has these products from his flock he sells them in his neighborhood and in this manner he is able to support his family. For this reason, Saidahmad is turning to you for the support that would permit him to continue developing his business.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a 32-year-old married mother of three children. Her husband is an entrepreneur and Muyassar started her business five years ago in order to support her family. All year she sells fruit that she buys from local farmers. Twice a week, Muyassar travels over 60 km to sell her produce at attractive prices at the busy market. With the loan of $1500 USD from Kiva, she plans to increase the range of her selling goods, and to buy more fruit to sell. Muyassar strives to give her children a better life than she has, including supporting them through a good education. Muyassar is a well-spoken, friendly businesswoman who is worthy of the support of Kiva partners.   \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Maret is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maret joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maret is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase a fishing boat. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Maret from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is taking out a loan for turnover in her livestock business. At present she has four cows and ten sheep. She wants to use this next loan to purchase feed for her sheep. According to Musharaf, she has MicroInvest to thank for the constant turnover in cattle, the fattening and selling that provides her with an income. Her husband handles selling the cattle; when a steer is ready for sale he takes it to the market and sells it for a good price. In turn, he purchases a younger and leaner steer, which Musharaf again fattens and prepares for sale.

As a mother and wife she tries to balance her diverse roles by being responsible and loving, especially in her house since that is where her children grow and develop.  She sells sweets on foot, focusing on school entrances and parks where there is a lot of foot traffic and many customers to sell her sweets to.  She started selling sweets on foot 3 years ago when she was on hard times and needed a way to pay for her household expenses.  She has been able to save money and plans to open a storefront in the entrance to her house once she has enough funds to do so.  Until then, she begins work at 7 in the morning and works until 6 every day.  This is her 6th loan with MFP.  She works closely with the members of her community bank, whom she respects and collaborates with.  With the loan for 1000 soles she will increase the amount of products she sells and will be able to accomplish her goal of opening a storefront.      \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matthew Raimondi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":323628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lim","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-25T22:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":148.06},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":157.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":161.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":169.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":178.24},{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":185.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.43},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":51.82,"local_amount":148.06,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":155.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990605,"comment":null},{"amount":55.15,"local_amount":157.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":165.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211716,"comment":null},{"amount":56.43,"local_amount":161.22,"processed_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:39Z","rounded_local_amount":169.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641237,"comment":null},{"amount":59.42,"local_amount":169.78,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":178.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080678,"comment":null},{"amount":62.38,"local_amount":178.24,"processed_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":187.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996811,"comment":null},{"amount":64.8,"local_amount":185.14,"processed_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":194.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842180,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-26T00:30:57Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":110317,"name":"Juana Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nLa se\u00f1ora Juana R. se dedica a atender en su negocio de venta de frutas y verduras en el mercado Mayoreo donde a diario desde muy temprano abre su tramo para ofrecer los perecederos a sus clientes.\n\nEl motivo por el cual ella ha acudido a Ceprodel es para ser beneficiada con un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de dichas frutas y verduras por lo que espera en que Ceprodel le proporcionar\u00e1 el cr\u00e9dito lo m\u00e1s pronto posible para invertir en el negocio.\n\n","en":"Juana R. tends to her business of selling fruits and vegetables in the wholesale market.

Her ability to make friends quickly has helped her to use her free time to do productive activities like set up a phone call service in her town, a business that she has been developing for 2 years with some friends.  The difficult part of this work is the risk of muggings, as she has a number of cell phones due to the volume of customers who request her services.

She is married and she has two children.  The first is still studying in preparatory school, and the other is not.  Her husband works and he helps her with the expenses of the family, and also he sometimes helps her in her business.  It has been about three and a half years since she began a business selling fruit.  Later she began another business selling traditional clothing like g\u00fcipiles and shorts.  She sells products on market days, or on Wednesdays and Sundays of each week, in the city plaza of her area.  The loan that she is asking for is to invest in and stock her business, buying more merchandise like aprons and sweaters, because it\u2019s the season for them.  Her dream is to grow her business and to be able to get a location in the city plaza, and also to have a better life with her children now while they are little.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She married, and the fruit of this union is the four children she had. Confident that the sale of beers and sodas would generate a good income, she began a business two years ago. Her good relations, courtesy and the joy that she transmits brought in customers, and demand grew, exceeding her goals and increasing her workload. Trinidad has new goals, including the installation of a bar in the center of her district. She is looking for a location in an attractive neighborhood with a lot of recreation and shopping centers so that she will benefit from the numbers of people. She will achieve this with the support of her partner, who has involved himself unconditionally in the labor that this will entail. This is Trinidad\u2019s eighth loan with the MFP. Together with her colleagues in the communal bank, they have perseverance and patience as keys to the development of their work.

Thanks to the work of her husband, they have a house to live and settle in. When she married, she began to worry about their finances, since their needs grew, and her partner couldn\u2019t afford the costs that their children demanded. For this reason she began to work as a traveling salesperson. Three years ago, she began to sell clothes and kitchen utensils from door to door to obtain necessary experience. Since one year ago, she began to work in orders at the end of every month, and she only sold in the streets on weekends at the markets. Now, thanks to the support of her partner, she is finishing the construction of her home where she hopes to invest various years of savings to install a grocery store. This is her first loan with MFP. It is opening the doors to progress and establishing new relationships with the women in her community bank. With the 1000 soles, she will buy merchandise, since her orders have grown, and she doesn\u2019t have the necessary capital to cover the investment.

Felicia understands business ethics and knows that customers are her income so she provides good quality and excellent service.  She prepares and sells local foods like fufu, banku and other dishes. Fufu is prepared from pounded cassava and plantain, and is generally eaten with different kinds of soup.  Banku is prepared from milled maize grains and is eaten with hot pepper sauce or soup.  Felicia has attracted lots of customers with her tasty meals, and it has become necessary to employ additional hands to assist her in her food delivering service.  Also, Felicia says prices of raw materials have gone up significantly and she needs the support of a loan to help meet her production costs.

She lives with her partner in a rented home.  She is the mother of a 3 year old girl, who is the motivation for her efforts. Her business is the purchase, care and sale of guinea pigs. The meat from her guinea pigs is in high demand at Sunday fairs because she feeds them well and ensures they grow to a good size.  To do this, she gets up very early each day to cut grass to feed them.  She prevents them from eating oats and alfalfa which is stored for months when there is drought.  Nelly cares for her little animals with a lot of love, as she knows that it is thanks to them that she brings in money to meet her needs.  \r\n\r\nThe two years she has spent in this business have taught her to care for her animals and keep them parasite free in order to offer healthy meat to all her customers.  In the future, Nelly hopes to increase the number of guinea pigs that she has, and to build appropriate cages for them.  She finds that the most difficult part of her work is to root out bad weeds in the grass that she uses to feed the animals, because if she doesn't the guinea pigs that eat them will die.  Nelly proudly shows us her guinea pigs in this photo.  \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP, and she is committed to making payments on the dates scheduled by her loan advisor.  The money that she is requesting will be used to have cages built for her many guinea pigs.  With this she will be able to select them according to size.  She will also purchase concentrated feed for the development and fattening up of her little animals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":323696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of feed and construction of cages ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-26T05:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641244,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-26T10:06:07Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":110348,"name":"Aba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aba D. is a 38-year-old married mother of two children.

He lives happily with his wife, the mother of his 5 children, three of whom are still with them and help him work the fields. He sows and harvests potatoes, daily work that he has been carrying out for the last 30 years. But even before he starts tending to his fields he must feed the his donkey and his mules. They help him transport the large sacks of harvest.  By 8a.m. the animals must already be well fed so that they do not feel tired or become hundre during the trip to and from the silos. After having collected the potatoes he and his wife must go through a selection process, and only then will they transport them to the wholesale markets in the city of Tarma. Miclerio loves his work and it is thanks to this work that he obtains money to support his family. In the 30 years that he has been working he has enjoyed abundant harvests, giving him the opportunity to live through times of plenty. He has also seen harvests fall under a sheet of ice and other harvests that were completely spoiled by pests. But these times of hardship have been temporary and they have not impeded his will to keep struggling for the sake of his family. This is the fourth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner).

He lives at home with his parents, where he shares a room with his younger brothers. Ever since he was quite young, Walberto has helped his parents farm, since he realized that his siblings are very young and are busy with their studies. For this reason, he decided to start planting potatoes on rented farmland, which he pays for on an annual basis. The first few years were not very profitable, so he switched to irrigated land, where his potatoes grow better and he can produce abundant harvests. He takes very good care of his land, since his income depends on his production, and this way he can help support his younger siblings. Walberto takes pleasure in his work, and borrows his parents' donkeys so that he can transport the many sacks of potatoes he has accumulated to a lower-elevation area, then to the city of Tarma, where he will sell them. \r\n\r\nThis is Walberto's fourth loan from Microfinanzas PRISMA; he has repaid all of his previous loan installments punctually. Walberto is very funny and clever and always knows how to make the other members of his village bank laugh. In this loan cycle, he has reiterated his commitment to making all of his payments on time. The 2000 soles he is requesting will be used to help him produce a more bountiful harvest. He will buy everything he needs for planting potatoes so that he will feel that he is helping out his siblings even more than he currently is.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":323700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Incremento de su producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-26T16:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641246,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-26T22:29:04Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":110351,"name":"Mamuna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mamuna A. is 34 years-old.

She lives in the 2 de Mayo neighborhood in an unnumbered house in Catac District, Recuay Province, Ancash Department. She is married and has six children. Just one of her daughters still lives at home, since her other children all have families of their own. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan of 300 soles, Flora bought a ram so that she could sell the meat in the Lima - Huamantanga Market. She has been a member of her village bank for the past three years, and is very grateful because she has learned to save and learned about the concept of solidarity, among other things. \r\n\r\nAt present, Flora has the same business selling meat in Lima. She and her husband support one another; he also works as a vendor in Lima, selling vegetables and potatoes that he brings from the Callej\u00f3n de Huaylas Valley.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of 800 soles, Flora will buy more rams to sell their meat by the kilo so that she can increase her income. She feels like an accomplished woman, since five of her children are now working professionals and her youngest daughter is in school.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":323742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"Buy rams to sell for meat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huaraz - Ancash","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.533333 -77.533333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-05-27T22:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":137.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44591072,"comment":null},{"amount":45.95,"local_amount":133.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":138.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985358,"comment":null},{"amount":45.71,"local_amount":132.99,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":137.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205772,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":137.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73634999,"comment":null},{"amount":45.95,"local_amount":133.68,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":138.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074066,"comment":null},{"amount":45.73,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":137.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989522,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-28T04:03:29Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T02:10:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":110366,"name":"Celia Agripina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Celia Agripina G.

She is married, but is the sole bread-winner for the family right now. She lives in Nyalenda slum here in Kisumu.  She runs a vegetable kiosk that is located next to a beauty salon (pronounced saloon in Kenya). The challenges she faces are fluctuations in the purchasing power of her customers. She hopes to use half the loan for personal use (we were told off camera: school fees) and the other half for increasing her food stocks for her kiosk. She asked that K-MET increase the amount of business training that they give borrowers.<P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Rose saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Rose  responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end,  you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you\" and Erokamano, which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting.

For the last four years, her main task, very early in the morning, is to clean her farm and feed her animals.  She raises chickens and guinea pigs, which she sells on the weekends from her home.

Because of the demand for Internet access, she decided 2 years ago to start a business providing public Internet booths.  For this, she outfitted some space that her in-laws provided inside their home.  Soledad tends to her business each and every day in order to generate the necessary income for the household, renting her computers out on an hourly basis.  Her business has been fruitful so far, as it is the only such service in her area.  This motivates her to continue to progress and upgrade her machines so she can offer a better and faster service.  This is her first loan with MFP, and her first experience in a cooperative bank.  Regardless, Soledad has a great desire to work in a team environment with all of her colleagues.

F. is from the town of Tudela, Misamis Occidental. She is 34 years old and widowed with four school-aged children. To make a living, Rother makes and sells food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling dried goods in the local community. Rother has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Rother joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rother has successfully repaid a previous loan of 28000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Rother is requesting a new loan of 28000 PHP which will be used to again purchase raw ingredients. This loan will be the sixth taken out by Rother from PMPC.

Purita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional ingredients for the food she sells in her carenderia. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Purita from GDMPC.

is a resident of Purok (district) Namnama Magsaysay, Naguillan, Isabela.

They are blessed with three children; Marjorie, the eldest, is 20 years old and presently studying in college, Jenny Rose is 18 years old and is also studying in college, finally Victor M. Jr., is 16 years old and will graduate from high school next year. As a mother who dreams for all of her children to finish their studies, she will do everything to provide for their needs. Their studies are her priority, and she is willing to sacrifice to reach their goals in life, for she believes their goals are also her goals and that their success someday will also be her success.\r\n\r\nMarites cooks snacks like \u201cpansit\u201d out of her snack house in her village. Sometimes, she also sells house to house and fortunately she is generating enough income to sustain their daily needs. She is again hoping for a loan of PHP 5,000. This little amount will provide the capital she needs in her business. Marites hopes that she will manage to continuously support the financial needs of her two children who are studying in college. Their tuition fees are very high and she is really working hard just to pay their tuition fees in school and provide them their daily allowances. By patience, Marites believe, she will overcome the hardship of life.

She attended school through the 7th grade due to difficult financial circumstances of her parents. She is the mother of a 7-year-old child who is studying in elementary school.\r\n<p>\r\nAtalia was only 6 months old when she left Maputo to go to Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, due to her parents' separation. She began to live in her aunt's house, who was abusive to her. She started school very late and when she was in 7th grade, she became pregnant and was kicked out of her house. She then had to stop going to school. The same year, she was able to arrange a job at a Sondela-style restaurant and worked for 4 years. She had to quit her job when she became ill with turberculosis and had to complete the treatments over the course of a year. After her recovery, she arranged a job at the Namaacha Water company. As a permanent employee for over 3 years, she earns 2500 per month.\r\n<p>\r\nDue to the death of her husband, she has not been able to take care of her expenses because she lives in a rented home where she pays 800 meticais per month and also takes care of her mother. Her mother lives in Gaza Province, so she sends her 500 meticais per month to pay the woman who takes care of her, since she is very elderly. She approached Hluvuku and requested a loan in the amount of 8000 meticais to purchase land. She repaid that amount successfully and is at this time requesting 12,000 meticais to start construction.\r\n<p>\r\nThis Atalia's second loan from Hluvuku and the first with Kiva. She used the first 8000 meticais loan to purchase land and is requesting this second loan of 12,000 meticais to start construction of her own home. She is confident that she will repay the loan before the stated loan term and ask for another to furnish the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by N Aviva, Kiva

He is 25 years old and single. Currently, he lives with his three younger siblings and their mother.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter two years of study in Manhi\u00e7a, he graduated with a teaching degree, with authorization to teach primary school classes in that district. Years later, he transferred to Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, where he works at the Maria Auxiliadora School. Evandre grew up in a Catholic family, attending mass every weekend. Due to his passion for music, he has also been invited to work in the Department of Cultural in Namaacha's District Administration. He currently works from 7:30 am to 3:30 pm planning and organizating the district's cultural calendar, focused on the area of music. \r\n<p>\r\nIn financial terms, nothing has changed, Evandre continues to be employed by the government and earns a base salary of 4700 meticais per month. He hasn't been able to save for buying a home at all due to the expenses he has to take on. Currently, his mother and sister, with a daughter, live with him.\r\n<p>\r\nWhile Evandre is happy with the progress of his professional life, he feels that the salary is not adequate to realize his dream (building his own home). He is aware that if he loses his job, his family will not have a place to live. So, he has decided to ask for his first loan from Hluvuku, after hearing about it from his sister who is also a Hluvuku client.\r\n<p>\r\nThese 10,000 meticais will be used to buy construction material and provide continuity to the construction. He already has the land, sand and stones, in addition to drawings approved by the architect. In the future, Evandre would like to be able to build a studio next to his home to be able to play with friends, and who knows, even record his own songs.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Evandre's second loan from Hluvuku and Kiva. The first 10,000 meticais were used to buy construction material. These additional 10,000 meticais will be used for the same purpose. He plans to repay without any problem and is very happy since at the end of this year, he will go to live in his own home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by N Aviva, Kiva

He is the father of 2 children, the first aged 4, and a newborn who is just one week old. The oldest attends a nursery school.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Luis started to work as a primary teacher at a school in Matsequenha in the same district. During 2008, he was transferred to work as an asset manager in the District Administration Office of Education in Namaacha. His monthly salary is 4700 meticais, and he works from 7 am to 3:30 pm except Saturdays and Sundays. He hasn't been able to save at all at the end of the month because he is still building his home, as he lives with his family at his parents' house. Luis is trying to get construction material, which is difficult for him at his salary. \r\n<p>\r\nHe found out about Hluvuku from one of his cousins who was a Hluvuku client. He then approached Hluvuku to request a loan in the amount of 10,000 meticais to continue with his building project, but due to the high prices for material, he was not able to complete it. He is requesting Hluvuku's services once again. In addition to his children, he cares for his parents, giving them support every 3 months in the amount of 1000 meticais.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Lu\u00eds's second loan from Hluvuku and Kiva. The first 10,000 meticais were used to buy construction material and he is asking for 15,000 meticais for the same purpose. He is confident that he will repay before the end of the loan term and will ask for a new loan to paint and do electrical work. His goal is to continue on his career path.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by N Aviva, Kiva

He is 27 years old and single with no children. He attended school through the 10th grade and he received training as an elementary teacher.\r\n<p>\r\nHe left Gaza Province for Namaacha, a town on the border with Swaziland, with his parents after his father was transferred through his work in education. After completing primary education, his mother advised him to enroll in the training course for primary teachers as a fast path to entering the job market. Fulgencio completed the course in two years and quickly went to work as an administrator in the District Administration Office of Education in the same town of Namaacha. He has been working for three years and earns a salary of 4700 meticais monthly. He has not been able to save because he is building his residence in the town of Boane, which is located 75 km away from the town of Namaacha. he has not been able to complete the construction, so he approached Hluvuku requesting a loan to continue the work. He obtained this with a little bit of difficulty due to lack of collateral, but with the help of his uncle as a backer, he was able to overcome this barrier and continue the work. He takes care of his mother and his two younger siblings who live in the city of Maputo by sending them 1000 meticais per month. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Fulgencio's second loan from Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. The first 10,000 meticais were used to buy construction material to start the project, since he already has part of the land. This additional 10,000 meticais will be used to continue the same building project. He is confident that he is going to repay before the loan term and take another loan to furnish the house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by N Aviva, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":324055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase construction material","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-05-30T01:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fulgencio J\u00falio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":542.59},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":564.89},{"due_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":588.1},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":612.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":637.43},{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":663.63},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":690.9},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":719.3},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":748.86},{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":779.63},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":811.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":845.03},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":879.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":915.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.35},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.18},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.96},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.9},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.91},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.97},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.08},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.24},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.44},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.69},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.99},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.35,"local_amount":542.59,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:24:26Z","rounded_local_amount":552.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52971133,"comment":null},{"amount":21.18,"local_amount":564.89,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":575.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63190960,"comment":null},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":588.1,"processed_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":598.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73618841,"comment":null},{"amount":119.96,"local_amount":3198.89,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3256.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056683,"comment":null},{"amount":43.92,"local_amount":1171.29,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1192.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971634,"comment":null},{"amount":53.22,"local_amount":1419.16,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1444.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816619,"comment":null},{"amount":51.73,"local_amount":1379.41,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1404.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708777,"comment":null},{"amount":42.59,"local_amount":1135.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1156.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937689,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-30T06:20:18Z","paid_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":110525,"name":"Saima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saima C. sells smoked fish at the market and is requesting a loan to buy more smoked fish to sell.

medium-sized wooden house located in Kompong Cham Province belongs to Mrs. Chhem C., age 34, who has been establishing a family with the other family members. She is married with five children who are single, while her husband is a domestic construction worker.

P., a resident of Tipolo, is 35 years old, married, and the mother of two school-aged children.

Having repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC used to purchase materials needed to provide service, she is now requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used both to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be Fe\u2019s third loan from PMPC, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is a 27-year-old married man and has a 6-year-old daughter who is in the 2nd grade. \r\nWiliamo has passed through some difficult times. When he was a child his older sister invited him to live with her in Swaziland. Upon his arrival he began his studies. While attending the 3rd grade his father sent for him, claiming his son could not live so far from his twin brother. When in Namaacha, he managed to enroll in school and later completed the 10th grade. Due to his hard work in school he is solicited for a job at the local community radio station located in the secondary school building as a radio announcer during the hours of 6-8 where he made 1500.00mt monthly. Years later he became involved with a local honey production venture financed by the Namaacha district government. The funding was valued at 125000.00mt for a group of 6 people who were reimbursed every 3 months at 12000.00mt during a period of 11 months. However he was not able to meet these expectations due to poor weather conditions. For this reason he solicits a loan worth 15000.00mt from Hluvuku in order to begin his own business acquiring honey from Inhambane and reselling it in Namaacha. Each trip he purchases 80 liters of honey and resells each liter at 120, obtaining a monthly profit of 6000.00mt. \r\nAlong with his daughter, Wiliamo is responsible for the care of his mother with whom he resides. \r\nThis is Wiliamo's third loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. The first two were used to purchases products for resale. The current loan will be used to start a new business selling honey in local communities. He is very confident that he will pay back his loan before the deadline and that he will ask for a new loan to strengthen his business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

He completed his studies through the 10th grade. He lives with his wife and is a father of two children, a 5-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter. The oldest attends preschool. <p>\r\nAfter completing the 10th grade, he enrolls in a teacher's development course where he was not admitted. Years later he leaves Inhambane for Maputo where his father worked. His father had divorced his mother. When he arrives in Maputo he gets a job in the civil registry. His good performance allowed for his promotion to technical assistant and consequent transfer to Namaacha, a town on the Swaziland border. He has worked for more than 10 years and receives 3257.00mt monthly, a salary that does not allow for a basic living standard. His desire to build his own house has lead him to ask for a loan in order to begin construction 75km outside of Namaacha. <p>\r\nAlong with his children he is responsible for the care of his mother with whom he resides in Chimoio. He sends her 1000.00mt every 3 months. <p>\r\nThis is Zeca's third loan with Hluvuku and the first with Kiva. The first two were used to purchase construction material to begin work on his house. The loan will be used to finish construction. Zeca believes that he will pay back the loan before the deadline and that he will ask for a new loan to perform maintenance on the house. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Marco

From 1984-1990, through hard work and good managing, she came to diversity her business by including sugar, kerosene, etc... which totaled $200.  From 1990-2002, she diversified again by including hair extensions that increased her capital to $1,150.  From 2002-2006, she ran into difficulties with the turnover of goods in her district due to saturation.  \r\n\r\nWhat has carried her from 2006 to today was opening another sales outlet outside her district.  Currently her business generates a monthly profit of $220.  Her ambition is to open a pharmacy because of the demand, which is big in her area west of Kinshasa. \r\n\r\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se is 47 years old, married, and the mother of four children, ages 18 to 29.  The eldest is on his own, and the other three are students.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

A personal secretary by training, she essentially invested herself, upon marrying, into commercial business, notably in incense and clothing.  She enjoys an enormous reputation today, especially during the marriage season, among women in S\u00e9gou. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of augmenting her working capital, in order to satisfy her burgeoning customer base, she turned toward Soro Yiriwaso, with which she has been associated for 42 months.  After two individual loans and three solidarity loans, all correctly repaid, she is now on her third individual loan.  This new loan will be used to buy a bolt of rich damask fabric, two bolts of less-rich damask, and ten bolts of Hitarget <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth).  Supplies are gotten from wholesalers at the grand marketplace of Bamako (capital of Mali).  Sales are made at the retail level out of her home, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed of men and women. \r\n\r\nShe intends to realize an average monthly profit of 50,000 francs CFA that will be put into savings, covering certain expenses, and repaying the loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She lives with her husband and children in the Missira neighborhod of the town of  S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). <P>\r\n\r\nNever having attended school because of socio-economic reasons, she had very religious parents who saw the \"white man's school\" as the road to perdition. Since she was very young, she busied herself with petty trading, working with her mother who sold rice. Rich in experience gained at her mother's side, she decided after her marriage to go out on her own and has been in business for 20 years, selling various items (thermos bottles, prepaid phone cards, dishes, shoes, portable phones, etc.) and has a very good reputation. <P>\r\n\r\nIt is with the intention of increasing her working capital that she joined Soro Yiriwaso, 30 months ago. After 1 individual loan and 3 solidarity loans, all correctly reimbursed, she is on her second individual loan which will be used to buy 50 thermos bottles, 10 pairs of shoes, 3 dozen bowls, 10 portable phones, and a carton of prepaid phone cards from \"Orange\" cell telephone server. She buys her telephones and rechargeable cards in Bamako; her thermos bottles, bowls and shoes come from Ghana. She sells for cash and credit, out of her home and door-to-door, to a clientele composed primarily of men. She expects to make an average monthly profit of 70,000 F CFA which will be used to add to her savings, buy some animals little by little, and reimburse the loan. <P>\r\n\r\nHer ambition is to save as much as possible so as to build a house to live in. \r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

He lives in a traditional family with his parents in the Darsalam neighborhood of S\u00e9gou (4the region of Mali).<P>\r\n\r\nHaving left school at a young age, he began early on to work to earn his living. Thus, he began to make repairs on electronic apparatus and household appliances in Gambia where he had gone to see the world. Since he returned to his native land, 6 years ago, he has continued the same business. He has his workshop in the Darsalam neighborhood alongside the National Road, 200 meters from the new bus station of  S\u00e9gou. He has a good reputation and is considered quite a genius at repairing electrical gadgets, even though he just picked up his know-how along the way. <P>\r\n\r\nWith the intention of adding to his turnover, he came to Soro Yiriwaso 7 months ago. After a first individual loan, correctly reimbursed, he is on his second which he intends to use to buy 100 panels, 100 telephone batteries and 100 chargers. He does his buying in Bamako (capital of Mali). Mr. Amadou D. sells for cash or credit to a clientele composed of men and women, young and old. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan he expects to make a monthly profit of 75,000 F CFA which will permit him to reimburse his loan and help his family. His ambition is to become involved in trade between Mali and the rest of the world. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

A retired health technician, she came into commerce thanks to her mother, who used to sell grains.  She started her income-generating business with the knitting of clothing for children, commerce in various goods, etc.  \r\n\r\nShe very soon opted for making and selling local non-alcoholic juice drinks and ice cream.  She has been in this business for a dozen years and enjoys great fame in her area, and even in the city of S\u00e9gou.  To make juices, she uses 2 kg of sugar, 4 bags of juice powder, 6 bags of vanilla sugar, and some flavorings.  \r\n\r\nIn order to buy a large-capacity freezer for satisfying her customers, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso 36 months ago.  After four solidarity loans and an individual loan, all correctly repaid, she is now on her second individual loan.  This loan will be used to buy a freezer, locally in S\u00e9gou, from merchants who specialize in household appliances. \r\n\r\nMs. D. makes her sales out of her home and door-to-door, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed of men, women, and children.  She intends to realize an average monthly profit of 37,000 francs CFA that will be put into savings and covering certain family expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Karima is a very hard-working, and her diligence is incredible. She looks for a way to provide extra income to her home. \r\n<p>\r\nKarima wakes up early every morning to feed her cows and bulls.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in a monogamous family with her husband and children in the Darsalam I district of the city of Koutiala (Sikasso Region). A teacher in a Koutiala public school for over ten years, she also earns revenues from business, particularly the dyeing of cloth and selling dyed damask fabrics, that she learned from one of her service colleagues seven years ago.  She offers a range of cloth dyeing services for many requestors in her district and in the city.  She also receives orders from different professional organizations of Koutiala and from third parties. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy her customers and to generate more profit, she decided to turn towards the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two months ago.  She is on her first individual loan, which will be used to buy five bolts of medium-rich damask, colorants (dyes), and some potash.  Supplies are gotten at the grand marketplace of Koutiala and often in Bamako (capital of Mali).  Sales are made in Koutiala City (in professional state organizations as much as in private organizations and in her district) to customers composed of women and men, cash or credit accepted. \r\n\r\nShe is counting on realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used for repaying the loan, for supporting herself, and for investing the rest in her business.  Looking ahead, she intends to open a center for apprentices in cloth dyeing that demands sizable funding.  Her hopes rest upon Soro Yiriwaso and its partner, Kiva, for this plan to be realized.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In 2001, the city passed a decree forbidding restaurants near the university and put an end to her activity.<P>\r\n\r\nFrom 2001 till today, Jacquie has been selling spices in the market and has opened another restaurant at the same place. In 2006, she decided to join one of the HOPE groups called \"Bomoko\", which means \"unity\", hoping to realize her dream of one day opening a grocery store. She is a faithful client of HOPE. She has received 7 loans that she reimbursed in a timely manner. <P>\r\n\r\nJacquie is 30, married and the mother of 2 children aged 8 and 13.  Both children go to school. Presently her working capital stands at US$ 900 and her business brings in a profit of US$ 85 per week. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

Umedullo has the qualities it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. Goal-oriented, hard-working and punctual, he is a natural business man.\r\n\r\nFunding from IMON International has been instrumental in helping Umedullo build his business. His first loan was for $600 and since that time he has benefited from one additional loan while establishing a great credit history.\r\n\r\nHe has now requested a loan of 6200 Somoni to add to his available working capital. The ability to purchase large quantities of inventory in bulk saves time and expense for merchants such as Umedullo. He would like to buy a supply of women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing that will boost his inventory before the busy summer season.\r\n\r\nUmedullo appreciates the availability of funding through IMON International.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Experienced and talented in the business, she has expanded her business into a successful trade, supporting her family of three children.\r\n\r\nThroughout the last year, IMON International has provided assistance to Mavdjuda\u2019s business through microfinance loans. Committed to growth and successful entrepreneurship, Mavdjuda has used her previous loan wisely and has repaid each with a perfect credit history. Currently, she is seeking a loan of 5,000 Somoni to replace her depleted inventory, hoping to continue expanding her business and support her family.    \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
