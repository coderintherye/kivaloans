She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Daisy is requesting a loan of 20,000 PHP.

He is dedicated with great care to the work that he does. His job is to work the land. He is a country person and he has been dedicated to farming cocoa for more than 15 years, which has turned him into an expert in this activity. At harvest time, he looks for support from laborers so they can help with digging up the fruits. His most profitable plant is the cocoa bean for which companies that forage those products pay him well for each kilogram. The problem with his work lies in not being able to combat the insects that damage the plants' fruits. The loan requested is to acquire more cocoa plants to then plant them and make good use of the fruit in less time. But now, what he has prioritized is to buy new land to expand his planting and expand his production. This will be his first loan with MFP.  He is willing to pay all of his repayments punctually since he wishes to take another loan in the future. In his community bank, he is a member who is very involved.

","en":"Aizada is 30 years old and married. She and her husband are raising three children, the youngest of whom is four years old. After having graduated from  college with a degree in philology, Aizada started working in the Zhan-Bulak village school, where she still works as an English teacher. In 2003, in the search of an additional source of income for her family, Aizada started raising farm animals. She had 15,000 KGS as her starting capital. At present her farm brings in about 15,000 KGS monthly from sale of milk products. Currently she has four dairy cows, 20 sheep, eight goats and four horses. In order to increase her cattle herd, Aizada turned to  \"Bai Tushum &Partners\" for a loan of 45,000 KGS to buy two young bulls. Aizada plans to use the resulting revenues to purchase additional animals, which will allow her to expand her farm.

She has a shop where she sells pupusas [stuffed tortillas], which she has managed to set up in her home. She has many customers since she is a charismatic woman, hard-working, dedicated, and responsible. Many people give her a good reference since over time and through her work she has earned the confidence of her neighbors. Despite her age, she does not get tired of working, especially since her pupusa shop is her main satisfaction. Her business is located in a very accessible, high traffic area. Gilda is very enterprising, especially since she is always thinking of ways to increase her business. Her dream is to be able to respond to an increase in demand, which is why she has decided to invest in her business. Her goal is to improve her sales and revenues, which will allow her to enjoy a better quality of life. For this reason she has decided to request this loan from INTEGRAL, especially since she currently lacks the necessary capital to cover the investment. She will invest the loan by purchasing ingredients such as corn, rice, cheese, chicharr\u00f3n [pork skins], tomatoes, and cabbage, etc., which are necessary for the production and sale of her delicious pupusas. Gilda is very grateful to the institution for the help she received from it last year to invest in her business. She expects to have favorable results again.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":32.3,"image":{"id":978840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase corn, rice, cheese, chicharr\u00f3n [pork skins], tomatoes, and cabbage, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-01-14T12:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":32.28},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":36.29},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":38.09},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":39.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40.86},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":48.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.28},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.86},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.3,"local_amount":32.3,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":32.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241329,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-16T18:38:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":379706,"name":"Rosalinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalinda is married with three children.

Then, later, when he was a little older he set up his small shop in his parents' house.  This business went very well for him because his father and brothers also helped him.  Later he married and started his own family.  He became independent and moved his shop to its current location.  Now he is growing more every day.

She has two sources of income: selling merchandise, an activity she does sporadically, and tailoring.  The latter activity is the one that allows her to earn higher income and predict higher sales.  Dora Isabel learned tailoring from her mother and sister. She has worked with this sister for some time tailoring for third parties.  She states that the best season is the beginning of the year as they assign her a greater number of uniforms to make and she takes advantage of this season.  She wants to offer better services to her customers, so she is looking for a loan to buy a flat sewing machine.  She hopes to increase her contracts and therefore, her income so that she can fulfill her dream of expanding her business and making her own line of clothing.  Dora Isabel aspires to leave her two children a tailoring workshop positioned to allow them to have economic stability.

They give priority to these products because they can harvest bananas every 15 days and sell them immediately, which gives them daily earnings.  Coffee is more profitable, but it is grown on an annual cycle, allowing them to save and then invest in their next harvest.  Her parents and brothers also work on the family farm.
