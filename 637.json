lives and works in Shahrituz, Tajikistan. He is married and the father of five children. His wife is a housewife. Turdi is engaged in cultivating crops such as water-melon, onion and corn. Turdi has been running his farming business for 30 years and he has a lot of experience in this business. His sons and daughter help him to plant seeds. Turdi would like a loan of 10,000 TJS to purchase seeds and mineral fertilizer to increase his working capital.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and marking the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She, together with her husband and children, manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMa. Joey operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively separated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper, and other materials. They sell these to junk shops like Ma. Joey's for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP. She will be incorporating the loan with her current revolving funds used to buy trash from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMa. Joey dreams of being able to give all her children a high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have a truck service for her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay back microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":818630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for scrap materials that she buys for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-07-23T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

It is especially crucial for women, who are vulnerable but eager and full of enthusiasm to start up their own independent businesses. \r\n\r\nKuku, 66, is the leader of this group. She is a widow and brought up three kids, the youngest of whom is a high school freshman. Her sons live independently in the capital, while Kuku together with her daughter stays in a small fishing town Balykchi, which attracts thousands of tourists both from Kyrgyzstan and abroad. The constant flow of tourists is a key to Kuku\u2019s business success. \r\n\r\nAs she is already retired, all she does is manage her orchard with plenty of fruits and vegetables. This year she was blessed with a very rich harvest of apricot and apples. They do not stay in a warehouse for long and get sold very easily. A monthly profit of 3,700 soms allowed her to purchase new furniture for the house and other necessary things. This year\u2019s savings plus the loan that Kuku is requesting from Kiva lenders will help her finance a trip to her sons in the capital of Bishkek and spend some time with them there. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\t\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n MBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

While Lugazi is not anywhere near the food basket districts of Uganda, many of the indigenous people there have recently embraced commercial farming though most of it is on a small scale. Many natives principally grow sugar cane. The two sugar cane factories in the district provide a market for most of these sugar cane farmers. Recently however many natives have taken to growing other cash crops such as bananas, cassava, maize, coffee and cabbage.\r\n\r\nLawrence, who is an affable father of 7 buoyant and high spirited children, says that notwithstanding the high cost of doing business in the country, he remains upbeat about the growth of his business. From the beginning, he found it formidable to obtain a footing in a business which was already highly competitive. Unwavering diligence, determination, perseverance and will power have been Lawrence's magic formula for his fledgling success. \r\n\r\nPrior to taking root in this enterprise, Lawrence was working in a small retail trade. The fact that foods such as bananas, maize and coffee sell highly in the food markets in this part of the country has profoundly emboldened Lawrence. Out of this business on a weekly basis, Lawrence is able to make sales profits to the tune of 400,000 Ugandan shillings. He reckons he will be able to make more than he currently makes if he can apply high grade manure in his farm to ensure good harvests. On the side, he also ekes out additional income from a milk sales business. Lawrence says he is requesting this Kiva loan to purchase high grade manure for his farm. Lawrence\u2019s group is taking its fourth loan from Pearl Microfinance now and their track record in repaying their loans has been commendable.

This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Rosario as she herself has been an undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nRosario operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 35,000. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Rosario dreams to be able to give her children a high quality education through all of her hard work. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

of Central Asian countries are mostly involved in several industries like textile, food production, medicine and teaching. A big portion is on behalf of trade. \r\n\r\nNurgul, 43, has experience in borrowing loans because she started a business breeding and selling cattle in 1999 thanks to a loan borrowed from a local bank. Soon Nurgul purchased a small pavilion where she could promote and sell food products. She said that twelve years of experience in this business have taught her many lessons. Every day work and patience in the past do not allow her to make mistakes in the present. She shares her knowledge with younger generations, and it helps them not to repeat Nurgul\u2019s mistakes. Her monthly income generated from selling food products comprises 39,000 soms. Nurgul plans to use these funds plus those acquired from Kiva lenders for investing in goods circulation and in a purchase of a house. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\t\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

There are a number of reasons, like fear of risk and lack of knowledge about managing a business. However, Orazkhan is not among those people. \r\n\r\nOrazkhan, 42, is the leader of this group. She knows that a good business should be profitable, both for her and society. Four years ago, while breeding and reselling cattle which brought only intermittent income, she decided to start another type of profitable business \u2013 a chicken farm. With an initial startup capital of 6,000 soms, Orazkhan purchased 60 productive chickens. After two months of keeping the poultry in warm and sanitized conditions, the hens reached a state of giving at least two eggs a day each. Besides distributing eggs to her neighbors at market price, Orazkhan usually has more left for her family\u2019s consumption. The business helps her provide her family with nutritious food like chicken and diversify the menu. Throughout these four years, Orazkhan has been making 6,000 - 7,000 soms income per month, which is quite enough to help her husband and their daughter. The loan requested by Orazkhan will be invested into development of the business and buying more chickens. \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young and ambitious socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 <i>People<\/i> (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), <i>Planet<\/i> (keeping environmentally friendly) and <i>Profit<\/i> (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

comes from the village of Nogha, West Georgia. She is 62 years old and lives with her mother-in-law in the village. \r\n\r\nPotola used to work as cashier, but at the moment, she is retired and is mainly busy with her agricultural business. Potola has four milk cows and two calves. She produces and sells 70 \u2013 80 kg of cheese at the local open market. Also, Potola grows 500 nut trees and sells approximately 400 kg of nuts per year. Along with the above-mentioned things, Potola has a couple of hens and turkeys. She sells eggs at the local market. The total monthly income of the family, including the pension of Potola\u2019s mother-in-law, is 300 Laris. \r\n\r\nPotola plans to increase the amount of hens and turkeys on her farm, but her problem is that the fence of the yard is already old and broken, and there is the risk that some of the hens and turkeys may go through it and get lost.

The fact that fish sells highly on the markets in Lugazi and the surrounding towns is also another merit. Her biggest challenge, however, is the tight competition manifest in this trade. In some seasons too, the fish stocks in the lake go scarce, meaning the fishermen will not make many a catch. This, needless to say, adversely affects her business.\r\n\r\nNusula says she makes sales profits totaling up to Ugandan shillings 30,000 on a weekly basis.

These middle class people are increasingly partial to goods sold in the supermarkets, despite the price difference. This has, however, not dampened the spirits of most retail business people, including Zulaika. Her 10 year old experience in this business is clear testimony to her hard work and determination. She, however, has never rested on her laurels. She strives day in, day out to make new plans for her business, including expansion plans. She says she still has a lot of leeway to make up to see all her plans come to fruition.\r\n\r\nMost of these retail businesses also operate on loans and the credit crunch in many respects adversely affected them. Zulaika, took this all in her stride. \r\nOn the side, she ekes out a supplementary income from a poultry sales business. On a weekly basis, she makes gross profits in the amount of Ugandan shillings 120,000. She says with this requested Kiva loan, she intends to purchase more retail commodities like sugar, salt, basins, toothpaste, beans, maize flour, rice, etc. to resell.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4250,"image":{"id":818938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more retail commodities like sugar, salt, basins, toothpaste, beans, maize flour, rice, etc to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Jinja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.583333 33.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-24T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zulaika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebecca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibra","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bairye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Halima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sirina","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hillary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petwa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":11000000,"loan_amount":4250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1833333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1833333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1833333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1833333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":708.33,"local_amount":1833334,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1834584,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227249018,"comment":null},{"amount":1416.67,"local_amount":3666665.99,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T09:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3669165.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868589,"comment":null},{"amount":708.33,"local_amount":1833334.01,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:26:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1834584.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648427,"comment":null},{"amount":578.25,"local_amount":1496649,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1497669.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313776,"comment":null},{"amount":838.42,"local_amount":2170017,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2171496.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275400,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-18T21:11:09Z","paid_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":319420,"name":"Fernando","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" \nNasceu no Distrito de Namaacha, provincia de Maputo, sul de Mocambique, casado e pai de 6 filhos dos quais n\u00e3o lembra as respectivas idades mas todos v\u00e3o a Escola.

She began Jefeisa, a wood-pallet recycling enterprise, 11 years ago in Monterrey, Mexico. Three years ago, Blanca decided to expand to El Paso by opening a distribution center where the goods created by Jefeisa in Mexico could be sold in the US. Blanca\u2019s business is a family endeavor, run by her, her husband and her son, Filipe.\r\n\r\nJefeisa Enterprises recycles wood pallets for use in commercial packaging and distribution. They purchase used wood pallets, like those shown in her picture, from stores like Sam\u2019s Club, take them apart and use this material to create new pallets for a client. Currently, all of the breaking down and reassembling of the wood pallets occurs in their Monterrey, Mexico plant, while the El Paso business functions as a distribution center to U.S. clients. Though the Monterrey plant employs about a dozen employees, Blanca and her family run the U.S. branch by themselves.\r\n\r\nBlanca says that Jefeisa\u2019s biggest challenge was attempting to break into the U.S. market with almost no knowledge of the American wood pallet business. Since she and her husband have limited knowledge of the English language, after they moved to El Paso, they relied on their son\u2019s schooling to translate complex and confusing documents for the business. However, by taking classes at a local community college, Blanca was able to learn about the U.S. business paperwork, create a business plan and successfully break into the U.S. wood pallet industry. Today, she is proud to say that overcoming these enormous obstacles has been the biggest success her El Paso branch has seen so far.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Blanca aims to open a processing plant in El Paso to meet the needs of her American clients and to provide employment to her El Paso community. In preparation for this, Blanca has purchased a large plot of land and a building in which the processing plant is to be located. However, since the building wasn\u2019t built to support the electrical needs of an industrial plant, the wiring and power infrastructure cannot, in its current form, be used to fit her needs.\r\n\r\nThis loan will help Blanca further her goal of opening a plant by updating the electricity on her newly purchased land. She says it will pay for the materials, labor and construction necessary to power the machinery needed to convert her building into a plant. Without it, this expansion would have happened at a much slower pace, as Blanca\u2019s family has not built the kind of credit necessary to obtain a business loan from a traditional bank in the U.S. \r\n\r\nWith the aid of this loan and the continued support of her family, Blanca will continue to supply her American clients with affordable wood pallets and will expand her business to offer employment opportunities to her El Paso community.

The group is located in the community of Concepci\u00f3n Chico.  The community is somewhat large but it\u2019s on a hill.  The main road is paved but during the rainy season sand starts to wash off and there is mud everywhere.  People in the group live near each other so are good neighbors and this is the reason they joined together and formed a credit group.  They called it \u201cLas Conchitas\u201d because they are women from the community of Concepci\u00f3n (whose lovable nickname is Concha).\n\nMar\u00eda is the group Treasurer and she relates the story behind her business.  She has a general store where she sells candy, soft-drinks, bread, milk, etc; everything related to groceries.  Her store is small but she also owns a nixtamal (dough made from corn used for tortillas, tamales, etc.) mill.  It\u2019s customary out in the communities for the women to make hand-made tortillas and not to buy them at a tortilla shop.  They need a mill that will grind the corn so that they can make tortillas and Mar\u00eda has that mill so that people can grind their corn.  She\u2019s been in business a little more than 8 years and the difficulty she faces is competition from other stores and from individuals who also own mills.  Aside from that, she also mentions that on occasion she\u2019s been paid with counterfeit bills and she doesn\u2019t notice and loses a lot of money.  She also has to pay to service and repair the mill.  She wants a new loan to pay to service the mill and to buy stock items for her store; she wants to sell new products.  Her goal is to improve day to day and to buy some shelving to arrange her store nicely and be able to sell more merchandise.  She hopes to have more profits because her fixed goal is to provide schooling for her children.\n\nMar\u00eda has three children in school and she wants to support them with their transportation costs.  She\u2019s lived with her husband in a common law relationship for the last 15 years.  She\u2019s 43 years old.  She lives with her family in her own house.  Her husband works too and this is why Mar\u00eda helps him out with what she earns in the store.\n\nThe other group members and their activities are:\n\n1.-Ana Luisa, has a nixtamal mill\n2.-Valentina, raises sheep to sell\n3.-Maria Eleuteria, has a nixtamal mill\n4.-Maria Modesta, has a general store\n5.-Rosa, has a stationery shop\n6.-Felipa, raises and sells horses\n7.-Maria Guadalupe, sells fresh fruit juice\n8.-Juana, sells vegetables\n9.-Nicolasa, raises and sells sheep.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3450,"image":{"id":819100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to service a nixtamal mill and to buy merchandise for a general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-16T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eleuteria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"loan_amount":3450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1293.75,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":15097.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201856,"comment":null},{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10064.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807448,"comment":null},{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10064.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618542,"comment":null},{"amount":431.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5032.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572787,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-17T04:40:17Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":319546,"name":"La Amistad Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El comit\u00e9 \u201cLa Amistad\u201d se form\u00f3 con la uni\u00f3n de varias vecinas de la ciudad de Mariano Roque Alonso.

She\u2019s been separated for several years now but had 8 children who are all now adults although two of them still live with her.\r\n\r\nTo earn a living and so that her children wouldn\u2019t lack anything she started selling clothes many years ago.  To do so, she set up a small stand at the San Jacinto beach facing the ocean where she sells all types of clothes but what she sells the most is light weight clothing that tourists who visit the place use.  She works Friday through Sunday from 8am until 6pm because those are the days when most tourists come.  She buys her merchandise every two weeks in Guayaquil.
