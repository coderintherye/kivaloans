These women hope to produce an average of three metric tons per hectare, making 69 metric tons in total.\r\n\r\nPart of harvest will be consumed and the rest will be stored and then sold for cash.\r\n\r\nThe generated profit will be used to reimburse the loan, to take care of certain family expenses and to buy trousseaus for their daughters.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":352028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To cover the cost of plowing, weeding, buying seeds, fertilizer and  weed-killer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kolondi\u00e8ba","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chiata Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chiata Sekou   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chiata Siaka ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali Bakary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chiata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":480000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":480000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":480000,"processed_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":482280.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991060,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-08T23:15:00Z","paid_date":"2010-03-18T08:49:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":121670,"name":"Khun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khun C., aged 39, is a builder who often travels long distances to find work at a building site.

These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Mukkaram is 42 years old. She is married and the loving mother of two children. She is a hard-working woman struggling to feed her children by selling the traditional fabrics for making traditional dresses. <P>\r\n\r\nMukkaram has a trading place in the central local market of Dushanbe, Tajikistan. She is trying to have wide range of goods so as to able to meet the requirements of her customers and to satisfy the needs of the customers with different levels of income. <P>\r\n\r\nMukkaram, being a devoted mother, is doing her very best in order for her children to be well-educated and happy. Today Mukkaram feels that with more working capital, her business could generate more income, so she is asking for a loan of 6000 Somoni to jump-start the business and raise the family's standard of living. Let's help this incredible mother give her children a brighter future.   <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

the past 4 years, Mavzuna has sold women\u2019s underclothes. She is the married mother of three children. She is determined to provide a better living for their entire family. Mavzuna is hard-working and kind, giving her the ideal blend of entrepreneurial determination and service. <P>\r\n\r\nSkilled in trade and abounding in character, Mavzuna has a strong business base. Currently, she is seeking a loan of 3000 Somoni to purchase a new vending facility and expand her business. With the increased income, Mavzuna plans to continue growing her business and to improve the financial situation of her family.  <P>   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Ulugbek is 33 years old, and married with three children. He is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the cultivation and sale of livestock at the local market. Every year, Ulugbek buys young heifers from farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. Now Ulugbek is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest in a loan of 4000 TJS for his business. In order to receive this amount, Ulugbek has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She has 2 sons whom she adores, and she lives in her own home, built from adobe.  Beginning in her youth, she helped her parents in their agricultural jobs, and since having her children, she has worked even harder, planting potatoes and peas.  Since six years ago, she has also had her own grocery store.  Her daily schedule is organized such that she spends her mornings attending to her store, and after 2 in the afternoon, she works with her crops, making sure that they grow uniformly and healthily.  Sonia is very happy with her crops, as she can already tell that her work to grow them has not been carried out in vain.  Her satisfaction is added to even more by the regular customers who she can count on at her grocery store.  Her two lines of work enable her to cover the costs of her children's education; one attends high school, and the other is in primary school, and for them Sonia works very hard in order to provide them with the best comforts and opportunities possible.  \r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP, and during her 7 previous cycles she demonstrated herself to be very punctual.  Although she sometimes is not able to attend her communal bank's meetings, she always makes sure in such instances to send the amount she owes with one of her partners at the bank.  The money that she asks for now is for the purchase of chemical fertilizer and various supplies for her grocery store. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":352156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Compra de fertilizantes y mercader\u00eda para su bodega","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-14T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2055.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734038,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-15T03:50:49Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":121743,"name":"Felipa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Felipa O. tiene la edad de 47 a\u00f1os, desde muy joven ayudaba a su mama a palmear tortillas pues era su fuente de subsistir, reside en el barrio 380 en la capital de Managua, casada y con un hijo de 20 a\u00f1os de edad que estudia, su esposo trabaja en servicio de seguridad, su negocio es la venta de tortilla lleva once a\u00f1os ofreciendo sus ricas tortilla que es el alimento principal de los Nicarag\u00fcenses, con este cr\u00e9dito quiere compra materiales de construcci\u00f3n para mejorar el techo de su cocina que esta en mal estado.

B. is 57 years old and lives with his wife and 18-year-old daughter in Ovorhangai province, one of Mongolia's central provinces. His daughter is a senior student in a local high school. Ayush started a small shoe-making business with his wife in the early 1990s. He decided to pursue a small private business after the Mongolian economy translated into a free market economy in the 1990s. Ayush makes warm traditional boots. Their customers are mostly herders who need warm and well-built shoes for harsh winters. Since they have been in the business almost twenty years, they receive shoe-orders from many herders from different parts of the country.

Ofelia has an obstetrician's practice two blocks from the Tupac Amaru Market, an important market in the city of Juliaca.

She has had her own practice for 2 years now, but she has more than 5 years old experience working at other obstetricians' practices.

Although they work hard, they still need more money to provide a better house for their family. Thus, Mrs. Rin S. decided to ask for a loan to buy zinc and timber to repair the house. This couple has three children who are attending the local school. \r\n<p>\r\nFour members in this group have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. Borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

Julia has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Julia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julia is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Julia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Z. is from the village of Purok 9B, Zone 3, Kiwalan Iligan City. She is 38 years old. Josephine is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Josephine owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling \"GTY\" products or Ready to Wear products in the local community. Josephine is just starting this business. She also has a sideline business; she peddles dried fish and longganisa to her established customers.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Josephine joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Josephine from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business and support the education of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

G. is 62 and she lives with her husband, Jose G., who is 70,  and their youngest child, who is a high school student. Their other 5 children now have their own families and their own lives to manage. Aside from having one child to send to school and focus on, Eufemia is also helping one of her sons in her business. Through a loan she received from ASHI last year, she bought a motorcycle and a sidecar for a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar attached)- for-hire business. \r\n\r\nTricycles are one of the major means of transportation for people living in villages all over the municipality. Tricycles can have a capacity of eight passengers and generate income in daily basis. This has been Eufemia's major source of income and her son's as well. The tricycle is rented by her son daily while Eufemia has her own income from being an a school canteen attendant. \r\n\r\nEufemia's husband is a farmer; he also helps her despite his old age. However, most often he doesn't have income because farming is seasonal. Eufemia's loan from ASHI is one of the biggest factors that keeps her business going and sustains the needs of her child in school. Without her tricycle-for-hire business Eufemia she would feel like she lost one of her legs. Therefore, she applied for a loan from ASHI intended for her business to operate. She needs to pay her tricycle's yearly tax, and renewal of the tricycle and driver licenses. \r\n\r\nWith success in this kind of business, Eufemia envisions having another tricycle with her next loan, in order to increase her income and to help other unemployed members of her family.

Though both Ma. Salvacion and her husband were earning, their income could not meet the increasing financial needs of their family. Therefore, Ma. Salvacion and her husband decided to request a loan from ASHI in order to start up their own business.\r\n\r\nIn Ma. Salvacion's house, a mini-electronic repair shop was set up and is managed by her husband, while she sells barbeque and entertains customers that come in. Eventually, her business grew and they were able to acquire many customers from all over the municipality. Ma.

V. is 50 years old and is married to Francisco V. Jr. The couple were blessed with four children. Their youngest child is still studying in high school,  but the eldest only finished elementary school while the second and third attended some high school. Letecia considered this a failure for herself but according to her she had no options then. She and her husband were just laborers and had a very small income. They didn't even have capital to start up a business. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Letecia heard about ASHI. Her dream of having a stable life with stable house and stable future of her children was rekindled, despite her chidlren's educational attainment. When she received her first and succeeding loans from ASHI, shestarted her own business of buying and selling vegetables. It has been two years that she has had this kind of business. Buying and selling vegetables has been a great help to Letecia and her family.  However, the demand of her family grows as years goes by, so  she aspires to have more business that can add  to her present income so she will have bigger profits and savings. \r\n\r\nLetecia thought of raising pigs (hog-fattening) in her backyard to be sold after four months. With this kind of business, she can still manage her previous business, because either her children or husband can feed the pigs at home when she's away selling her vegetables. Letecia's loan is intended for this. Someday, as her income increases, she wants her hog fattening business to grow. She plans to sell her pigs during market day in the town's public market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":352494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchases

They have four children--two are still studying while the other two are already working as apprentices near their hometown. Dionita still dreams that her two eldest children will pursue their education in college. She is proud that her children also sacrifice to help reach their goals.\r\n<p>\r\nDionita has always wanted to help her children but because she belongs to an indigent family their living conditions sometimes make this harder. She is glad that her husband is earning an income from driving a boundary basis motorcycle in their village. For 15 years, the business has served as their source of daily income. Dionita wants to help her husband meet their financial needs, especially for the maintenance of the motorcycle he uses in transporting passengers. She is requesting a loan of 6,000 PHP from Kiva. She hopes that Kiva will help them with their business to increase their income. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":352515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","use":"Motorcycle maintenance","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sta.

S. is from the village of Purok 9B Kiwalan, Iligan City. She is 26 years old. Janice is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Janice works in a family member's business venture in a specialized retail business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling \"GTY\" products or Ready to Wear clothing items in the local community. Janice is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Janice joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Janice is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Janice from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is from the village of Purok 9B Kiwalan, Iligan City. She is 47 years old. Gaudencia is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Gaudencia owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling barbecue or grilled chicken and pork meat in the local community. Gaudencia has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 1,000 Philippine pesos (about $21 US) a month for these activities.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2009, Gaudencia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gaudencia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 pesos which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Gaudencia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n<P>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<P>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<P>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

B. is from the village of Argayoso, Manticao Misamis Oriental. She is 33 years old. Jena is married and has 3 very young children. To make a living, Jena owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector: a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Jena has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jena joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jena is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Jena from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<P>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Th\u1ecb Ninh is a 52-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1. Ninh is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 013-Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng (18.01.013).\r\n\r\nNinh is married and has three adult-aged children. To making a living, Ninh owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of food products in the local community. Ninh has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 1,200,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ninh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ninh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business further. The loan will be the seventh loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. Ninh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\n<p> About the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  D. Th\u1ecb Phi\u00ean is a 64-year-old female who is requesting a 6,000,000 VND loan to support her business in the services sector operating a service-based business.\r\n\r\n2.  N.

C. is from the village of Tuod, Manticao Misamis Oriental. She is 45 years old. Estela is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Estela owns & operates a specialized retail business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling charcoal, rice, firewood and more in the local community. Estela has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 12,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Estela joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Estela has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Estela is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Estela from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Luftiniso is one of the most active and conscientious clients of our organization.  Luftiniso likes working with us very much, and she is satisfied with our lending terms.  Having repeatedly obtained loans, she was able to increase her goods turnover, expand goods assortment and make profits.  She is very grateful to Kiva for supporting micro businesses that operate in the same field as she does.  This time, Luftiniso wants to obtain a loan in order to add various types of pasta to her merchandise assortment, which consists of food products.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe requested sum is 4600 somoni.  We would like to note that Luftiniso Z.\u2019s first loan was for 300 somoni, and she was able to successfully use that sum and sums of loans obtained after that.  Now, having increased the loan sum step by step, she reached 4600 somoni.  Thus, using financing, Luftiniso was able to successfully move her business forward and, subsequently, increase her quality of life.

This helped her husband who is a tricycle driver (motorcycle with a sidecar attached to it.

L. is from the village of Tuod, Manticao Misamis Oriental. She is 49 years old. Edina is separated from her spouse and has three adult children. To make a living, Edina owns & operates a business making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling specialty food products in the local community. Edina has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Edina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Edina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Edina is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Edina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She is the leader of a four-member group loan offered by the Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women, a partner of Save the Children, which in turn is a Kiva field partner.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 004-Qu\u1ea3ng h\u01b0ng.\r\n\r\nThu\u1ef7 is married and has three school-age children.  To make a living, she owns and operates a business raising cattle for sale.  Thu\u1ef7 has been engaged in this business for over six years and earns approximately $87 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Thu\u1ef7 joined the Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation through engaging in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3.079.800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND, which will be used to purchase more baby livestock. This will be her seventh loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Thu\u1ef7 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  N. Th\u1ecb Ng\u00e2n is twenty-eight years old and is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector, raising livestock.\r\n\r\n2.  H. Th\u1ecb Minh is fifty-nine years old and is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector, raising livestock.\r\n\r\n3.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":352674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

She has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately $100 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn July 2009, Yolanda joined HSPFI, a Kiva field partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide her services. This will be Yolanda's first loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Uraljon is 23 years old, with his two small children and his wife he cares for. He is a very hardworking young man. He has land on which he grows wheat and onions and his wife sells their produce in the market.

Uraljon hopes that the prices of wheat will hold up, because he says that this will make his farming worth the sacrifice. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

the past eight years, Nasiba has been selling kid\u2019s clothing in the central market of Shahrituz. Nasiba is married and the mother of seven children. She is determined to make a better living for the entire family. Nasiba is hardworking and kind, giving her the ideal blend of entrepreneurial determination and service. Skilled in trade and abounding in character, Nasiba has both a strong customer base and a perfect credit history with IMON International. Currently, she is seeking a loan of 3400 Somoni to purchase a new vending facility and expand her business. With the increased income, Nasiba plans to continue growing her business and to improve the financial situation of her family.    \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He learned his trade from his father during his school years. Now he is passing on his experience to his own son, Jamshed. Together, they work in his studio, which is next to their house. However, the main income source for their household is from animal husbandry. Naim has 15 years of experience buying cows and sheep, fattening them up and selling them in the autumn, from which he makes a good income. His wife, Gavhar, together with their daughters Shoira and Shoista help Naim with feeding the cattle. The first time he took out a loan, he bought more cattle and operated on a much larger scale. Now he plans to take out another loan and to use it to feed the cattle. As in late September, he wishes to prepare for the celebration of the holy festival of Ramadan in which many families sacrifice cattle and give the meat to poor families and orphans. For this reason, Naim wishes to feed his cattle before the autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Josh Machleder, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":352756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"for cattle feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":122040,"name":"Kondi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce monsieur  est un homme mari\u00e9 qui habite avec sa femme et ses enfants le quartier de hedzranawo\u00e9 qui est un quartier p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique de la ville de lom\u00e9. l\u2019activit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de revenu qu\u2019il exerce pour subvenir aux charges de sa famille est la vente de cartes de recharge.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a hard-working entrepreneur from Shahrituz, Tajikistan. Together with her husband, she has two children. She runs a business where she sells men\u2019s shirts and clothing. Bakhtiniso started her business seven years ago and has run it with both extreme care and seriousness. Her daughters help Bakhtiniso with her business. It is an important source of income for her family of five considering that her husband does not earn enough money. \r\n\r\nBakhtiniso has requested a loan of 3000 Somoni so that she can purchase more clothing. Thanks to this loan, she will be able to grow her business further and help feed her family.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

All the members make a living in different activities. Some sell groceries and food out of their home, while others have posts selling clothing and cosmetics, are dressmakers or work in public transportation. Within their commercial environment there is a lot of competition, but thanks to the members' experience and their desire to keep working and make headway they have been able to earn the daily income that is the sustenance of their families. The loan they are requesting will be used to purchase materials, ingredients and tools that will help them generate more profits so they can proviD. their children with a better education and a higher quality of life. Despite being a new group, the members already have experience working with loans from institutions similar to Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital, which is providing them with economic support so

Julia has a stall at Pucallpa\u2019s massive Bellavista market where she sells chicken and different fruits, depending on the season. When I visited her recently in the late morning, she had already sold most of her chickens and had some peppers, plantains and oranges for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nJulia has been working with Manuela Ramos for two years and used her very first loan to fix up a house on her property so she could rent it out to tenants. At that time she had a business selling fruit juices but left that for her current enterprise at the Bellavista market, which she finds less strenuous. According to Julia, her loans from Manuela Ramos have helped her to maintain enough capital to keep her business going.\r\n<p>\r\nJulia plans to use this loan of 1500 soles to purchase 30 hens and to fix up her stand so that she can keep them there.  These hens are of a higher quality than the chickens she sells currently, so she hopes to be able to make a better profit with them.\r\n<p>\r\nJulia is a single mother of a five-year-old daughter. Her goal is to eventually have a business out of her home which would be easier for her daughter, who currently must rise every day before dawn to accompany her mother to the market. In this short video clip, Julia talks about the home-based business she would like to have eventually: a stationary and copy shop, which she thinks would do well due to the fact that there are many schools in her area.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":352411,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":844,"youtube_id":"jMm1qf0BF1c"},"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy 30 hens and fix up a market stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-07-19T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":377.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635442,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":377.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074518,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T01:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":377.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989857,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":377.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834801,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-20T02:49:04Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:39:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":122128,"name":"Marie-Claire","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Marie-Claire T. est n\u00e9e le 08 Ao\u00fbt 1972 \u00e0 Porto-Novo, la capitale de la R\u00e9publique du B\u00e9nin.
