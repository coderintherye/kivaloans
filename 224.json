It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Mr. Ork S., 38, has been recruited to be leader by the members. Ork S. currently works driving a trailer motor taxi (tuk tuk). Almost of his customers are local traders who work selling merchandise in the market.

He lives in a monogamous family with his wife and children in the Dialanicoro district of Bougouni City (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  After Koran school, he got started in commerce.  He has been marketing grains for four years at the grand marketplace of Bougouni.  This business wasn't successful, so he decided to begin selling condiments at the same marketplace.  With five years of experience, he has a good command of this business, which he learned from one of his sisters. \r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying his numerous customers, he decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso.  He is on his first individual loan and intends to buy a sizable quantity of condiments of different types.  Supplies are gotten in Bougouni and in Bamako (capital of Mali) from wholesalers.  And sales are made retail at the same marketplace, cash or credit accepted, to mostly women customers. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mr. Niar\u00e9 intends to realize a monthly profit of 26,500 francs CFA that will be used to expand his enterprise and to meet his family's needs.  He envisions opening a shop in the years to come. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":326659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy condiments ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":42976.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243055,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:05Z","rounded_local_amount":42976.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112665,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":42976.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873569,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-18T10:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":42976.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152101,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":42976.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021263,"comment":null},{"amount":91.65,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":42976.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778759,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T07:41:00Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":111829,"name":"Saima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saima D. is from the village of Danao.

Emilia knows agriculture. For most of her 48 years, this mother of four children from the Cimislia town has walked barefoot to her agricultural land, pausing only to hike up her skirt and wade through the brackish streams that criss-cross her path. When the spring rains come the streams swell, often washing out the bridge. Emilia will balance her lunch on her head, sing a soft song, and, with water up to her necklace, walk straight through it.\r\n\r\nShe's grown up with the soft mud of the paddy between her toes. Growing vegetables, it's safe to say, is in her blood. She remembers sitting in the fields as her grandmother worked, banging pots and shouting away the birds that treated the fields as a buffet table.\r\n<p>\r\nEmilia knew if she didn't get help she wouldn't have enough tomatoes to feed the eight people who live in her compound or enough to sell for extra money. But that wouldn't be enough to cover the cost of water and heating she spends for greenhouses.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Microinvest gave Emilia a loan to buy fertilizer, something she had never used on her harvest. She said she thought that wood and film was enough, but with a field full of gnawed tomatoes stalks, Emilia was desperate; the fertilizer couldn't have come at a better time.  Emilia should grow more than 22 tons of tomatoes to ensure enough harvest will be on the market for next year. In this way she will be able to return money back to

Therefore, the selling of used clothing has created a market for many Ghanaian women like Ruth.\r\n\r\nRuth wants to use the loan to buy more bales of used clothing and shoes to increase her inventory. She believes this loan will help her to save more for her children\u2019s education and also enable her to rent a store to trade in.\r\n\r\nRuth is member of the group called odo ye de (love is sweet).

Rosa will use her loan proceeds to purchase more cosmetics, and a glass showcase to display them.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Lucas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":326961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase cosmetics and a glass display case","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-02T18:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":152.37},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":158.26},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":161.58},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":169.2},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":176.19},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":182.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.39},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.22},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":152.37,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":161.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990652,"comment":null},{"amount":55.39,"local_amount":158.26,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":167.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211763,"comment":null},{"amount":56.55,"local_amount":161.58,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":171.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641289,"comment":null},{"amount":59.22,"local_amount":169.2,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":179.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080727,"comment":null},{"amount":61.67,"local_amount":176.19,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":186.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996868,"comment":null},{"amount":63.84,"local_amount":182.4,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":193.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842226,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-18T20:40:16Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":112040,"name":"Matilde","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Matilde has been married to Mr. Luciano Torres, with whom she has three children, for 28 years.

A., 39, is from the village of Migcanaway, Tangub City. She is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Erma owns and operates a business venture in the food sector running a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from fishing and selling of fish. Erma has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Erma joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erma is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP to purchase materials to fix her fishing net. This loan will be Erma\u2019s first loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business and to support her family's basic needs.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

P., 47, is married and has four school-aged children. She lives in the village of Danao. To make a living, Jesusa owns and operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Jesusa has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 13,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Jesusa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jesusa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Jesusa is now requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP to purchase a fishing boat. This will be Jesusa\u2019s fourth loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family\u2019s general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

After some years of such apprenticeship with her mother, she gained a lot of rich experience. She decided to go out on her own, selling clothing and shoes for 10 years now. She has a good reputation where she lives and in many other places around town. Women come constantly to buy her goods in her home. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the intention of adding to her working capital, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso. She has been working with us for 36 months.

Having dropped out of school in grade 11 (corresponding to <i>la seconde<\/i> in the French educational system), he decided to learn how to make local soap, so as to enter the working world.  He learned this work from a cousin, who had a great reputation in that domain.  This apprenticeship lasted two years and was the springboard for him to make really any kind of soap.  Improving on his own for five years, he enjoys public recognition beyond the city of S\u00e9gou.  He has available to him five well-tested apprentices at work.  \r\n\r\nTo make <i>koulikoro<\/i> soap, he needs a palm oil drum, 40 kg of caustic soda, a liter of perfume, plus <i>silikal\u00e9<\/i> for hardening the soap paste.  All of this is then heated in a drum for an hour and a half, thus producing soap ready for sale. \r\n\r\nConcerned about addressing the growing customer demand, he turned toward Soro Yiriwaso and is now on his first individual loan.  He intends to use it to buy two palm oil drums and ten sacks of caustic soda.  Supplies of ingredients are gotten locally in S\u00e9gou.  \r\n\r\nMr. O. sells at the retail level, cash or credit accepted from customers composed of men and women.  He plans to realize a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used as working capital and to cover family expenses.  His ambition is to open a factory for making soaps.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":327155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy raw materials for making local soaps","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamdy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":238.89,"local_amount":111111.12,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":113294.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243061,"comment":null},{"amount":119.43,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":56647.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678911,"comment":null},{"amount":119.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":56647.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112671,"comment":null},{"amount":119.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":56647.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028237,"comment":null},{"amount":119.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":56647.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873575,"comment":null},{"amount":119.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":56647.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763299,"comment":null},{"amount":119.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-19T09:11:15Z","rounded_local_amount":56647.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152105,"comment":null},{"amount":119.48,"local_amount":55555.52,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":56647.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991025,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-01T20:20:07Z","paid_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":112141,"name":"Richard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Richard M. is married and has 2 children.
