Maria\u2019s oldest children have already started their own families, but the youngest still live with the couple. Maria and her family live in the town of Chibuto, which is the government seat of Chibuto district, in Bairro 3. Maria\u2019s business is experiencing the same growth as when it started. She has already begun the process of bringing electric power into her residence. This is one of the positive changes occurring in her life. The loan that she received was of much help to her. She was able to increase the number of goats that she has bought.\r\n<p>\r\nSales went very well once the Christmas and New Years holidays began. She sold almost all of the goats that she bought. Maria M. travels two times a month to another district where she purchases goats from the breeders. She buys each goat for 250 MT and sells each for 600 or 700, depending on size. Thus, profit is approximately 350 MT per goat, not including transportation costs.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria\u2019s husband unfortunately is unemployed. She does odd jobs and works on the family farm to support her family. Maria is very satisfied with the loan that she received previously. She had requested a 3-month loan, and now would like to request another. She was able to repay the first loan on time, and without problems.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by Steve Fogel, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nMaria M. nao esta casada oficialmente, mas vive com um homem com quem tem 9 filhos. Os filhos mnais velhos de Maria ja constituiram suas prorpias familias. Mas os mais novos ainda vivem com o casal. Maria e sua famiia vivem na vila de Chibuto, Sede do  distrito com o mesmo nome no Bairro 3.O negocio de Maria esta a crescer comparativamente com os primeiros tempos. Ela ja iniciou o processo de montagem de uma instalacao electrica na sua residencia. Portanto esta e uma das mudancas positivas que estao acontecendo em sua vida.O emprestimo que ela recebeu ajudou-a muito. Ela conseguiu aumentar a quantidade de cabritos que tem comprado. A venda correu-lhe muito bem uma vez que concidiu com o periodo das festa do natal e do fim do ano. Portanto ela vendeu quase todos os cabritos que comprara. Maria M. viaja 2 vezes por mes para um outro distrito onde compra os cabritos aos criadores para a revenda. cada cabrito ela tem comprado por 250,00 Mt e ela revend-\/o por 600, 700 consoante o tamanho. Portanto o lucro e de aproximadamente 350 Mt por cabrito deduzindo-se o valor do transporte. O marido de Maria infelizmente nao esta empregado. Ela faz pequenos expedientes e trabalha na machamba familiar para o sustento de sua familia. Mqaria esta muito satisfeita com o emprestimo anterior recebido. Ela tinha pedido por 3 meses e agora ela quer pedir um novo . O primeiro ela consguiu fechar sem problemas nenhuns.

The work is hard but interesting and takes a lot of effort. Yasemen purchases calves, breeds them, and sells to the butcher who works at the local big market. At the same time, the salary is not enough to cover all of her family expenses. To increase the profit margin from the selling, Yasemen has to invest some money to make her small herd bigger. She applied for $500 to buy four calves.

They repaired and sold used cars in his father\u2019s business. <p>\r\n\r\nAfter working for over fifteen years alongside his father, Miguel parted and began his own business.  He has been independent from his father\u2019s business for three years now. His wife Fermina works in the business as well, helping to provide for their children. With a loan he and his wife would purchase more tools, keys, a hydraulic automobile jack, a hydraulic press, and other car parts.  Besides increasing the size of his shop and making their business even more successful, Miguel would like his children to someday reach the university level in their studies, something he did not get

She makes her trip to the market early in the morning to buy food to be resold later. Later in the day Murdani goes door to door doing sewing and alteration. Beside that, Murdani raises four hogs, two sows and two boars since in her village people rarely want to raise boars (to be used as breeders). In addition to the income from each piglet produced by the sows, Murdani also earns some money from breeding her boars to the neigbors' sows. She earns 50,000 IDR (~5.30 USD) for each breeding.  Hence her income from the boars depends on the demand. Feeding the boars is not much different than that of the sows, except for additional supplements and formula to increase the boars stamina. Her profit is used to pay for her child's education at the Udayana University in Denpasar (in 3rd semester). Murdani hopes to use the loan to fix the hog pen.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nSayu Putu Murdani seorang ibu rumah tangga yang tidak bisa tinggal diam. Dari pagi Murdani sudah kepasar membeli bahan-bahan makanan yang nantinya akan dijual kembali.Siang hari Murdani mulai  berkeliling sambil mencari jejahitan (canang) karena Murdani juga sebagai pengepul. Disamping itu Murdani juga memelihara babi sebanyak 4 ekor, 2 ekor induk babi dan 2 ekor pejantan karena di desanya masih jarang orang yang mau memelihara Babi jantan ( yang akan dipergunakan untuk pejantan ).Disamping pendapatan yang diperoleh dari anak yang dilahirkan oleh induk babi Murdani juga mendapatkan pemasukan dari pejantan yang  Murdani miliki karena setiap satu kali mengawini babi tetangga yang birahi Murdani mendapatkan pemasukan Rp 50.000 untuk satu ekor dan satu kali kawin.Jadi pendapatan yang diperoleh dari babi jantan tidak menentu karena tergantung dari orang \u2013orang yang membutuhkan jasa Pejantan.Untuk makanan yang diberikan untuk babi jantan tidak jauh berbeda hanya saja setiap kali babi jantan pulang dari disewakan harus diberi makan tambahan berupa jamu dan juga campuran telor ayam dan madu untuk menambah kekuatan Pejantan.\r\nDari keuntungan yang di peroleh dipakai untuk membiayai anaknya yang sedang kuliah di Denpasar di Universitas Udayana semester 3.

She took out small loans from the Fund to invest in a ch\u00e8 carrying stand. Ch\u00e8 is a Vietnamese favorite sweet dessert. After 10 years, now her both children are grown up and have careers of their own. She changes her work to bamboo weaving so she can work at home. She would like to apply for a loan of 325USD to purchase bamboo. \r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;\">Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><br \/>\r\n\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Mai Th\u1ecb Th\u00e0nh, 53 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 t\u1eeb n\u0103m 2001.

She always chose the loan that she could be able to repay. Besides using her income from the brick factory to repay the loan weekly, she also used it for family living spendings. For every farrow of pigs, she also got a decent amount of money. As time goes by, her family economy improves. Since the local economy also improves and many households invest in pot plants, she switches to this activity. So far, her greenhouse has more than 200 plants.
