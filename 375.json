They have an unrelenting work ethic and unfailing determination to succeed. For Beatriz, a mother of two, much of her determination stems from a desire to provide for her children. \u201cMy life has not been easy, but I would like it to be easier for them. I don\u2019t want them to have to work while they are in school, it is important that they are able to focus on their studies.\u201d  \r\n\r\nWhen the sisters first purchased the store from Susie six years ago, it was a party supply store with a generalized focus. However, they saw an opportunity to increase profits so Maiela and Beatriz made the timely decision to shift their focus to provide for more elegant events such as quincea\u00f1era parties, weddings, proms, and baptisms. They now spend many of their weekends with their four part-time employees, transforming event sites into glamourous spaces fit to hold that night\u2019s celebration. \u201cEvery day and every party is a challenge. We\u2019re excited to be doing this work, we love the adrenaline rush,\u201d says Maiela. \r\n\r\nA $4,000 loan will help the sisters increase their inventory, better manage the operating costs of the store, and launch a more extensive marketing campaign. Although the economic downturn has made running a business particularly challenging, the sisters are optimistic about the future and confident in their business decisions. They work at the store every day, often until nine at night, and will do whatever is necessary to make sure their business is a success. \r\n\r\nAs Maiela explains, \u201cIf you want to survive in this world, you have to be strong, you have to work hard.

Teotima chose to request a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby pigs to raise & sell in the future. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Teotima from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":512750,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase

She is 41 years old. Jocelyn is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJocelyn is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Jocelyn owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising pigs for fattening and sale. Jocelyn has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $157 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Jocelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jocelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Jocelyn is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which again will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 5th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from baking and selling bread in the local community. Delia has been engaged in this business for over 13 years and earns approximately 20,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Delia joined NWTF to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Delia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from NWTF. Delia is now requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional cooking ingredients. The loan will be her 19th loan from NWTF.  Delia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc., has answered the call of not just of a few but thousands of women.

C. is a 42-year-old woman living in the town of Brgy 9, Isabela, Negros Occidental.  She is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Anecita owns and operates a business venture in the sector of operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling animal feed and farm-related products in the local community. Anecita has been engaged in this business for over 14 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Anecita joined NWTF to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anecita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 19,000 PHP from NWTF. Anecita is now requesting a new loan of 19,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be her 17th loan taken out from NWTF. Anecita plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc., has answered the calls of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":511925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

P. is a 44-year-old woman living in the town of Prk 2 Brgy Nabali-an, Himamaylan City Negros Occidental. She is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Anita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling animal feed and farm-related products in the local community. Anita has been engaged in this business for over 9 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Anita joined NWTF to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from NWTF. Anita is now requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be the 20th loan taken out by the borrower from NWTF. Anita plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc., has answered the calls of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

She started her business in 1999 and has gained much experience over the years. Amantai's husband purchases livestock at wholesale prices in the countryside. Amantai and her husband slaughter the livestock and sell the meat to retailers for a profit. Their daily revenue exceeds 60,000 tugrugs (~$45 USD), and their business profit margin is 30%.

However, they cooperate with local restaurants, and they have a loyal customer base which brings in a lot of profit for them. \r\n<p>\r\nWith their business profits, they provide the money for their family's expenses and, besides that, they purchased a personal computer for their children's education with the XacBank installment.

D. R. is a 41-year old married woman who lives in Bagumbayan, Valladolid Negros Occidental. She earns a living by operating her general store, cafeteria and food vending businesses.\r\n\r\nAna\u2019s husband, Ireneo, is 41 years old and works at a buy and sell of scrap business.  They have 2 children ages between 7 to 12 years old who are currently going to school.  They also help their parents as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nAna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by starting the general store, cafeteria and food vending businesses. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 6,000.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of Php 20,000 was used to fund operations of her businesses, and had a positive impact on her family\u2019s living conditions.  Ana is a member in good standing. Now she is borrowing for her 13th cycle loan, the amount of Php 20,000, which she intends to use to support her businesses. Ana is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n----------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":511907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\nGemma is married. To make a living, Gemma owns & operates a \"Food Vending\" business. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from the income of her husband in farming. Gemma has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities. In 2008, Gemma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gemma has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Gemma is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Gemma from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They have 5 children between 10 \u2013 21 years old who are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nPerjolen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family.

Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 13,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nPerjolen is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 12,000 was used to fund operations of her vegetable vending and had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 22nd loan in the amount of Php 14,000, which she intends to use on her vegetable vending business. Perjolen is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family--to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

S. is a 58-year-old married woman who lives in Prk Mangga, Brgy Tabugon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living through her general store and livestock business. Hope\u2019s husband, Noe, is 59 years old and works as a farmer. They have 14 children aged between 19 \u2013 42 years old with some of them having their own family while others work to help their parents. \r\n\r\nHope joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in the general store and livestock businesses. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 12,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nHope is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 29,500 was used to fund operations of her general store and had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing, for her 18th loan, the amount of Php 29,500, which she intends to use on her general store and livestock businesses. Hope is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family--to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":509677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"additional working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Kabankalan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hope","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":29500,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1180},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1180}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":208,"local_amount":9440,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:45:11Z","rounded_local_amount":9475.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136722800,"comment":null},{"amount":104,"local_amount":4720,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4737.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144756077,"comment":null},{"amount":149.5,"local_amount":6785,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6810.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151938388,"comment":null},{"amount":119.6,"local_amount":5428,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5448.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159677293,"comment":null},{"amount":68.9,"local_amount":3127,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3138.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166890889,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-22T13:05:41Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:42:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":188239,"name":"Sara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sara O. is 36 years old.

Married to Cyprien KATADJO, Sourou Monique is mother to one child who is at school. The couple covers the family expenses together. Sourou Monique attended primary school only. In order to contribute towards family expenses, Sourou Monique began three years ago to sell food (rice accompanied by tomato sauce) from her home. At the same time, she sells peanut oil.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 'Dominga B.'s Group'.\r\n\r\nDominga is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Dominga owns & operates a furniture making business. The main source of income for the business comes from making & selling general household furniture for local businesses and community members. Dominga has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Dominga joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Dominga has successfully repaid a previous loan of 28,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. Dominga is requesting a new loan of 28,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings. This will be the ninth loan taken out by Dominga from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 50 years old. Minerva is the group leader of a 17-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMinerva is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Minerva owns & operates a business venture making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling candies, such as 'macapuno' and 'ube', to the local community. Minerva has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Minerva joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Minerva is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Minerva from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Raoufath is married to Latifou GBADAMASSI, a printer, and has three children, all of whom are at school. Raoufath lives alone with her children and provides for their various needs herself. She has never been to school. She has for almost seven years been running a business selling fabrics and beauty products on a door-to-door basis. She gets her supplies in Dantokpa, B\u00e9nin's international market, and in Lom\u00e9 in Togo. Raoufath has benefited in the past from two loans from ALID\u00e9 and repaid them correctly. Today, she is applying for a third loan with a view to increasing the level of her activity and to being able to respond better to her customers' demands.

Married to Bertin Gouedou, Delphine is responsibile for three children, all of whom are educated and live with the couple in the Agontinkon neighborhood of Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. Delphine moved to this neighborhood three years ago. The couple work together to take care of the family. In order to take care of her needs and to bring financial support to her husband, Delphine sells typical African-style cloth (such as Bazins, Hitarget) and suits through the distribution system.

Alice is asking for a second loan, in order to increase her activity and better respond to the demands from her clients. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Chloe Tuot, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":513159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchasing cloths ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.35 2.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-03-25T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:36Z","rounded_local_amount":15223.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653335,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":15223.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835542,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":15223.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575939,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":15223.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954453,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:17Z","rounded_local_amount":15223.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056111,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":15223.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347645,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":15223.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482708,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":15223.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617539,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-28T11:02:14Z","paid_date":"2011-02-05T09:06:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":188370,"name":"Luba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luba is widowed with two children.

She lives in the Baye Laye area, specifically in the Wakhinane neighborhood. She is a member of the institution U-IMCEC (bank of Baye Laye) since April 2008. She has already benefitted from two loans. She is a widow who is responsible for nine children  between the ages of 16 and 30 years old. Mrs D. is involved in the sale of breakfast foods in the morning. From time to time, she is also involved in the sale of female accessory items such as earrings and others. She has approximately 15 years of small business experience. Staying idle is not an option for her, which is the reason why she is interested in business which at least helps her address several economic problems. In consequence, she is asking for a 100,000 frs loan in order to purchase ni\u00e9b\u00e9 (black eyed peas, in america) and spaghetti to support her sales of breakfast foods. At the moment, her the most important financial activity is undertaken in the morning, during busy times, as well as school hours.

diversos pobladores de las zonas alejadas del distrito que no cuentan con este servicio b\u00e1sico. El agua la extrae de un pozo hecho por sus abuelos en la casa donde reside. Ella la vende a un precio c\u00f3modo y las personas siempre recurren a ella, e incluso cuando se corta el suministro de agua en el distrito sus  vecinos acuden a su domicilio a solicitar el agua que necesitan.\n\nPor otro lado tambi\u00e9n se gana la vida haciendo limpieza en algunas Instituciones de la zona, durante el dia divide su tiempo y visita a los locales e incluso casas que previamente han solicitado sus servicios. Estos dos ingresos son la \u00fanica fuente de ingreso con la que su familia se sostiene.\n\nFanny ya ha trabajado con el fondo Kiva y esta muy agradecida con los prestamistas que la apoyaron. Gracias a su ayuda ha podido avanzar en la construcci\u00f3n de su vivienda, debido al inicio de clases escolares a nivel nacional, actualmente se encuentra solicitando a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 700 nuevos soles que piensa utilizar en la compra de utiles escolares y uniformes para sus menores hijos. \n\n","en":"Fanny is 35 years old and a single mother who lives in her mother's home with her 4 children who are 13, 10, 8 and 6 years old.  They live in the Paijan district in Ascope in the La Libertad province of Peru, about 3 hours from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor the past 15 years, she has sold water to the people who live in areas far from her district where the population does not have this very basic service.  She extracts the water from a well which was dug by her grandparents at her mother's home.  She sells at a reasonable price and she has many repeat customers; also, when the water gets cut in her neighborhood, her neighbors come to her to get the water they need.\r\n\r\nShe also makes money doing cleaning work in various institutions in the area; during the day she divides her time visiting the businesses and homes of her customers.  These two forms of income are the only ways she can support her family.\r\n\r\nFanny has worked with Kiva before and is very grateful to the lenders who supported her.  Thanks to their help, she has been able to continue building her home.

Now he is seeking a $800 loan to invest in his business and buy more materials like leather and iron fittings.\r\n\r\nGildardo was a veterinarian and he began his work on farms where, in addition to helping the animals, he began to repair the farm tools and saddles; finally, he decided to specialize in saddles and leather work through classes he took at SENA.  Now he makes wallets, saddles and farm tools, creating his goods in the agricultural sector of Baranoa, Sabanalarga, and Barranquilla; in 2003, he moved to Baranoa, a region famous for its food and its Chicharron Festival.  In spite of his success, he feels like one thing he lacks is working capital to increase his production; he dreams of buying a sewing machine that will help him better finish his products since he

Ce r\u00e9seau qui, dit la pr\u00e9sidente, n\u2019a qu\u2019un seul et noble objectif : combattre la pauvret\u00e9 dans les m\u00e9nages. Actuellement, le r\u00e9seau compte 19 sous groupes avec chacun une pr\u00e9sidente et une tr\u00e9sori\u00e8re.\nParmi les sous groupes nous avons le sous groupe Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b01.

Elle est dans ce sous  groupe avec Madame Coumba S. qui vend de l\u2019arachide, savon  et du sucre, Madame Fatou D. vendeuse de ni\u00e9b\u00e9 (haricots locaux) et l\u00e9gumes au march\u00e9, Madame Aminata N., une commer\u00e7ante ambulante de t\u00e9l\u00e9phones portables et de Madame Khady M. qui a un petit restaurant \u00e0 Touba une ville situ\u00e9e \u00e0 170 Kms de Thi\u00e8s.    \n","en":"The \u201cFemmes Commer\u00e7antes\u201d Group (F.C.), as its name indicates, is a network of women who are active in the commercial sector. It is based in Grand Thi\u00e8s and was founded in 1992 by Ms. Maty N., the network\u2019s current president. She developed the idea following a training session she followed, organised by the OXFAM NGO in Thi\u00e8s. She is therefore quite knowledgeable about group management, entrepreneurship, etc.\r\n\r\nThe network members are extremely devoted and meet once a month. There are admission charges to become a group member, and afterwards each member must contribute 200 FCFA monthly towards a common solidarity fund.\r\n\r\nAs they wanted additional financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. This is why their network was split into 19 sub-groups of five persons each, to ensure better profit from the financing. For the second time they are requesting a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member, that is 500,000 FCFA per sub-group, to develop their various activities.\r\n\r\nReimbursements are made at the monthly meetings to the group president assisted by the group treasurer, Ms. Coumba S., who then reimburse U-IMCEC. In the words of its president, the network has only one objective: to fight against poverty in households. The network currently numbers 19 sub-groups, each with its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nAmong the sub-groups there is the \u201cFemmes Commer\u00e7antes n\u00b01\u201d sub-group, headed by the president Ms. Maty N., a very dynamic 55-year-old woman. Mother of eight children, this lady has retailed fabrics and various types of vegetables for the past twenty years. She is joined in this sub-group by Ms. Coumba S., who sells peanuts, soap and sugar; Ms. Fatou D. who sells ni\u00e9b\u00e9 (a local bean) and vegetables at the market; Ms. Aminata N., an itinerant vendor of mobile phones; and Ms. Khady M. who runs a small restaurant in Touba, a town located 170 kilometers from Thi\u00e8s.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":513336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Resupply merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-03-26T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759323,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790833,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971267,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708542,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922588,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189097,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T12:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484527,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620771,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-28T00:24:55Z","paid_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":188481,"name":"Hector Wilmer","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nHector es un padre de familia que tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su esposa y a sus dos hijos menores de edad en una casa brindada por su padre para habitarla, la cual queda ubicada en un  pueblo joven del distrito de Pimentel, ubicado a veinte minutos de la ciudad de Chiclayo, las condiciones de vida del cliente son precarias, su casa es de quincha con barro dividido por dentro con esteras, el piso es de tierra. \n\nSe dedica a la venta de pescado desde hace 10 a\u00f1os aproximadamente, compra su mercader\u00eda en el  terminal pesquero del vecino distrito de Santa Rosa y la vende de manera ambulatoria en Pimentel y en Chiclayo.

P. is 55 years old.  He lives in the Ciudad Modesto neighborhood in the southwestern part of Barranquilla.  He lives with his wife and their children who are between 21 and 30 years old.  Originally from the state of Sucre, he moved to Bosconia in the state of Cesar, but with few possibilities for work, he then moved to Barranquilla and opened a business initially selling toys, which he used to support himself, but he made good money during December.  So 10 years ago he decided to locate himself in various area of the city center, and sell basic goods such as oil, flour, sugar, rice and other items from a small cart.  Some items he purchases in bulk and repackages them to sell in portions of one pound or ounces.  He works in a very busy commercial zone in the center of Barranquilla.  \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan for $1.300.000 to purchase soap, sugar, rice, oil, and non-prescription medicines, which families usually have in their medicine cabinets.  Marcelino has been living off this business for 16 years.  When the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation arrived 10 years ago, he joined a group of 4 people.  He has taken out more than 10 loans as an individual, which have helped him to increase his earnings and to be able to move from selling from an old cart in the streets to a large wooden box with a metal door that locks and that he can park.  Since he has joined the Foundation, he has improved his home and been able to support his family.  His dream is to grow his business by adding merchandise, paying for it with cash.  This is precisely his great challenge, to pay off the obligations he has to suppliers who have provided him credit at a high price.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":513345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase goods like soap, sugar, rice, oil and medicine in larger quantities.

It is based in Grand Thi\u00e8s and was founded in 1992 by Ms. Maty Niakh, the network\u2019s current president. She developed the idea following a training session she followed, organised by the OXFAM NGO in Thi\u00e8s. She is therefore quite knowledgeable about group management, entrepreneurship, etc.\r\n\r\nThe network members are extremely devoted and meet once a month. There are admission charges to become a group member, and afterwards each member must contribute 200 FCFA monthly towards a common solidarity fund.\r\n\r\nAs they wanted additional financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. This is why their network was split into 19 sub-groups of five persons each, to ensure better profit from the financing. For the second time they are requesting a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member, that is 500,000 FCFA per sub-group, to develop their various activities.\r\n\r\nReimbursements are made at the monthly meetings to the group president assisted by the group treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck, who in turn reimburse U-IMCEC. In the words of its president, the network has only one objective: to fight against poverty in households.

Their main products are chicken and maxan leaves (used in the manufacture of certain dishes, like tamales).  \r\n\r\nThey do not sell from fixed locations but, rather, move from place to place.  For this reason they needed to ask for funding from the association in order to be able to continue with their sales.  Some need funding to start their business, such as chicken-raising.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how these people have been improving themselves and, with help from the association, have helped their business grow.  This helps their families have a better quality of life and they are able to meet household expenses.

","en":"As its name suggests, Femmes Commer\u00e7antes is a network of businesswomen,  It is based at Grand Thi\u00e8s and was created in 1992 by Mme Maty Niakh, its current president.  She got the idea of forming the network after.benefiting from belonging to ONG OXFAM at Thi\u00e8s, and was familiar with group organization and running a business.  The members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month.  Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a group operating fund.\r\n\r\nLooking for financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC.  The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people so that financing can be better handled.  Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various activities.  The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Mme Coumba Seck.  They, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC.  According to the president, the group has one praiseworthy objective -- to fight family poverty.\r\n\r\nSubgroup 3's president is Mme Kanane Rose N., 47 years old with three children. For 15 years she has been in the business of selling legumes and palm oil. Mme Khardiata O., 41 years old, is treasurer, and for 12 years has been selling legumes in the market at Grand Thi\u00e8s. The other members are Mme Sokhna Tour\u00e9 Ciss\u00e9, who sells dried fish in the market, Mme Fatou L., who sells palm oil and stew, and Mme Fatou N., who sells breakfast from her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Michael Briggs, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":513378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-03-26T13:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kanane Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khardiata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhna Tour\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759325,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790835,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971269,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708544,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922590,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189099,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T12:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484529,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63940.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620773,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-29T12:39:19Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":188492,"name":"Yenny Stand","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yenni V.

They live in the Las Nieves neighborhood, one of the most traditional and heavily populated areas in the southeast part of Barranquilla.  They live in her parent's home, where they also have their business.  On her side, in a heated glass display case, she sells food and fried food such as soups, cold cuts, sausages, pork rinds, and rennet on a weekly basis, and on a daily basis she sells sweets and fruits, including sweets made of chocolate, marshmallow, coconut, and fruits such as mango, corozo, pears, and papaya.  On the other side her husband works selling fish, shrimp and other seafood.  This is their second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n and they request an amount of 2,000,000 Colombian pesos that they want to invest in the purchase of a light vehicle to transport passengers.  Her husband will drive this vehicle, and they will also use it to offer their food products for sale, because Yenni wants to have a daily income that is more reliable.  This is a medium that is often used for transportation over short distances and to other nearby neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nShe learned to sell watching her mother from the time she was a child.  Now she has this same business, which was left to Yenni 7 years ago.  Her previous loan was used to restock her store and to pay off other debts that were charging a high rate of interest.

She started this business because she needed the extra income in order for her family to stay afloat, because her husband's income as a farmhand was not enough to cover the household expenses. \r\n\r\nHer shop enjoys a good business because the area where she lives is far from the closest market and her neighbors can't travel there every day to get the basic goods they need. Teresa tries to offer them high-quality products and good service so that her business will grow and develop well.\r\n\r\nTeresa would like to expand her store by buying more groceries, which would increase her sales and bring in more income. For this reason she is asking Edpyme Alternativa [the Kiva field partner] for a loan of 1200 Peruvian Soles to help her reach her goal.\r\n\r\nTeresa is a happy woman who very much enjoys her work. Her greatest desire is to give her children the opportunity to study towards an advanced degree that will offer them a better future. This is the second time that she has worked with the field partner and she has shown herself to be responsible and on time with her repayments.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":513399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of groceries to expand her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tres Puentes  B - Pitipo - Ferre\u00f1afe","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-25T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":82.74},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":85.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":89.46},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":92.36},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":94.41},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":97.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":105.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":108.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":110.9},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":115.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":118.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.3},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.29},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.68},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.44},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.32},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.3},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.81},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.3,"local_amount":82.74,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":83.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662360,"comment":null},{"amount":30.29,"local_amount":85.5,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":86.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695063,"comment":null},{"amount":31.68,"local_amount":89.46,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:31Z","rounded_local_amount":90.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878108,"comment":null},{"amount":32.71,"local_amount":92.36,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":93.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618135,"comment":null},{"amount":33.44,"local_amount":94.41,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":95.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832537,"comment":null},{"amount":34.55,"local_amount":97.56,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":98.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099143,"comment":null},{"amount":233.03,"local_amount":657.97,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":666.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554575,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-01T03:46:39Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":188498,"name":"Sulari","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sulari is a 41-year-old woman who is married with three children living in Dickwella in the southern part of Sri Lanka.
