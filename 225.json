After having worked in many kinds of businesses unsuccessfully, she got introduced to the restaurant business about 16 years ago.  She operates in Wayerma I Sikasso, there in front of her conjugal home each night.  She is in high demand by her customers for the quality of her meals. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso four years ago.  After eight solidarity loans (group loans) in a women\u2019s association in her district, she is now on her third individual loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.   She intends to use this loan to buy: 50 kg of beans, 50 kg of fresh fish, 30 chickens, 30 sacks of <i>atti\u00e8k\u00e8<\/i> (dried fermented cassava), 20 packets of spaghetti, 2 sacks of potatoes, 20 kg of green beans, a stock of bananas (Aloko), 5 packets of Maggi cubes, bags of mustard, and a sizable stock of condiments.  She buys her goods locally and sells her meals, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed of women, unmarried people, and young people crazy about music in her area who are generally night-owls.  \r\n\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 120,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment her working capital, to help with family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in her business.  Her ambition is to repay this loan ahead of time, just like the preceding loan.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":327169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To buy ingredients for the restaurant business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.34,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":86946.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243062,"comment":null},{"amount":91.68,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":43473.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678913,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":43473.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112672,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":43473.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028238,"comment":null},{"amount":91.65,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":43473.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873576,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-04T20:58:03Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":112151,"name":"Leonida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hardworking and industrious Leonida S. is 54 years-old and married, presently living at Clarin in Misamis Occidental province of the Philippines.

She lives with her husband and their children in Hamdallaye, a working-class district of Sikasso City (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  She has been running a business buying and selling condiments for over a decade.  She started off at a very young age at her mother\u2019s side.  \r\n\r\nWholesalers resupply the retailers at the marketplace who often have trouble stocking up easily.  To become a wholesaler, she decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso ten years ago now.  After several solidarity loans (group loans) in a women\u2019s association in Kadiolo Noumousso, she is now on her third individual loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.   She intends to use this loan to buy five boxes of Maggi, ten boxes of tomato paste, four sacks of dried onions, two sacks of pepper corns, two sacks of bay leaves, five boxes of mustard, and sizable stocks of other condiments at the grand marketplace of Sikasso.  She intends to sell her merchandise in bulk to fellow retailers, cash or credit accepted, at the new marketplace of M\u00e9dine, where she operates her business.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used to support herself, to help with family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in her business.  \r\n<br

passion and love of cooking, that is Mrs. Elizabeth L., 30 years old of Migcanaway, Tangub City. She is married and blessed with one child. She is presently engaged in an eatery business located at the city Food Court. Her husband is a casual government employee of Tangub City Hall. Mrs. L. is the one who cooks the foods and at the same time serves their loyal customers who are the City Hall employees, Teachers, Private employees and even students of the city. They also serve snacks and accept catering services. With the help of their parents, they were able to establish this business with an initial capital of only PHP5,000.00. As a coop member, she has already availed multiple cycle of loans. Now, she is applying for the amount of PHP12,000.00 under the Regular loan program to add to her capital in her existing eatery business. Her dream and aspiration in life is to give her child a better future. For the business, she is hoping that someday she can avail a car loan to be used in the business and for family occasions. She is also thankful to PAGLAUM MPC for the savings education she learned from us and for the Program and Services.

With the new profits from her expanded trade, Aba plans to both reinvest in her business and save in the Susu savings scheme."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":327255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy rice, oil, tomatoes and other ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Abura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.283333 -1.116667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":400,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T12:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":68.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63159050,"comment":null},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-24T09:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":68.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73584330,"comment":null},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-24T09:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":68.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87019525,"comment":null},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-24T09:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":68.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96932354,"comment":null},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-24T09:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":68.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103773490,"comment":null},{"amount":45.8,"local_amount":66.65,"processed_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":68.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110662543,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-01T23:35:55Z","paid_date":"2010-04-23T07:39:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":112225,"name":"Mujeres Activas Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The funds obtained by this group are invested in small businesses owned by each one of its members.

The following year, she was able to build an iron-roofed house for her family to expand from the thatch-roofed stone hut they had lived in for years. Since then, Larisa's business has grown even more, with a second plot of land and house for rent. Larisa is a self-sufficient farmer and businesswoman. She is able to provide food, clothing, and shelter for her family and education for her children.  This is a long way from where she was when she first received a loan from Microinvest.

R. and Narcisa O. A..\r\n\r\nThis is the Limonario Solidarity Group, composed of:\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1or Norman Alberto J., who is engaged in the sale of ready-to-eat food and drinks.  He sells these on foot in the Nindir\u00ed neighborhood.  He has lots of customers and is known for his work.  He is married and his wife prepares some of the products that he sells, such as tacos, enchiladas, roast chicken, natural beverages, etc.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Sara Mar\u00eda H. was elected by the Group as their Coordinator for this cycle.  She sells used clothing in the Oriental Market in Managua.  She sells various types of clothing, the best quality as well as lesser quality.  She has three adolescent children.  They are attending school near where they live and they help her by selling in the community and taking orders from some of her customers.  Her husband helps her with the household expenses but he works independently.  She needs the loan to buy two lots of first quality clothing for which she has orders and which she will offer during the Mother's Day festivities.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Narcisa O. A. is the last member of this group.  She makes and sells tortillas in her house in the afternoon, and in the morning she sells bread, coffee and milk in the town.  She has seven children: some are of school age, other youngsters are working in the tax-free area, and her adolescent children help her to sell out of her house and go to school nearby.  Her husband helps her with the expenses.  He is working in Costa Rica and sends her remittances in order to help her with the household expenses.  She dreams of growing her business so she can get ahead and be able to have the amenities that would allow her to work better in her kitchen.  She will use the loan to buy ingredients such as milk, coffee, sugar, meats, vegetables and two tables to accommodate her customers.\r\n\r\nThis group originated in the city of Nindir\u00ed.  They are responsible and semi-literate but they have a great desire to better themselves.  These people pay every Monday, which is the best day to make payments, after the weekend when their sales are the best.\r\n\r\nThey are working with ADIM because one of the other clients encouraged them to form a solidarity group.  And so Sara organized her group with two close friends and obtained a loan.  They are satisfied because they feel that the institution trusts in them and they expressed that they intend to be good with their payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She offers fruit during the season when they are the cheapest.  She buys them at the market then sells them at retail, which is when she can garner a better profit.  She is married and the mother of two young sons who work independently.  They are no longer in school, but completed their educations up to secondary school.\r\n\r\nEsther B., another member, also sells vegetables and peeled fruit that she markets to repeat customers.  She is known as a merchant throughout the community.  She buys her products in Masaya both at wholesale and at retail.  She has two young sons who study at the school closest to her house.  She wants them to finish their educations so they can have opportunities that she has never known.\r\n\r\nMaritza del Socorro is the coordinator of the group.  She is a young mother of two school-aged children.  She has a small stall in the Tipitapa market and works from early in the morning, returning home in the afternoon to care for her children and tend to the home.  She dreams of providing educations for her children and of making improvements to her house.

Since she was 13 years old, she has dedicated herself to tending to her small grocery store, where she offers packets of snacks, sweets, drinks, and other products to settle her expenses since she works alone.  She likes the attention because it allows her to make friends and converse with the people that arrive at her grocery store.  Since she is located close to a well-traveled highway, many drivers and passengers stop to have a drink to refresh themselves and a sandwich to satiate their hunger.  Mar\u00eda considers her business to be profitable because she always has good clientele.  She thinks in the near future she will have a bigger store with essential products and in this way satisfy the growing needs of her clients.  This is her fifth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA, and she is very punctual with her payments.  In addition, she likes the work in her community bank since her partners are her friends, and they work well together.

All five members own different businesses and they have many years of working in their community. They have been with Adim (Kiva Field Partner) for many years and have demonstrated to be very responsible individuals, always on time with their payments. They are committed to the organization.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ana Maria C. is a young woman. She sells food from her home, mostly pork dishes such as stews. The loan will be used to purchase pork to later make broths. She is mother of an adolescent son and she dreams of providing him with an education and to give him a better way oflife. She is so happy to have received help from this organization.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patricia del Carmen C. is a very young woman and a hard worker. She sells clothing to individuals in her community. She is mother of a little boy who she supports by herself. She is a single Mom and this fact has given her the drive to work harder and put her son ahead of everything. She is going to school in Comarca, and she hopes to attend high school in Masaya.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Mercedes Eugenia Rostran is another member. She sells vegetables door to door, as well as prepared fruits. She delivers to her more steady clients. She is well known in her community. She buys in Masaya in wholesale markets. She has three young children that are going to school near their home. She takes care of them and she wishes to see them complete their studies so that they will know things she will never know.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Candida Rosa Sanches is the coordinator of the gorup. She is very responsible and the group has placed her in charge because she knows how to read better than the other members and she knows how to sign her name. She has been working in the markets since she was very young together with her Mom, selling fruits and vegetable. She coupled her loan with her own savings and now she has her own stand where she sells oranges, lemons, tamarind, onions, garlic, etc. She buys her products in the markets and in the regions close to where she lives.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has three school-aged children, three adolescents and a little baby. They are attending school in the community and one goes to school in Masaya. She feels that one should move out of Comarca and study other courses there. Her work day starts at 3a.m. and ends at 2p.m.. On her way home from work she picks up groceries to make supper. She says that the loans have granted her the ability to purchase fruits in larger quantities and therefore increase her profit margin. She is alwaye encouraging her colleauges to be responsible so that they will continue to benefit from small loans for continued improvements.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leonor del Carmen Hernandez sells fruits and vegetables in the Oriental market. She has been running this business for many years. She dreams of making some improvements to her home. She has two school-aged children, and one of them helps her with the business.

Her work schedule starts in the very early mornings and to the late afternoons.\r\n\r\nMaria de los Reyes is the coodinator of the group. She was elected because she is very responsible with her payments. She also sells perishables, like her two other colleagues.  She has two small children who she supports. They go to class in the nearest neighbourhood school. Her husband helps out with the household expenses. She dreams of making improvements to her home especially because in the winter the house floods. With the loans she has received she has purchased vegetables wholesale, those that are imported from the northern parts of the country. The products are of great demand and that has helped her increase her sales.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

They are semi-literate, but they have great desires to improve.  These women shop every Monday; it is the best day to stock up, after the week end the sales are better.\r\n\r\nJosefa del Carmen P.

On the menu you will find dishes like the traditional rice and beans, tamales, meat, roasted chicken and pork, tajadas (fried plantain slices) with cheese, etc.  She works with Adim because one of the customers encouraged her to join a supportive group.  She formed her group with two close friends and got a loan.  Josefa\u2019s husband manufactures shoes in a small shop close to her place.  With this loan she plans to get ahead by continuing to increase her business that always needs extra capital. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Their coffee is very sought-after in this market because the aroma and taste are much richer.  This pleases the palates of their discriminating customers who are very loyal to Rosa\u2019s coffee.  She is very pleased with the higher sales, which each time are better.  She plans to keep going like this to be able to bring in greater quantities and with her own vehicle.  To do this, they know they need to work very hard and do their part.  The good thing is that the business brings good earnings.  Therefore, she wants to continue investing in it in order to give her children a good education.  The difficult part is that they have to constantly travel to bring the coffee, and that is very tiring.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She promises to be very punctual in making all of her payments.  With the loan she is asking for she will travel to bring in bigger quantities of coffee for distribution in the city of Lima.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":327463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-03T20:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990661,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211772,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641298,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080736,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996877,"comment":null},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:01Z","rounded_local_amount":174.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842235,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-05T16:41:57Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":112342,"name":"Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carmen ha pasado la mayor parte de su vida tratando de salir adelante, tiene 35 a\u00f1os y vive en su propia casa junto a sus dos hijos; Samuel de 9 y Maria de 7 a\u00f1os, quienes son el motivo de todos sus esfuerzos.

In the future, she hopes to have her own handicraft shop where she can provide better customer service. She knows that the road to her goals is arduous, but she is determined to walk it. This is Vicentina\u2019s first loan from MFP, and she feels responsible enough to make her payments on time. She is very involved in her microfinance institute, and she always helps the rest of her fellow group members. With the 500.00 PEN that she is requesting, she will purchase more wool so that she can produce more handicrafts and increase her inventory.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":327478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-03T23:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.1,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":175.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990668,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:07Z","rounded_local_amount":87.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211779,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":87.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641305,"comment":null},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":87.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080743,"comment":null},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":89.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996884,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-04T01:23:41Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":112349,"name":"Yessenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yessenia es una muchacha de 18 a\u00f1os, muy trabajadora y alegre, vive sola en la casa de sus familiares y tiene muchas ganas de sobresalir en la vida.

After finishing school she became an entrepreneur right away.  She sells men\u2019s, women\u2019s and children\u2019s socks and also some clothing made from cotton.  In addition to her, her mother is also busy with the business.  Zahro travels for products once a week.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

F. is from the village of Mansabay Bajo. She is 59 years old. Pablita is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Pablita owns & operates a business venture providing recycling services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from hauling scrap metal for local businesses and community members. Pablita has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Pablita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Pablita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Pablita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional scrap metal to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Pablita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

C. is from the village of Kapita. She is 45 years old. Celea is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Celea owns & operates a business making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling rice products in the local community. Celea has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Celea joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Celea has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & as working capital. Celea is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & as working capital. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Celea from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":327653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

","en":"Rahimahon Mallaeve is 51 years old. She makes her living raising and feeding cattle. Rahimahon would like to take out this loan in order to buy a calf for fattening and subsequent sale at a higher price.

Salim makes his living raising and selling cattle. The coming of spring for Salim means purchase of young calves, since in the spring calves and food for them are cheap. As the result fattening of calves will not cost too much.With the coming of winter Salim will sell some of the grown and fattened animals but he will not spend the profits to buy more animals. Instead he purchases feed for the animals remaining in his herd for the winter.

Her children, who range in age from 23 to 40, no longer live with her or support her financially. She started selling clothes in her area in order to generate some income. She will start her sixth loan cycle with Esperanza International. The other group members not only appointed her to be the group coordinator because she is the eldest, but also because she is an example of hard work and diligence.\r\n \r\n<P>Amancia will use her loan to purchase some new, fresh summer clothing to sell, including women's apparel, in anticipation of Mother's Day.

She lives in the house of an uncle who has supported her since she arrived in Juliaca from her native Arapa (Department of Puno). What she would like most is to forge a good future. Still young, she has started a business that is giving good results. She has a restaurant that is very popular for meals in her neighborhood. The seasonings that she puts on her food and the friendly service that she offers are her principal means of attracting customers.

(Pro Economic Development) group consists of 10 members, the majority of whom live in San Mart\u00edn, district of Los Olivos, Peru. The group is on its fourth loan cycle, and every one of the members is a mother who gets up very early to dedicate herself to her businesses (selling chicken, beauty products, among other items) and in the afternoon spends time with her children. Each member will use the loan to continue investing in her business. <p>\r\nThe founder of the group, Nelly Q. C.

With her hard work and sacrifice, Nelly wants to complete construction on her home so she can rent the rooms and make professionals out of all her children. <p>\r\nThe treasurer of the group, Flor R. S. (the woman in the blue sweater in the first row), is a young mother of two small children, ages 7 and 3, who wants to have her own home, since she currently lives with her in-laws. She goes out every morning to sell beauty products, lingerie, etc. <p>\r\nFinally, but no less important, is the group's secretary, Esmeralda F. P. (the woman in pink in the first row). She used to sell all kinds of items outdoors, but with a lot of effort she was able to get her own post selling chicken in the market. At first it was difficult because she didn't know how to carve the chicken, but now she loves her job. With the loan from Kiva partner EDAPROSPO she will continue investing in her business so that in the future she'll be able to buy a small plot of land and make professionals out of her three small children.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3025,"image":{"id":328005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Grow their businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-06-05T04:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricardina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9150,"loan_amount":3025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2287.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2287.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2287.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2287.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":756.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":756.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":756.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":756.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":2287.5,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2287.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52949922,"comment":null},{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":2287.5,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T12:51:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2287.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63166891,"comment":null},{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":2287.5,"processed_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2287.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73592252,"comment":null},{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":2287.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2287.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87027463,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T15:18:20Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T15:42:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":112624,"name":"Emilce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The client is 24 years old, single, and has been living in Coronel Oviedo for five years.
