The fruit of this relationship is their first son. Because of him they are happy living in their own house, which is located in downtown Chuvivana in the Pichari area. Jhon is a man who is full of dreams and the desire to get ahead for the wellbeing of his family. \r\n\r\nHe is a farmer, and at a very young age his parents taught him how to work in the field. Since then he has cultivated coffee with the hope of one day being about to produce in large quantities, but for this to happen he has decided to plant at least 4 hectares more. \r\n\r\nGenerally he gets ayni (mutual help from the neighbors) mostly for maintenance jobs, but during harvest times he always needs laborers to help him pick his products. Then he is in charge of processing them, drying them, and selling them. Although right now collectors have already picked up his products from his farmland, he doesn't have the difficulty of moving them into their area anymore. \r\n\r\nIn the future he wants to open a grocery store so that he can make more income. This will be his second credit with MFP, and because of this he promises to be punctual in his loan payments. Jhon is happy to have found trustworthy people in his communal bank. He will put the 2,500 nuevos soles towards the payment of the laborers who maintain his farmland.

She is 46 years old and a hard-working woman.  She lives in her own home together with her husband, 49-year-old Efra\u00edn, and their three beloved children who she would like to provide with a better future.  Blanca and her husband provide for their children.\r\n\r\nSince she was very young, Blanca worked on her parents' land.  Now she is really knowledgeable about agricultural work.  She is a farmer and has a plot of land where she grows cacao plants and other native rain-forest plants.  She has been working for 25 years and, at harvest time, she has the support of her children and laborers who help her to pick her fruit more quickly.  What she most enjoys about her work is harvesting her fruit as this is when she feels that the months of hard work are providing their reward, in the quality of her fruit.  She considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her products from the farm to the warehouse centers which are located in the town of Santa Rosa.  This is where they offer her the best price for her produce.  Right now, Blanca's main priority is caring for her cacao by weeding and fertilizing her crops so that she can enjoy better harvests.\r\n\r\nThis will be Blanca's eighth loan from MFP and she is happy to know that she will, once again, have financial support.  She pledges to continue making her repayments punctually through her community bank.  Blanca will use her 1,000 soles to buy manure with which to maintain her crops.  She will use the rest to hire laborers to weed her clearings."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":946072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy sacks of manure and to hire laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T11:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T13:44:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":370889,"name":"Juan Diego","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL Banco Comunal La Amistad se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas en la hermosa ciudad de Calceta, ciudad conocida con el nombre de \u201cCalceta la sin par\u201d por la belleza de sus mujeres y porque para sus habitantes no hay ciudad m\u00e1s hermosa en el mundo.\n\nEn este lugar conocimos a don Juan, tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 separado y de esta relaci\u00f3n que tuvo tiene un hijo de 11 a\u00f1os el mismo que  estudia en escuela.

The two men and ten women members of the 5 de Diciembre communal bank meet in Portoviejo every two weeks.  The members carry out a number of different business activities like general commerce, services, and others.

She is in a common-law-marriage and has three children; ages 11, 9, and 7.  The children all go to school.  Her husband is a bricklayer.  In addition to being a great housewife, she sells Avon products (perfume, creams, jewelry, and women\u2019s accessories) in order to earn something on her own.\r\n\r\nShe sells door to door, and she goes to work every day.  However, she only works in the mornings because it is much cooler then and her children are in school.  In the afternoons she has to help her little ones with their homework.  She leaves her products on credit, and she collects payments weekly.  She has been in this business for seven months, and the perfumes and creams sell the most.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy perfumes, creams, and jewelry.  Above all she will buy products that are on special promotion.  She will later sell them at the normal price, and she will be left with more income.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to get ahead and to give the best to her children.\r\n\r\nThe attached small photo is a member who could not be present when the group photo was taken.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2234.4,"image":{"id":946187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy perfumes, creams, and jewelry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T19:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercy Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yadira Tatiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jes\u00fas Piedad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana Andreina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nevi Agapita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Glenis Diopaquita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilio Leovigildo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marjorie Annabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"M\u00f3nica Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor Ariel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alexandra Yadira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Perfecta Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3575,"loan_amount":3575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":446.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":446.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1340.64,"local_amount":1340.64,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1340.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257183197,"comment":null},{"amount":893.76,"local_amount":893.76,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":893.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263318733,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-18T14:59:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":370926,"name":"Epenesa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Epenesa is 60 years old and is married with four children.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 11,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEden hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":216.67,"image":{"id":946329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T09:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eden","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":733.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2933,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2943.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738881,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2934,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2944.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146107,"comment":null},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3666,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3679.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275275,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T12:08:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":370958,"name":"Lili","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lili is 27 years of age and is married with 3 children.\r\n\r\nLili owns and operates a business venture, catching and selling ocean-caught fish.

She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.

She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business.\r\n\r\nShe expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElsa hopes her business will grow into a mini-grocery and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a loan of PHP 13,000, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMary Ann hopes that her business will grow in the coming years, and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work.

Her husband is Reynaldo, a driver, and they have three children. She, her husband, and their children, manage their own household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. The variety store is the place to go to buy one small container of shampoo, five PHP-worth of cooking oil, or a single egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling items individually. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRita hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams that, through all her hard work on her business, she will be able to give her children a high-quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week, where she can share stories of her work and also draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":160,"image":{"id":946510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":" to buy stock for her variety store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T21:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2354.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738886,"comment":null},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2355.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146112,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2132.96,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2354.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275284,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T22:43:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":371083,"name":"Jimmy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jimmy is a simple farmer with a simple dream in life--to have a happy family.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income to meet her everyday expenses. \r\n \r\nPaz operates a junk shop.  Trash is not formally sorted in the Philippines and, while waiting for local dump trucks to collect the garbage, people scavenge trash bags and garbage dumps for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic and paper, which they sell to junk shops like Paz\u2019s for a profit.  The junk shops then stack, clean and gather large quantities of these materials to sell to foundries, factories and others in need of these materials.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 22,000 PHP. She will augment her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors with the funds from the loan.  She expects an increase in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPaz hopes her business grows more in the coming years.

He used to work as a foreign language teacher at a local school and then, after retiring, started to work as a housekeeping administrator for the local village government.  In search of additional sources of income for his family, Alymbek started his own animal husbandry and farming business in 1994.  Thanks to his tenacity and persistence, today his business has ten heads of sheep and two heads of cattle.  Also, he works on 1.32 hectares of land, where he grows beans and potatoes.  Alymbek invested his business profits into repairs of his house.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, he requested a loan in the sum of 35,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase sheep.

He wants to use his loan money to purchase a small computer to speed up his transactions and to employ two people in his shop so that he can serve his customers faster. He also wishes to use the money to increase his working capital. \n\nAccess to financial services in Zambia is both scarce and expensive. Close to 10 million Zambians, 80% of the population, do not have bank accounts. As most Zambians live in rural areas, distance and transportation factors hinder access to available financial services. Mobile Transactions Zambia Limited (MTZL) is an early stage company that specializes in low-cost mobile money and other financial transaction services by propagating an open network using small businesses called Champion Agents. Bright is one of the champion Agents. This is his story. \n\nWhen Bright first started his business his main focus was to get people in his community to know about the service that he provides. He started off by doing direct sales to customers in his community by distributing flyers and explaining his business to them in person. His strategy paid off because barely a month later his transactions had increased from a mere 10 transactions a day to 48 transactions a day. Because of the quick growth of his business he faces the challenge of working float (electronic and cash value of his working capital) which means he does not have enough working capital to satisfy his customers from time to time. He frequently has to close his shop and make trips to the bank to convert his electronic money to cash and vice versa. \n\nBright is currently living with his grandmother who is taking care of five other people. He continues to work extra hard so that he can be able to move out of his grandmother's house and get his own place. In the next five years, Bright sees himself as a full blown businessman. He plans to open money transfer shops in two new locations. \n\nIn Bright's video, the interview is conducted by a representative of Mobile Transactions."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":945547,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2516,"youtube_id":"oqOX6ulgRn8"},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase a small computer to speed up his transactions and to employ two people in his shop so that he can be able to serve his customers faster","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Ndola","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bright","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":371197,"name":"Soake","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Soake est une femme \u00e2g\u00e9e de 47 ans.

Thanks to his tenacity and persistence, his business now has 30 heads of sheep and 6 heads of cattle, yielding about 9,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of dairy and meat products.

In search of income sources for his family, he started his own animal husbandry and farming business in 2002.  He grows potatoes, corn and wheat on three hectares of arable land, and also has three heads of cattle and five sheep.  Thanks to Sarybay's tenacity and persistence, his business yields from 5,000 to 25,000 som (KGS) per season today.  He also provides a taxi service during the off-season.  In order to further expand his business, Sarybay requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase wheat and potato seeds, treat land and purchase mineral fertilizers.  He plans to invest the profit from this loan into building a more comfortable and spacious barn and building a fence.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":946710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase seeds and fertilizers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyrgyz-Ata village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T23:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarybay","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T02:04:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":371220,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David lives in Khoni, West Georgia, with his family--which includes his wife, Keso, his 24-year-old son, and his daughter-in-law.

They are a group of optimistic women and men. This communal bank was formed one and one-half years ago, with nine members who are examples of intelligent people that are launching businesses that are transforming our environment.\r\n\r\nThe trust that is between them not only comes about through the time they have been a communal bank, but also because they are neighbors and live in the same area. \r\n\r\nThey would be happy to comment about each one of the members but they would lack the words. And so we will mention Rodolfo, a member who is 61 years old, who has a wife and three children. \r\n\r\nHe works in the transport service which has given him many economic benefits for more than ten years, and he is able to save money in order to pay household expenses and repairs for the car. With the money from this loan he will buy spare parts for restoring the car. \r\n\r\nThe communal bank Acuario is a group of caring and dedicated people who know how to face each passing day."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":992.16,"image":{"id":946876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Vitarte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.033333 -76.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2012-01-01T08:01:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodolfo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Proselita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yoni Noe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Raquel Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sergia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex Sixto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":2975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":495.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":496.08,"local_amount":1334,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1337.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257158728,"comment":null},{"amount":496.08,"local_amount":1334,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1337.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263288895,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-15T13:27:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":371342,"name":"Alejandro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandro tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, su actividad econ\u00f3mica es la venta de pl\u00e1tanos y este la realiza de forma ambulante, esta actividad la aprendi\u00f3 de forma emp\u00edrica, ya que por la necesidad que tenia de generar ingresos a su familia tuvo que emprenderla.

He has being doing this job for the last 10 years and considers carrying his sacks of produce the most difficult aspect of his work as they are very heavy and take a lot of energy. With the requested loan he will buy cocoa plants to increase the number he has on his land and so be able to increase production. This will be his 4th loan with MFP and thus hopes to receive your continued support with his work objectives. He likes being a part of his communal bank as he works with responsible people. With the 500 nuevos soles (PEN) he will buy cocoa plants to increase their number on his land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":946924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy cocoa plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-18T13:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-19T00:35:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":371361,"name":"Didier Adolfo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Didier a los 31 a\u00f1os de edad cuenta con una discapacidad f\u00edsica para caminar por lo cual para hacer esta actividad debe ser con la ayuda de un bast\u00f3n.
