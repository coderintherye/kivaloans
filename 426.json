While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Paterna owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) store business running a general store selling a variety of different products in the local community. Paterna has been engaged in her business for over 21 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Paterna joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Paterna has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Paterna is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Paterna from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\n<p>Felicidad is widowed. She owns and operates a sari-sari (general) store. Felicidad has been engaged in her business for over 24 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from it. In 2008, Felicidad joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Felicidad has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. She is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP (her portion of the group loan) which will be used to purchase additional inventory and increase her working capital. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Felicidad from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 29 years-old and married with one school-aged child. To make a living, Marites owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from the selling of dry goods in the local community. Marites has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Marites joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used for personal purposes. Marites is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to provide additional capital for her business. This loan will be the eight loan taken out by Marites from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The economic situation and total unemployment has pushed many people to seek employment in the Russian Federation but, however promising employment opportunities in other countries might be, this journey in search of a job is an extremely risky undertaking and requires one to be very brave and careful. \r\n\r\nYrysbu U. is the leader of this group. She has raised four children. Her eldest daughter is 35. When she realized that her own country had little to offer in her youth, she decided to try her chances in Russia. Now she is working in Russia as a saleswoman. Yrysbu\u2019s middle son, who is 30, also made up his mind to work in Russia. He is working in a clothing factory. Her second son, 27, works as a security guard in the biggest Kyrgyzstan market. Her younger daughter got married and now she is a housewife. As for Yrysbu\u2019s husband, he is an actor. He works in the Naryn theater. Yrysbu raises cattle. Her son and daughter help her look after the cattle, so this activity does not present significant difficulties for Yrysbu. Eight years ago, Yrysbu bought a cow and since then has been striving to increase her cattle population. Yrysbu needs a loan to purchase sheep. She plans to save her earnings to help her grandchildren in the future. Her dream is to buy each grandchild a flat and a car. \r\n\r\n<u>Yrysbu\u2019s partners:<\/u>\r\nGulnara A., 45, is the mother of three sons. Gulnara combines two jobs. Apart from a regular job, she also breeds cattle. Gulnara hopes to obtain this loan and buy three sheep.\r\n\r\nJidekul T., 62, is retired. She keeps cows and sells milk. Jidekul needs this loan to buy one more cow to increase her income. \r\n\r\nJypargul O., 33, has a son. She works in a small factory producing sausages. Jypargul hopes to obtain this loan to buy a calf, feed it and sell it. She will use the money earned to prepare her children for school. \r\n\r\nAimkan A., 37, has two children. She works as an accountant and also raises cattle. Aimkan sells milk and thus has an extra source of income. Aimkan has applied for this loan to buy a calf for feeding. \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept \u2013 <b>P<\/b>eople (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), <b>P<\/b>rofit (to be profitable to grow further) and the <b>P<\/b>lanet (taking care of the environment).

For instance, a high rate of unemployment makes people find and create jobs for themselves. Thus, there emerges a certain class of people who are not affected by the economic conditions in their country as they have their own households and can survive with their own cattle and land. The people in our story are such people, who have preferred to create their own happiness without the government\u2019s assistance. They would rather be independent entrepreneurs than always follow the changes in economic conditions and feel unsafe. \r\n\r\nAishahon I. is the leader of this group. She is 55 and has two children. Both of her sons are private builders. As for her husband, he and Aishahon are farmers and raise cattle. Sixteen years ago, they obtained land from the government and started farming. They started growing wheat and cotton. With great effort and tireless work, they have been able to achieve a decent income. They have been able to repair their house and marry off their son. At the moment, Aishahon needs a loan to purchase mineral fertilizers for cotton. She hopes to have a good harvest and, after selling the crops, to buy new furniture for her home. \r\n\r\n<u>Aishahon\u2019s partners:<\/u>\r\nIlgorbek A., 27, is married and has a son. He and his father own a pasture where they raise cattle. With their income, Ilgorbek has managed to obtain a college education, find a job and get married. Now Ilgorbek needs a loan to buy a washing machine as a present for his wife. \r\n\r\nYokutoi I., 27, is married and has two children. She used to manufacture clothes and sell them in the market. Later her husband organized a small shop within the house and now she sells foodstuffs. Yokutoi needs a loan to purchase foodstuffs to increase her turnover. \r\n\r\nHursanai A., 33, is the mother of two children. Her husband is a cattle breeder. As for Hursanai, she looks after cattle and sells milk. With the cattle breeding, Hursanai\u2019s family has built a new house. Hursanai needs a loan to purchase a cow. \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept \u2013 <b>P<\/b>eople (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), <b>P<\/b>rofit (to be profitable to grow further) and the <b>P<\/b>lanet (taking care of the environment).

Now, people in Kirgizstan are in an avid search for a haven, where they could lead a quality life while working their dream job. \r\n\r\nAilarhon B. is the leader of this group. She\u2019s forty-five years old and she begins her day at sunrise milking the cows. It is worthy to note, that her day job is teaching English at a local school. But fifteen years ago, together with her husband, she bought some livestock and began to breed cattle -- raising and milking it. Today her flock includes three heifers and three milking cows. This business brings in about five thousand soms a month, which is a very decent income in the countryside. \r\nAilarahon has four children. Her oldest daughter is studying at a university, her middle one just got married, and her youngest daughter helps her mother around the house and with the business. Her youngest child \u2013 her son \u2013 works construction. \r\nAilrahon is asking for a loan, because she plans to expand her business and buy another cow. In the near future she needs enough resources to fix up her house, buy new furniture and marry off her daughters. She understands that this will involve dedication and constant work. \r\n\r\nShe has three partners in the group:\r\n\r\nGairatbek P. is thirty-five years old, and the last ten of them he has fattened and sold livestock. He buys a bull, fattens it for about three months, and then resells it at the livestock market. He has three growing children, and so he needs to increase his income if he wants to meet the growing needs of his family. With the loan, he would buy a heifer to raise more cattle. \r\n\r\nTillyahan S. is forty-three years old and a mother of three children. Her main objective in life is to raise her children and help them get a good start in life. She\u2019s retired right now and raises livestock and corn for a living.

Moreover. her husband is an asthmatic patient which makes it difficult at times for him to support the family. She recently lost her son who had been quite  helpful to her.

Her inability to acquire investment capital, which could generate income for her to meet her family needs is what motivated her to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\r\n.\r\nGiven a loan, she plans to buy groundnut, cocoyam, beans, cassava, plantain and corn from far off villages to resell at retail in the city.

Las actividades que desempe\u00f1a son bastante rentables porque le permiten vivir c\u00f3modamente, por eso para m\u00e1s adelante tiene planeado instalar un negocio de venta de verduras, que estar\u00e1 ubicado en un puesto del mercado mayorista de la ciudad.Esla segunda vez que tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP,  y le gusta mucho trabajar con su grupo comunal, porque  esta integrado por personas emprendedoras y responsables.Carmen tiene planeado invertir el dinero solicitado en la compra de  varios sacos de abono, que esparcir\u00e1 sobre sus cultivos de alverja, para mejorar la calidad de sus cultivos y generarse mejores ganancias.","en":"Carmen, 40, is a widow and has managed to support her 4 children on her own.  Now she lives with only two of them in her own house.  The oldest children now work and are independent.  For 2 years Carmen has been working to cultivate potatoes, peas and beans.  While she works in agriculture in the mornings, in the afternoons she also has a business selling food (agua de manzana (an apple drink), maca (an Andean root vegetable), soy, and also bread filled with cheese, chicken and pork) in a plaza in her city where she has a kiosk.  And if that weren't enough, she also sells a variety of snacks in a cafe in a school in her area.  She says that it is best to attend to her customers graciously, because as a result of the good treatment they always return.  In addition, her best assistant is her youngest son, who is in charge of delivering orders and cleaning the utensils.  The activities that she performs are sufficiently profitable, because they allow her to live comfortably.  For this reason in the future she has plans to set up a business selling vegetables that will be located in a stall in the wholesale market in her city.  This is the second time that she has taken a loan with MFP, and she enjoys working with her communal group very much because it is made up of people who are hardworking and responsible.  Carmen plans to invest the money requested in the purchase of a number of bags of organic fertilizer, that she will scatter over her cultivations of peas to improve the quality of her crops and generate better earnings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":566439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy organic fertilizer to improve the quality of her crops ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-12T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1059,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724881,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-12T19:52:34Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":213823,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lucy es comerciante de libros, tiene un puesto en la zona centra la de ciudad de La Paz, es madre soltera de dos hijos de 16 y 9 a\u00f1os de edad mismos que depende de ella; tiene su casa propia ubicada en la zona Mariscal Sucre de la ciudad de El Alto.\n \nEl cr\u00e9dito lo destinar\u00e1 para la compra de mercader\u00eda (libros) para poder participar en una feria de libros que se llevar\u00e1 a cabo dentro de dos semanas en la ciudad de El Alto..\n \nEs el primer cr\u00e9dito con IMPRO, la evaluaci\u00f3n realizada califica para la aprobaci\u00f3n del prestamos solicitado por Lucy. \n","en":"Lucy sells books; she has a stall in the central area of the city of La Paz.

She lives in her mother's house together with her husband Atis (33). They have 3 small children. Jenny works planting potatoes, maize, peas and gladioli flowers, which are some of the best in the zone thanks to painstaking dedication she gives to them. What Jenny likes most about her work is planting the gladioli seeds and enjoying their exquisite smell. Nevertheless, she gets annoyed sometimes because her plots are so far away from her house. On top of her agricultural work she also raises 16 cows, which she has at the top of the village where she lives. Jenny's husband works as a driller in a mine in the south of Peru and comes home every 20 days. In the future Jenny is planning to continue to plant seeds, and for this wants to purchase more plots of productive land in her area. She also wants to build a house in the central city zone to install a food-sale business.

Nevertheless, he doesn't like not having anyone to help him and so he is thinking about renting his land out to his brother. Marcelo also wants to purchase a quantity of small animals, such as guinea pigs, chickens and rabbits, and to install a barn. This is the tenth time he has had a loan from MFP, and as he is part of the board of directors he feels happy to continue working with the members of his communal bank as they are very responsible people. Marcelo plans to invest this loan in the purchase of sacks of fertiliser to scatter on his crops as he wants them to be of a better quality, and in this way continue with his business.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":566503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase fertiliser to improve crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-13T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:09Z","rounded_local_amount":564.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449689,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-13T12:58:43Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":213842,"name":"Basilio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Basilio tiene 38 a\u00f1os, vive con su pareja y su hija en una casa alquilada.

Three years ago, with his father's help, he opened his own internet caf\u00e9.  \r\n\r\nAlbin is requesting a loan for 500,000 colones (Costa Rica's currency) to buy a multi functional printer that will allow him to expand his business and to meet the needs of the people in his community that have called his attention to the lack of this service. \r\n\r\nAlbin is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal de Bancruce, one of the 100 EDESA member organizations in Costa Rica.  This will be his first loan and he is sure that it will be very beneficial for his business.

Now all those things are changing.\r\n \r\nAna is excited to be taking her ninth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business to buy rice, flour and other foods. Her business is a Colmado, a place where you can find all the ingredients to make your daily food. Normally those colmados are in the same neighborhood, a short walking distance from any home. She will use the profits to buy school supplies. In the future, she needs to buy a stove and building site. Her dream is that the Lord gives her strength to work and help her family. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate\u2019s story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally.

She is a very hard-working woman that for the past several years has been selling fast food such as, hamburgers and salchipapas (a dish made with fried sausage and French fries served with salsa).  At 5:00 in the afternoon she puts a sign outside her house advertising these delicious dishes.  She prepares them and sells them herself on disposable plates to her regular customers who come to her because of her tasty food and good prices.  Her business is growing and she is happy to be able to give her children (who also help her in the business) a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, she hopes to continue improving her business as she likes it a lot and it offers her the convenience of working from home.  This is her seventeenth loan with MFP and she has always been very responsible with her payments.  Cristina plans to buy the various ingredients that she needs for the preparation of her dishes with the money requested and in this manner, she hopes to continue growing her business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ann Achilli, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":566578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy ingredients for the preparation of her fast food dishes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-13T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":74.73},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":77.44},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":81.05},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":85.22},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":88.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":92.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.98},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.42},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.89,"local_amount":74.73,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":84.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673561,"comment":null},{"amount":30.98,"local_amount":77.44,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":87.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887380,"comment":null},{"amount":32.42,"local_amount":81.05,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154391,"comment":null},{"amount":69.6,"local_amount":174,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":196.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588395,"comment":null},{"amount":37.11,"local_amount":92.78,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":104.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724886,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-14T22:36:34Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":213878,"name":"Mutua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mutua N. is 45 years old and married with three children.

With this loan she wants to buy more costume jewelry such as necklaces, chains and tinned goods for her business.\r\n\r\nIn the future Luz wants to move her business to the gold sector because of the delinquency that exists. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":566573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase necklaces, rings and canned goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-07-15T06:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Felicidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":65.07},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":76.61},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":78.76},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":80.21},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":82.07},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":84.57},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":98.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.07},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.61},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.76},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.21},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.07},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.57},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.07,"local_amount":65.07,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":65.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845917,"comment":null},{"amount":72.93,"local_amount":72.93,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":72.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172112191,"comment":null},{"amount":75.58,"local_amount":75.58,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":75.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405599,"comment":null},{"amount":76.61,"local_amount":76.61,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:05:35Z","rounded_local_amount":76.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182544070,"comment":null},{"amount":78.76,"local_amount":78.76,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":78.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680824,"comment":null},{"amount":80.21,"local_amount":80.21,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":80.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379159,"comment":null},{"amount":82.07,"local_amount":82.07,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-23T08:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":82.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797149,"comment":null},{"amount":84.57,"local_amount":84.57,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":84.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201239323,"comment":null},{"amount":85.93,"local_amount":85.93,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-16T08:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":85.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206105773,"comment":null},{"amount":98.27,"local_amount":98.27,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-20T07:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":98.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211862544,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-18T21:24:34Z","paid_date":"2011-06-20T07:51:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":213880,"name":"La Union #

Her two older children work and help economically while her husband can't find steady work, but does so when he is hired as a master bricklayer. Their joint efforts have allowed them to build their own home. Maria takes care of the daily household chores as well as raising chickens, guinea pigs, pigs and cattle which she sells when the need arises. \r\n\r\nShe has been our partner through two cycles and is very happy with her friends in the group. Her new loan will be invested in the purchase of fertilizer for the grazing field so she can feed her cattle properly since her goal is to keep growing the business. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Solson Scherman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":566586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase Fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-07-13T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Lastenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632991,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166847025,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113481,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407131,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407132,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388214,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388215,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682772,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-13T22:20:24Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":213885,"name":"Omar Abel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el sr.

She has worked in agriculture for more than 21 years, mainly cultivating colored corn.  During the harvest season her husband and children help her with the work, and at times she also hires neighbors, so that they can help her carefully choose each ear of corn to dry in the sun, and later pack. Once this process is finished the corn is transported to the capital city for sale.  Her products are highly sought-after, since the quality of her harvest is good, and this motivates her to continue with the business.  Also, she receives good profits that help her to cover the household expenses.

Her eldest son is about to get married and the other two live outside the country but help out economically. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that she will invest her new loan in the purchase of more chickens to grow the business towards a goal of having a larger poultry farm. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Solson Scherman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":566592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-07-13T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632992,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166847026,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113482,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407133,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:38Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407134,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388216,"comment":null},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388217,"comment":null},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682773,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-14T00:34:31Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":213888,"name":"Nelson Yovany","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el se\u00f1or Nelson Yovany C.

B. is from the village of Galas, Dipolog City. She is 40 years old, married, and has two school-aged children and one infant-aged child. To make a living, she sells fruits and vegetables in the local community. She is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lorena joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lorena is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 3rd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":562278,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,950 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. Edilberta is requesting a new loan of 14,950 PHP which will be used to purchase a home appliance. This will be her 7th loan from PMPC. \r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

T. is 36 years old. She is married and has 5 children (ages 1 month - 17 years). She owns a business selling ice cakes, which are flavored ice in styrofoam cups.  Annie has 1 year of experience in this business.  \r\n\r\nAnnie needs a loan of WST 1000 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and cordial flavoring. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 90 talas or US $38 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Annie joined SPBD. This is her 1st loan from SPBD. SPBD's loans are Annie's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for loans from traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

T. is 21 years old.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 talas or US $42 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Iva joined SPBD. This is her 1st loan from SPBD. SPBD's loans are Iva's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan from traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

L. is 40 years old. She is married and has a 1-year-old child.  She owns a business planting, harvesting and selling taamu, a root vegetable much like taro. Liaina has 1 year of experience in this business.  \r\n\r\nLiaina needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase harvesting equipment, such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 talas or US $63 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Liaina joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan from SPBD. SPBD's loans are Liaina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan from traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

F. is 39 years old. She is married and has 5 children.  She owns a business catching and selling ocean fish.  Faavevela has 2 years of experience in this business.  \r\n\r\nFaavevela needs a loan of WST 1500 to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 80 talas or US $33 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faavevela joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan from SPBD. SPBD's loans are faavevela's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan from traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

I. is 52 years old, married and has 7 children.  She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Orepa needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 80 talas or US $33 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Orepa joined SPBD. This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Orepa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Aiolupetea is 49 years old, married and has 7 children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale. Selina has 2 years of experience in this business. Selina needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 talas or US $42 per week) to pay her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Selina joined SPBD. This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Selina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

T. is 23 years old, married, and has 2 children.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 talas or US $50 per week) to pay her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lilieni joined SPBD. This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lilieni's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

T. is 42 and married with 4 children.  She owns a business planting and harvesting taamu for sale.  Sinaleimoa has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sinaleimoa needs a loan of WST$1200 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 talas or about US$63 per week) to pay her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sinaleimoa joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Sinaleimoa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

L. is 30 years old, married and has 1 child.

Palolo needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 80 talas or US $33 per week) to improve and expand her business.\n\nIn 2010, Palolo joined SPBD. This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Palolo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout  SPBD: \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

B. is 55 years old, married, and has 6 children. She owns a business venture, selling lavalavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women). Talosaga has 3 years of experience in this business. Talosaga  needs a loan of WST$2500 to purchase additional equipment & tools such as needles & threads. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Talosaga  joined SPBD. This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Talosaga 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 58 years old, married, and has 3 children. She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam). Mariana has 4 years of experience in this business. Mariana needs a loan of WST$2500 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Mariana joined SPBD. This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Mariana 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

L. is 39 years old, married, and has 4 children. She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam). Lepapa has 3 years of experience in this business. Lepapa needs a loan of WST$2000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 talas or US $63 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lepapa joined SPBD. This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lepapa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 34 years old, married, and has 4 children. She owns a business venture, selling lavalavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women). Epenesa has 1 year of experience in this business. Epenesa needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 talas or US $63 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Epenesa joined SPBD. This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Epenesa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

A. is 48 and married with 4 children.  She owns a business planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Nora has 3 years of experience in this business.  Nora needs a loan of WST$2000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 talas or US $50 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nora  joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Nora's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

V. is 28 and married with 4 children.  She owns a business planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Faasulu has 1 year of experience in this business.  Faasulu needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 talas or US $63 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Faasulu joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Faasulu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

P. is 38 and married with four children.  She owns a business venture selling lava lavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women).  Judith has one year of experience in this business.  Judith needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional equipment & tools such as needles & threads.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 90 talas or US $38 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Judith joined SPBD.  This is her first loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Judith's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii and Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

L. is 61 and married with six children.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 talas or US $42 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nive joined SPBD. This is her first loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Nive's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

F. is 56 and married with one child.

Akenese needs a loan of WST $1700 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Akenese joined SPBD.  This is her fourth loan with SPBD.

J. is 36 and married with 4 children.  She owns a business planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Silieni has 1 year of experience in this business.  Silieni needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 talas or US $63 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Silieni joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Silieni's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 34 and married with four children.

Ane needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ane joined SPBD.

S. is 51 and married with six children.  She owns a business venture selling wooden handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Ulata has two years of experience in this business.  Ulata needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ulata joined SPBD.  This is her second loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Ulata's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Sivai is an active client and wishes to expand the business and assist her family financially.\r\n\r\nThis is Sivai's 4th loan with SPBD.

L. is 38 and married with three children.  She owns a business venture planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Motuli has two years of experience in this business.  Motuli needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nMotuli joined SPBD. This is her second loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Motuli's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as to Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

F. is 37 and married with 4 children.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nFaasalusalu is a hard working client and wishes to expand her business and assist her family financially.\n\nFaasalusalu joined SPBD since 2007.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faasalusalu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 28 and married with 4 children.  She owns a business venture, which involves planting and harvesting taro (a root vegetable) for sale.  Ana has many years of experience in this business.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ana joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ana's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in S. to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

M. is 42 and single with no children.  To earn a living, she plants and harvests taro for sale.  Mareta has many years of experience in this business.  Mareta needs a loan of WST$1000 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nMareta joined SPBD this year, and this will be her first loan from SPBD. SPBD's loans are Mareta's only access to capital because she has never been  able to qualify for a loan from traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

I. is 49 and married with 4 children (ages 12 - 19).  She owns a business venture, planting and harvesting bananas for sale.  Tepa has many years of experience in this business.  Tepa needs a loan of 1500 WST to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tepa joined SPBD. This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tepa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

U. is 46 and married with 5 children (ages 12 - 22).  She plants and harvests taro to sell.  She has many years of experience in this business.  Taumaia needs a loan of 3,000 WST to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or $167 per week) to continue to improve her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Taumaia joined SPBD.  This is her 6th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Taumaia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

F. is 25 and married with 2 children, ages 12 and 14.  She owns a business venture, planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables to sell.  She has many years of experience in this business.  Tafaoata needs a loan of 1,000 WST to rent land to raise additional crops.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or $125 per week) to expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tafaoata joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tafaoata's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

V. is 48 and married with 3 children, ages 12 - 21.  She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  She has many years of experience in this business. Tafaimaa  needs a loan of 1,500 WST to purchase new items to expand her product offering.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or $104 per week) to improve her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Tafaimaa joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tafaimaa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

M. is 34 and married with 6 children (ages 8 - 19).  She owns a business venture, planting and harvesting taamu for sale. (Ta'amu in Samoa is cooked and eaten as a root vegetable like taro.)  She has many years of experience in this business.  Epenesa needs a loan of 1,000 WST to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or $146 per week) to improve her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Epenesa joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Epenesa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

A. is 18 and is single with no children.

S. is 45 and married with 1 child (1 year old).  He owns a business providing women's tailoring services to local community members.  Tise has 3 years of experience in this business.

He plans to use the earnings from his business (estimated to be 400 talas or US$167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tise joined SPBD.  This is his 2nd loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Tise's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.
