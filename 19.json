sells fagusea (seafood) and faiaipusi (eel in coconut cream).

Although these are good revenues, she finds that with six children, her weekly income only just covers her weekly expenses. However, Leama is not ready to give up. She believes that growing her business is the only way that she will be able to improve her family's standard of living and be able to start a savings account.

Vann Sina has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-22T22:07:29Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:30:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9243,"name":"Khumare","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khumare A.

Kiva Lender,\r\n\r\nGreat news! Huy Vong Rachana'has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-23T05:57:16Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T03:05:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9245,"name":"Nhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nhan S. is 54 years old and lives in Phnom Penh, Cambodia with her husband (who appears in the photo) and their 5 children.

Chea Sotheary has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-24T15:56:32Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T03:35:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9249,"name":"Subhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Subhan E. owns and operates a clothing shop in the town of Devechi\u2019s bazaar.

Lay Heng has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-26T22:34:39Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:59:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9252,"name":"Arif","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arif H. owns and operates a refrigerator and washing machine repair shop in the town of Devechi, which is located on the North Eastern coast of Azerbaijan.

Kiva Lender,\r\n\r\nGreat news! SeM Samuon has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-24T16:47:32Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T03:00:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9254,"name":"Vusal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vusal M.

Som Chanta has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-26T23:17:41Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T02:00:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9260,"name":"Surkhay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Surkhay is a local resident of Beylagan.

Because of her cheerfulness and good service her total number of customers is consistently growing. Reasonable prices, hard-work and tenacity have helped her enterprise reach sustainability and success. The twenty loans she has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d are another reason why her business has been so successful. While working with our organization, Nadiya was able to purchase her fourth vending facility and increase her sales volume. \r\n<p>\r\nNadiya has requested a loan for $600 to purchase 10 kilograms of dried mushrooms and a variety of different spices and seasonings that she will sell in her kiosks.  This loan will help her re-supply her inventory and encourage more customers to come and buy from her. Increased sales will generate the necessary funds to sustain her business as well as to meet her family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0412 \u041d\u0430\u0434\u0456\u0457 \u2013

In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again.

Chea Sareth has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI.

is married with a 14-year-old son. She started out as an entrepreneur selling shoes in the busiest city market in Zaporozhye. She had to make frequent trips to remote wholesale centers to purchase inventory in bulk which took too much of her time and energy. Larisa decided to broaden the assortment of goods she sold by adding clothing items. This helped her reduce transportation time and expenses by not having to make as many trips to buy additional inventory. \r\n<p>\r\nLarisa is a serious and prudent business owner. Her perseverance in combination with lending services from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d has ensured the stable expansion of her business. Even with high competition in this sphere of trade, Larisa\u2019s pleasant manner and willingness to meet customers needs have helped her keep loyal clientele. Larisa has been in this business for 6 years. Currently, she has about $1,200 in inventory. Her net profit amounts to about $300 per month. \r\n<p>\r\nLarisa is requesting a loan for $1,200 to use as working capital. She is planning to expand her selection of clothing and shoes by introducing new items which she hopes will attract more customers to her little kiosk. Larisa is planning to invest generated profits into the further expansion of her business and eventually she would like use some to remodel her apartment.

was born in Russia and later moved with her family to Ukraine. She entered college in Berdyansk and obtained a degree in elementary education. She also gained a good understanding of people\u2019s psychology which has helped her launch her own business and attract many customers. Currently, Ludmila is a successful entrepreneur selling clothing items in one of the local markets in Berdyansk. She usually purchases inventory in bulk from Russia to resell in Ukraine. She gives preference to Russian wholesalers because their purchasing prices are relatively low, and their inventory is characterized by exceptional quality. \r\n<p>\r\nLudmila learned about \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d from her friends who have been working with our organization for many years. Her business has benefited considerably from micro-lending services since 2003 when she received her first loan.   \r\n<p>\r\nLudmila is married with a 20-year-old daughter and a grown son. She has invested her life in her family. Her personal example is the best proof that hard-work and integrity can enable one to be successful in business. Presently, Ludmila has over $4,000 in inventory. She re-stocks her clothing twice a month. Her monthly gross income amounts to $6,000, and her net profit is about $1,200. She has requested a loan of $1,200 to re-supply her inventory and increase her working capital. Ludmila believes that offering a variety of clothing items will help her retain existing customers and find new ones while providing superior service in a competitive marketplace.

runs a small business where he offers tire repair services. He is married and has a son and a daughter. Igor has gained much rich experience in car repair and mechanical work. His gross revenue per month currently amounts to around $800, and his monthly net profit is about $500.\r\n<p>\r\nIgor has been working with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d since 2004. He has gained a reputation as a responsible entrepreneur and a man of integrity. With financial assistance he has been able to purchase a workshop facility for his business. His tire repair business has been very profitable as there is always a need for good car mechanics that are knowledgeable in vehicle repair.      \r\n<p>\r\nIgor is a Christian and he realizes that God has helped his business to be sustainable and successful. He is requesting a loan for $600 that will enable him to finish some reconstruction on his workshop facility and improve his quality of service. Igor believes that this financial assistance will give him the chance to provide professional service and best meet his customers\u2019 needs. Additional generated profits will help Igor improve his family\u2019s living standards and will allow him to make more investments into the further expansion of his venture.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0412

is married with a 3-year-old son. For awhile he worked for a transportation company. However, the organization went bankrupt and Sergei was forced to find other ways to support his family. That is how he ended up as a taxi driver. Today he owns a car and provides transportation services throughout Ukraine. The business is the only source of income for his family. Sergei works very hard, sometimes without days off or vacation, in order to bring in enough income. He uses a walkie-talkie to help him facilitate his work and get right to a pick-up a lot faster. \r\n\r\nSergei has been in this business for 10 years. His determination and strong will to succeed have helped him keep his business stable and sustainable and have promoted its expansion. Sergei has received and paid back 23 different loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. Currently, his daily income is about $30-40. \r\n\r\nSergei would like to get a loan for $1,000 to fix the engine and do some welding work on his car. One of his long-term plans is to eventually purchase a new vehicle. We are confident that the modesty, diligence and responsibility that have helped Sergei develop his venture and gain a good reputation among other taxi drivers will help him promptly repay this loan

Sreng Chantha has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-25T05:34:40Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T03:22:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9474,"name":"Um","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Um M.

Since she inherited their land she has been working hard to prepare the land to be vibrant enough to grow vegetables for resale.  The land needs a lot of repairs especially the greenhouses, which were erected poorly. She does not have sufficient monetary resources to repair these greenhouses and buy saplings to grow for commercial use.  These greenhouses are a new venture for Elena, she has studied about the benefits of using greenhoueses and is confident on the possiabilities for success. She would like a loan to purchase additional plastic film to cover her greenhouses and seedlings to grow different vegetables to start saplings and then transplant them to her land.

Phai Hong Hai has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-26T00:37:52Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T03:28:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9546,"name":"Johnstone","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Johnstone Kyalo M. is a 31-year-old married man with one child.

During this period (2000-2005), Kyalo was employed by an Indian national, and his job was to sew round buttonholes. After some time, Kyalo realized that sewing round buttonholes was a dead-end job, and he approached a colleague, asking to be trained as a tailor. His colleague accepted, provided Kyalo paid for the training. Kyalo trained for 3 years and became an expert tailor. \r\n\r\n<p>In April 2005, Kyalo decided that it was no longer worthwhile to stay in his job, and he left to start his own business. Armed with Ksh. 15,000 (USD 214) that he had saved over time, Kyalo bought a second-hand sewing machine and some cloth, and he started tailoring skirts and dresses for small girls. He took these dresses to the open-air market, where they sold like hot cakes. The business is doing well. \r\n<p>Now Kyalo wants to expand his business, because he gets more clients every day. He now  employs 3 helpers, creating employment opportunities in the community.\r\n\t\r\n<p>Johnston Kyalo is kindly asking for a loan of USD 525.  With the loan, he intends to purchase more cloth and other materials, including zippers, hooks, thread, canvas, shoulder pads, buttons, and lining materials.

Sorn Sophat has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-26T16:59:51Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T01:55:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9548,"name":"Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ann Wamaitha K. is a 53-year-old married woman who cares for her 3 children and 2 of her sister's children. Her sister can't take care of her two children, and Ann has taken them on as her own, housing and educating them. Ann lives in Mlolongo, an informal settlement along Nairobi-Mombasa highway.   \r\n\t\r\n<p>Ann\u2019s story is one of the phoenix rising from ashes. Ann started her business in 1997 with  savings of Ksh 1500 (USD 21). With this samll amount of seed money, Ann started a tailoring business in a wooden structure called a \u201ckibanda\u201d in Swahili. As fate would have it, Ann was involved in an accident in 1998, which left her with an injured spinal cord and a broken left arm. Ann needed metal plates in her arm and was confined to bed rest for 3 years. \r\n\t\r\n<p>In  2000 she recovered a bit and borrowed Ksh 5,000 (USD 71) from her husband, who was moved by Ann's determination. With this money she bought plastic items (cups, plates, trays, jugs, basins) and sufurias (cooking pots) and started selling food in a small stall. The business did so well that, in July 2006, she managed to rent a shop for Ksh 2,500 (USD 36) in Mlolongo. So far she has taken out three small loans of Ksh. 10,000 (USD 145) from a small NGO society (COSWE), which lends a maximum of USD 145 to people starting out in business. She has so far managed to repay the loans.  Through God\u2019s grace and with the small loans she has received, Ann has managed to increase her inventory.\r\n<p> Because the community is getting larger every day, she would like to increase her stock even more and offer new goods, including knitting yarn, baby clothes, blankets, and bedsheets. \r\n\t\r\n<p>Ann is kindly asking for a loan of USD 775 with which to stock her shop and serve the community better. The repayment period is 8-14 months.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":33078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Mon Vutha has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT MFI, Cambodia\r\n"}],"funded_date":"2007-04-27T00:41:11Z","paid_date":"2008-03-04T03:32:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":9552,"name":"Mazgan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mazgan is 30 years old and lives with members of her family in district 6 of Kabul, Afghanistan.

V. is 40 years old and lives with her 5 children in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Two of her children help contribute to the family by working in a local garment factory, while the other three children are still in school. V. hopes to use this loan to help construct a small house for her family, as they currently live in a tiny cottage with a poorly constructed roof--with not nearly enough support to keep the house from leaking during the rainy season.

Ang Vong has repaid the Kiva loan early! Kiva and CREDIT MFI make every effort to be as transparent as possible so you can trust the information we give you. In this case, we didn\u2019t let you know that the loan had been repaid at the time. Occasionally, when a loan is repaid early, the payment schedule posted on Kiva doesn\u2019t always match the records of our micro finance partner in Cambodia, CREDIT MFI. As in life, the system doesn\u2019t always run perfectly, but when there is a discrepancy we will alert you as soon as possible so you have all the information about your investment.\r\n\r\nOn the upside, the issue occurred because the client\u2019s business is so successful! Your loan made that possible. Soon you will see a repayment posted on the client\u2019s profile that is larger than the usual amount. This will end the loan and return the funds to your account. We hope you will choose to loan the repaid funds to another entrepreneur who would a like a chance to grow their business as well. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please post them as a comment on this borrowers site and I will be happy to respond. I also encourage you to write comments on the pages of your loan recipients so we can pass along your good wishes to the borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the oversight and are putting policies in place to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. Thank you for giving poor entrepreneurs in Cambodia a chance at success! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSopheap Khiev, Kiva partnership coordinator, Cambodia\r\nMr. Chan Mach, General Manager, CREDIT
