S. is from the village of Baybay Panalsalan Plaridel, Misamis Occidental. She is 44 years old. Emma is married and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, Emma owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a \"sari-sari\" general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling retail products such as shampoo, soap, edible oil, toothpaste etc., Emma has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Emma joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emma is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional produts to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Emma from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is 37 years of age, married, and has three children. Taiwo sells drinks by wholesale and retail. She started the business about six years ago, and she has been in LAPO for three years now. She purchases her drinks from Ikeja and Ikosi. According to Taiwo, her profit is over NGN 30,000 per month. She buys drinks over NGN 40,000 every week, which makes her goods demanding.

To make a living, L. operates a family member's business venture running a general store where she sells daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.  L. has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 3.500.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, L. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  L. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2.436.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  She is now requesting a new loan of 5.014.000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the third loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  L. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

is a 24-year-old single businessman. He lives in the Gasabo district, a region of Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda.\r\n\r\nBonaventure owns a retail general store in this area selling different goods that include foodstuffs, cosmetic goods and other items.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.028.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.

Their common business is selling different products in their shop and different kinds of beer. This is their fifth successful year in this business, which they operate from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day except Sunday.\r\n\r\nThis group is requesting the loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company in order to expand their business.

Jeanne lives together with her children and her husband. She helps her husband with the raising and education of the children, but it is primarily Jeanne's husband who is the head of the household. Jeanne stopped her studies in high school and soon learned the weaving trade. She has done this business for 20 years. In addition to this worke, Jeanne began to sell food (rice with tomato sauce and fried fish) at home. Jeanne stocks up in Dantokpa, the international market of B\u00e9nin.

He lives in a brick house with basic services located in the Para\u00edso de Guayaquil area. When he was young, his father began a business making breads.

His wife helps with the household costs, working in sales in a store. They have 6 children, one who is already grown that they support, and 5 who are still in a fiscal school close to their home.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, he wants to buy bags of flour, eggs, and sugar so that he can grow his neighborhood bakery.

She is located in a periurban (immediately adjoining an urban area; between the suburbs and the countryside)  area and has a cement house with few basic services.  She began to learn to style hair at the age of 15 and at the age of 18 began to work as a stylist where she learned how to run a beauty salon.  This was her motivation to set up her own salon at age 24 by renting a small locale for it.  Miriam currently does 20 hair cuts per day.  On weekends she does hair coloring and straightening.  She begins her work day at 9am and works until 6pm.  One of the complications inherent in the area where she lives is the number of robberies.  Already on one occasion she lost all her equipment and tools to them.  Although her husband helps out with household expenses with his earnings as a conductor, she wants to insure her 15-year-old only daughter's, who is in private school, future.  With the loan she will buy more hair dryers, hair coloring agents, hair straighteners.  In the future, Miriam wants to have more beauty products for women so that she can attract more customers and thus provide more to insure her family's future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":446946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To buy beauty salon supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2009-12-14T16:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miriam Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83.82},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":97.08},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98.02},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":103.08},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":105.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":118.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.82},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.02},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.08},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.82,"local_amount":83.82,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":83.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074042,"comment":null},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":93.18,"processed_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":93.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910009,"comment":null},{"amount":97.08,"local_amount":97.08,"processed_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":97.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945574,"comment":null},{"amount":359.97,"local_amount":359.97,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":359.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673937,"comment":null},{"amount":165.95,"local_amount":165.95,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":165.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631580,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-15T15:24:01Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":161544,"name":"El Pari Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Las socias del banco comunal \"El Pari\" est\u00e1n representado por la se\u00f1ora Beatriz y conformada por 14 miembros  que van ingresando a su tercer ciclo juntos demostrando honestidad y responsabilidad en sus pagos sin escatimar esfuerzos por sacar adelante sus peque\u00f1os negocios D. venta D.  comida, cosm\u00e9ticos, verduras, productos l\u00e1cteos, ropa celulares, elaboraci\u00f3n y venta D. pan y al transporte publico D. pasajeros.

All of them are hard workers as demonstrated each day when they open their vending stalls early to sell chicken, empanadas, cosmetics, food, jewelry, and clothing.  Some members provide amplification and electrical services.  In the retail sectors involving food, clothing, and beauty products, there is much competition, so the members are forced to keep their businesses moving to different markets.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used for the acquisition of merchandise, supplies, and tools to improve their earnings and increase their household incomes.

Although the competitive environment is always present, the members make an effort to succeed in their small businesses, starting earlier than the rest of the vendors buying merchandise during that time, or offering products that are different than those that are present in the market. The destiny of the funding is for acquisition of additional merchandise, inputs, and tools that will help them generate more business to sustain their families and give their children a better quality of life, since they are the reason that they are working.

The members of the group are going through another cycle within the institution, demonstrating great punctuality and diligence in their work, so that they will always have the helping hand of Agrocapital to support them in their projects. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

Eleanor joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000, with the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in a general store, pig fattening and a rice farm. Now, she earns an average monthly income of  PHP 8,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nEleanor is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 was used to fund operations of her general store and rice farm, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now, on her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing the amount of PHP19,500, which she intends to use for her general store.

51 year old mother who strives very hard to help improve the living condition of her family, engaging in a different kind of business where she can get an income for a living. Merlanie L. lives in the village of Hda. Bubog, Brgy. Bubog, Talisay City, Negros Occidental. She is married to Pedro who works as a fisherman and sometimes helps his wife with her business. The couple is blessed with 4 children ages 13 to 34 years old. Some of their children help them with their business.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, Pedro's income was just enough when the children were still small. But as time goes by she noticed that their household expenses were gradually increasing specially for the food and education of their children. She then helped her husband fish and peddle it in her community. But she wanted to put up her own business as an additional income for their family. \r\n\r\nIn 2004, Merlanie's friend encouraged her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon as a group member so she can get a loan for the General Store. Upon joining, the business brought additional income to the family and helped with the education of their children. As her business continued, she was able to expand it because of her successive loans. As her loans continued, she was able to help her husband in putting another source of income catching crabs, and bale to buy fish net for fishing. From this business she was able to earn Php 8,000 per month. She saves most of her income for her children and for her family.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of Php 9,500 for her general store business was fully paid and she was able to access a bigger loan with the next cycle. At present, her 9th cycle loan in the amount of Php 12,000 will be used for the repair of her fishing boat, buy other fishing equipments and for her general store.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\").

B. is 55 years old and lives in the village of Prk Calayugan, Brgy Sampinit, Bago City, Negros Occidental. Her husband, Andres, helps her in running her businesses, especially their rice farm. The couple is blessed with four children aged from 23 to 33 years old. Two of their children have their own families already while the other two are single and attending school. Emma also has three grandchildren. She wants her two single children to finish their studies, and hopes that the business will continue to help her grandchildren and bring progress to the whole family.\r\n<br>Emma opened a general store with her own small capital. As the store generated a limited income, she wanted to expand it, and so decided to become a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon where she could access additional capital and buy different items to sell. The loans helped her to increase her income, which is why she was able to set up a new business \u2013 pig fattening. In addition, right in front of her general store she was able to sell fruits such as bananas and slices of papaya. From this business, she was able to earn a minimum of 7,500 PHP per month, which she used to save for her children's education and for family expenses.\r\n<br>Emma's previous loan of 15,000 PHP was used as additional working capital for her general store. It was paid in full and on time. Now, she has borrowed 18,000 PHP to buy additional products for her general store and feed for her pig-fattening business. The income generated from her businesses will be saved for education and family expenses.

This has been her way of providing for herself and helping her husband to pay for basic needs such as water and electricity. Her husband works as a sales agent.\r\n\r\nShe raised three children. Two of them are adults and the third is still in her care. In the last few months her sales have lagged, which has meant difficulties in making a profit, and delaying payments.\r\n\r\nAll of this has occurred because of the economic crisis in Nicaragua. Everything is more expensive and a drought has meant that the cost of basic goods has gone up. This, as well as the many people who are unemployed, are the causes of her poor sales. With earlier loans, Nancy has been able to invest in inventory to prepare her foods. Now she needs to build a bathroom and enclose the toilet in order to improve the hygiene in her home and provide her family with more privacy.

Es por eso la necesidad de aumentar su inventario.","en":"For several years Fanny has had a store selling various clothes in a stall in the market.  She sells second hand clothes that are in good condition for a good price.  She started because she needed to be able to help her five children, who are all grown, and her husband with some expenses.  In time, two children emigrated to the United States.  They send money, but her biggest wish is to be able to see them again.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to set up a clothing establishment in her house to profit from being in the neighborhood.  She sells a lot because her prices are low.  Everything is expensive, and many Nicaraguan families cannot afford the basics in food because of the economic situation in the country.  Hardships and unemployment are some of the factors in this crisis.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she wants to buy various bundles to increase sales and be able to earn more money.  In this month of December there are plenty of sales.  That is why she needs to increase her inventory.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

From the age of 10 on he helped them plant and later would see that harvests were good thanks to his help.

He thus makes the effort every day to plant more and earn good profits which will enable him to pay for his studies in the city.  Niger enjoys working the land very much and plans to enlarge his farmlands in order to plant more coffee and bananas.

He is involved in several trades at once, you might call him a \"jack of all trades\" because he is a coffee and banana grower, he makes furniture that he sells in the city at good prices, and, as if that weren't enough, he works as a mason when such services are required.  Pablo says that he has enough time for all this because the farming is done with help from his sons since he taught them when they were still very young the skills to make the land more productive.  He thus has plenty of time to shape the wood into beautiful furniture that he designs following his own creative impulses.  Occasionally, he works as a mason, a skill he learned as a young boy by watching his father.  These various jobs produce good earning for him because there are just a few carpenters and masons in the area where he lives.

O. is  a 59-year-old married woman who lives in the village of Brgy Maquiling Sagay City Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store, a rice retailing shop, and a restaurant.\r\n\r\nVeolita\u2019s husband helps her run the businesses, and they have three children; two of them are already grown and the youngest is currently going to school. All of the children help their parents in the businesses as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nVeolita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 in the hope that she would be able to help her  husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family's income by operating a general store, rice retailer and restaurant. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nVeolita is a member of good  standing. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 was used to fund the operation of her general store, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing PHP 19,000 in her sixteenth cycle loan, which she  intends to use on her businesses. Veolita is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family: to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of  thousands of women through Project \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\"--a title of esteem bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":447981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Artemia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nArtemia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Artemia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Artemia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Artemia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

R. is a 57-year-old married woman who lives in the village of Brgy Alimango, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by fishing\/fish vending.\r\n\r\nLydia\u2019s husband, Solomon, is a fisherman; they have one grown child who is currently going to school and also helps Lydia and Solomon in the business as part of daily chores.\r\n\r\nLydia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in fishing\/fish vending business. Now she earns an average monthly income of  PHP 7,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nLydia is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 was used to fund operations for her her fishing business and had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 for her tenth cycle loan, which she intends to use to buy fishing materials and for fish vending. Lydia is working  hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family: to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of  thousands of women through Project \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

is  a 36-year-old married woman who lives in the village of Villacen1, Prk Katilingban, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by buying and selling shoes and ready-to-wear clothes.\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s husband, Renato, helps her run the business. They have two children who are between 10- and 18-years-old. One is in college while the other one is in elementary school. They also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nElizabeth joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1993 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by buying and selling shoes and ready-to-wear clothes. Now she earns an average monthly income of  PHP 25,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 30,000 was used to fund operations for her business and had a positive impact in  both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now, she is borrowing PHP 29,000 for her thirteenth cycle loan, which she intends to use for her business. Elizabeth is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family: to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of  thousands of women through Project \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon  word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\"--a title of esteem bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

S. is from the village of Guinawon Panalsalan, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental. She is 49 years old. Myrna is married and has 5 school-aged children. \r\n<p>\r\nTo make a living, Myrna owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the business's main source of income comes from selling fish and alimango to the local community members. Myrna has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nMyrna joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myrna is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish and alimango for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Myrna from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Guimbala-on Silay City Negros Occidental. \r\n<p>\r\nHer husband Welfredo drives the jeep they own to deliver the soft drinks that they sell on a wholesale basis to different vendors around town. Yolanda also sells the soft drinks retail to her neighbors. \r\n<p>\r\nThe couple has 4 children who are between 6 and 18 years old. They all go to school at present. Yolanda and Welfredo already had this business even before she joined NWTF Project Dungganon in 2006, but it was the need for more capital to fund their expanding operations that prompted her to join. With the help of her loans she is able to purchase larger quantities of soft drinks to distribute to a network of regular stores that they have developed a relationship with over the years. \r\n<p>\r\nTo supplement their income, Yolanda also sells fruits, such as bananas, and used clothes in the store adjacent to her house. She earns about PHP 9,550 from her business activities and it helps a lot in paying for the education of her children and defraying the household expenses while allowing her to save up for the future.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her previous loan Php 23,000, she used it as additional working capital for her wholesale and retailing of soft drinks. The said amount was fully paid within her loan term, and contributed to the maintenance of her good credit performance with NWTF-Project Dungganon. Now she borrowing  for her 8th cycle loan the amount of Php 25,000 which she intends to use to fund the buying and selling of bananas and purchase soft drinks in bulk.

The loan was paid on-time and in full.\r\n<p>\r\nNow she is borrowing her 12th loan for the same amount of 19500 PHP to purchase additional inventory for her general store. The income from the loan will help support them with their family needs.\r\n<p>\r\n<em>\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

As she secured additional loans, she looked for other ways to earn money. Now she makes a living selling fish to people in her local community. From this businesses, she earns a minimum of PHP 11,800 per month.

is 48 years old and lives in the island of Binangonan, an attractive province of Rizal. She and her husband have three children. Judy Ann, 12 years old, is a high school student. Jeremie, 11 years old, and Jericho, 9 years old, are both in elementary grades. She is married to Hilario, a 52-year-old construction worker (laborer) and a supportive husband.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, she joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap Inc.) a microfinance institution and KIVA field partner in the Philippines. Amelia makes and sells food. She has been in business for more than 10 years. She believes that her proposed loan of Php 20,000.00 will be a big help and will contribute to the growth of her business. She will use all of the loans funds to buy rice, sugar, and an electric coconut grinder for her business. She will also start raising hogs for additional income.  \r\n\r\nAmelia dreams of sending her children to school and hopes that will complete a degree in college. She believes that poor families need support so that they can change their standard of living and build beautiful houses for their families to live. When she joined ASHI, she had only a \"bahay kubo\" (a small house made of bamboo) but with the benefit of loans and the support of ASHI in their lives, their small house of bamboo has become big one made of hollow blocks. Half of her dreams have been gradually achieved, but she is still dreaming about completing them. Amelia is a positive and optimistic mother who knows that she will overcome all challenges and achieve her dreams.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":448090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is 35 years old. Gina is the group leader of a 19-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nGina is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Gina runs a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products, such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste, in the local community. Gina has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 1,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Gina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Gina from ASKI.

A. is from the village of Lugait, Misamis Oriental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Linda has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Linda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Linda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Linda is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Linda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives in the Maica Chica area south of the city of Cochabamba.  Ariel got married a few months ago.  They live in his mother\u2019s house because they do not have enough money for their own house.  At this house he has the four dairy cows that were an inheritance his mother gave him when he turned 18.\r\n\r\nAriel raises dairy cows.  It is work that has been in his family for many generations.  Thanks to good cattle management, their small farm is well known in the area for the good quality of milk it produces.  Now that he has help from his wife, Ariel goes to an institution in the evenings to learn auto mechanics.  That way he will one day be able to open a mechanic\u2019s shop.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to build corrals to house the cattle.  This is the season when the rains start in the city of Cochabamba.  It is a problem for the cows when they do not have refuge.  That is why Ariel wants to build the corrals, so that the cows do not suffer from the rain storms.  By having a refuge, the cows will not have any problems.  Therefore, milk production will not decrease.  \r\n\r\nAriel\u2019s dream is to make his dairy farm grow and to open an auto mechanic shop, which is a hobby that he really likes.\r\n\r\n<br

They are small-scale businesspeople in the small town of Waterloo, near Freetown. They want to expand their businesses but lack the required capital to enable them to do so. They have thus formed themselves into a group of three and applied to SMT\/'Shine on Sierra Leone' for a loan of  SLL 500,000 each. With this loan, they can expand their businesses, make more sales and better profit. In this way, their living conditions will improve to a new level. <P>\r\n\r\nSulaiman K. on the left in the photo is the leader of this group. Sulaiman was born in Koindu in eastern Sierra Leone. He is married to a businesswoman and they have two children \u2013 one in class two and the other not yet of school-going age.

sus pocos ingresos y esfuerzo pudo comprar una carreta que le ayudar\u00eda a emprender el negocio que le asegurar\u00eda el futuro de su familia.\n\nHace ya 5 a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s pudo poner en su casa  una tienda peque\u00f1a de v\u00edveres en la que puede vender lentejas, fr\u00e9jol, frutas, arroz, etc. Una de las mayores dificultades de Rosa es cuidar las frutas que no se empolven y por

as\u00ed adecuarla mejor a las necesidades de las personas para poder asegurar el futuro de su familia. \n\n","en":"Rosa A. is 36.  She lives in an area with scant basic services, which is located in Para\u00edso de Guayaquil.  She has a brick house, and the road is not paved.\r\n\r\nTen years ago Rosa started selling fruits and vegetables from a basket by traveling to various areas near her house.  Later, with her small income and her effort, she was able to buy a cart.  The cart would help her establish the business that would assure her family\u2019s future.\r\n\r\nFive years ago she was able to set up a small grocery store in her house.  She sells lentils, kidney beans, fruit, and rice, etc.  One of the biggest difficulties Rosa has is taking care of the fruit so that it does not get covered in dust so that she can bring the food from long distances.  With help from her husband, a guard, she is able to support her two children.  They are seven and nine, and they attend public school near their house.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy more oil, soap, tuna, and sardines to expand her store.  In the future she wants to stock her store with school supplies.  That way she will better equip it with necessities in order to be able to assure her family\u2019s future.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva
