Nicol\u00e1s's life partner works with him selling milk products in the Terminal market in Le\u00f3n. He intends to invest in working capital so he can bring home the bread everyday. His dreams are to buy a machine that skims milk that holds more capacity so he can increase production. His dreams are also to better his life with the goal of giving his family a good place to live and to cover the necessities. He also has dreams of providing a good life and he would like this to prevail over everything else.\r\n\r\nHis source of income is the sale of milk products like cream, curd, and milk. His business is located in the Valley of the Zapata. He has had his business for 11 years. He began this business because he was not working due to a health issue. He left the work he did previously, which was the sale of beef. He sold his license in order to buy the treatment and he was left without a license. He decided to sell mik products since his wife sold the products. It was very easy for him since his wife taught him where customers went to search for milk products. Later, he and his wife decided to enter into the business of processing milk, which is their business now. The loan is for the working capital since he needs to make a higher profit and buy more cows for the production of milk products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Annie Sheng, Kiva

The location of his business is in his home. He has had the business for 6 years. Carlos started his business with one mill. With enough motivation and some financing, he was able to increase his business to two mills. They generate the majority of the profit for his family. Carlos would also like to do another type of business: raising and fattening pigs for sale. It would be another means of income but his principal interest is the milling business. His customers always come looking for milling service. He is requesting financing for working capital for maintaining the mill since the motor of the mill is giving him problems.

She has 2 sons.  Her eldest son is 5 years old and is in his third year of primary school.  Her younger son is 4 months old.  Recently, Brenda stopped her studies.  Her intention is to be able to continue to provide for her family, which she is able to do thanks to the income from her\r\nbusiness.  She wishes for her country's economy to improve, and hopes that this improvement would in turn improve her business so that she may achieve the success she needs.  Her dream is for God to grant her a long life so that she may be able to educate her grandchildren and see that they grow up knowing how to succeed professionally and how to handle the difficult situations that they may encounter in their lives.  In the more immediate future, Brenda wishes to move forward with her business, to no longer have sell her food as a street vendor, and to be able to sell her food from her home.  \r\n\r\nBrenda's business is selling the traditional food vigoron.  She sells it on the street, and has run her business for 2 years.  Brenda began her business on her own because the money that her husband earned was not sufficient to cover their household expenses.  Everything relied on the support of her family, who helped her with the business.  Her eldest son helped her to carry her food because she did not have anything that she could use to carry it when she went out to sell.  She and her son would walk the streets looking for customers who would appreciate her delicious vigoron.  Eventually she decided to get a cart to carry her food, because her son was growing tired from carrying it around every day.

She has 5 children, whose ages are as follows: her oldest son is 42 years old, her next son is 39 years old, her daughter is 35 years old, and her youngest son is 33 years old.  All of her children support themselves.  Her partner sells footwear.  \u00c1ngela hopes to grow her clientele as well as her inventory, and by doing so to remain competitive in the market.  Her dream is to earn enough money to no longer require loans for business capital, so that she will be able to be economically independent, while also saving enough money to provide for her and her husband's future.  She and her husband still both work very hard in spite of their age.  Her dream is for her family to remain united, so that she may stay close to her children and grandchildren as time passes on.  She would like to live longer so that she may spend even more time with her family, and wants to continue helping her daughter to raise her grandchildren, so that she can help ensure that they are brought up well.  \r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela's business sells both baked goods and footwear.  She sells the two items in different places; footwear is sold in the central market, and baked goods are sold out of her home.  She has been running her business for 3 years.  She initially sold soft drinks, but this didn't earn enough money to sustain her entire family, since her husband was not working at the time.  Needing to find another source of income, she decided that her husband should sell footwear while she would make and sell baked goods. In this way, they would both be able to work toward improving their family's finances and moving them forward in the world.  The purpose of the loan is to provide capital with which \u00c1ngela would purchase corn, school shoes, the children's game payana, firewood, and cheese, so that she may provide more of the delicious baked goods and other items that her customers demand. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is married and has a child. Oteka\u2019s business is sewing traditional women\u2019s dresses. Three years ago, she started offering her services as a seamstress to her neighbors and acquaintances. She conducts this work with only one sewing machine right now. She sells finished clothes in the market. <P>\r\n\r\nFortunately, the good service that she offers and the good materials with which she works help her to make her small factory progress. Despite her young age, Oteka already has apprentices at her tailoring shop. As a result of the large quantity of orders, she needs to acquire another machine so she may satisfy the orders. For that reason in mind, she is asking for a loan of 2500 Somoni for a term of 10 months to buy a sewing machine.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

principal occupation is the cultivation and production of vegetables. She is an excellent and admirable farmer who received from her husband the techniques and secrets of this beautiful activity, skills that have allowed her to develop multiple agricultural capabilities and have especially granted her the possibility of maintaining her loving family in these times of numerous financial problems. <P>\r\n\r\nNasiba has two children who have been her aid in the most difficult moments of her life and are her principal motivation to progress. For this reason, she wishes to contribute to the dreams of each one of her children by furnishing their small home in the best way possible in order to open a small store there to cover her household\u2019s expenses.<P>\r\n\r\nNasiba requests your help in the form of a loan that will allow her to obtain greater revenues this year for the purpose of reaching each one of her goals. She is asking a loan of 1200 USD for the term of 11 months in order to purchase the seeds and mineral fertilizer, to be able to sow corn, and also with part of the loan she wants to buy cattle. Nasiba expresses her gratitude to everyone for supporting her and promises to repay the loan on time. <P>      \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married with 3 children. Begmurat is an optimistic, hard-working father. He works his land with love and dedication every day, so that it produces excellent vegetables. Begmurat has been  in agro-business for more than 7 years. In fact, he draws strength and vitality to make his products the best in the city. <P>\r\n\r\nThough growing vegetables is a very difficult and time-taking job, he hopes to gather a rich harvest. With this purpose he is requesting a loan of 1200 USD which he has committed to repay within 11 months. With the desire to realize his plan, Begmurat appeals to your generous hearts for a swift contribution. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Abdurazzok S. is 43 years old. He is married and has three children. Abdurazzok has a middle special education. His specialization is accounting. But he went over to agro-business because the salary was small. And with that small salary he has to feed his family and pay for his children\u2019s education. <P>\r\n\r\nAbdurazzok works hard to cultivate his produce such as wheat, onions, carrots, and other vegetables. He works from early morning till late at night, hoping to have a rich harvest. Abdurazzok sells his produce in the market where it is always in high demand due to its good quality. He also raises cattle. <P>\r\n\r\nHis works fills him with great optimism and allows him to help his beloved children. His goal is to improve the quality of his agricultural products even more and grow his business. Today Abdurazzok is requesting a loan of 1200 USD for a term of 11 months to buy greater quantities of fertilizer and also calves. Let's help Abdurazzok as he works hard to improve the quality of life for his family! <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married with 2 children. From the time he was young, Gulmat was learning to work in a small business with his parents. With a lot of sacrifice, he became a main producer in agriculture in the area where he lived. After he married, he continued working in the same business, watching the business grow as a result of his sacrifice, and seeing his family progressing more and more. <P>\r\n\r\nWith the income he was able to open a dispensary in his house and also raise cattle successfully. His hope is to continue growing and improving his business to offer a better future for his children, hoping to see them as professionals, ethical and hard-working. For this reason he is asking for a loan of 2500 Somoni for the term of 11 months. He wants this loan to buy livestock, as raising and selling animals generates an excellent profit margin.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Due to her location, her business is doing superbly, and the customers are very satisfied.  \r\n<p>\r\nConcerned about satisfying her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago and is on her first individual loan.  Before joining the Soro Yiriwaso loan program, she had certain difficulties in carrying out her work because of her scant working capital.  She plans to use this loan to buy 10 lengths of Wax HITARGET brand pagnes (colorful West African cloth), 10 lengths of Wax REAL brand pagnes, 3 dozen Gel, 4 dozen skin cream, 2 dozen hair extensions, and 2 boxes of different beauty soaps.  She gets her supplies in Bobo Dioulasso, Abidjan and Bamako (respectively, in Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Mali in West Africa).  And then she sells them retail in her luxury salon located in Sanoubougou II, Sikasso.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her business capital, to help with family expenses, and to pay the loan interest.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":262951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To sell fabrics, clothing, and beauty products  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":52122.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440362,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52122.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135741,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52122.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033542,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":52122.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620910,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52122.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019875,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-01T09:59:18Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86312,"name":"Omowumi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Omowumi B. is 31 years old and married with a child.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

With thanks to his perseverance and dedication his business expanded, and today the business employs his daughter (pictured), son and wife. Today he needs to buy additional food items to increase the variety of the goods that he sells. For this purpose, he is requesting a loan of $ 600 USD for the term of 6 months.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He is single with a nine year-old boy.  Apart from his son, Manix takes also care of two abandoned boys and a girl between the ages of 5 and 15. All of them attend school. Manix started his first business in 1995 as a money changer. His starting capital was $120 and he worked outdoors until 1999 when his monthly income allowed him to move his business indoors. He worked very hard and his business prospered. In 2001, his business working capital reached $1500. Unfortunately, he lost all of this money when thieves broke into his place of business and stole it.  Due to this traumatic event, Manix closed his business. He and his children went through a hard time as he had neither a job nor any income to support them financially. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Manix borrowed $200 from one of his best customers to re-launch his business. He re-launched it outdoors until August 2008 when he joined one of Hope\u2019s groups named \"Beny\".  Manix used the first loan he received from Hope last September to diversify his business. He added another type of business selling cellular phones. With the second loan he received from Hope, he reinforced his working capital. Currently, his business capital is equivalent to $700. His business makes about $200 of profit per month. Manix likes this business because it is profitable and it helps him become economically stable, especially concerning food, housing, electricity and water bills and school fees for his children. \r\n\r\nManix\u2019s business requires honesty and patience to keep his permanent customers. He is glad to join Hope\u2019s group because he hopes to enhance his business with Hope's loans. With the next loan from Hope, Manix is planning to move his business indoors in order to avoid the heavy rains during the rainy season and the strong sun. Manix sells in the most populated area located in the North Eastern area of

She buys the firewood in localities around Sikasso and the fabric in Bamako and Bobo Dioulasso ( in Mali  and in Burkina Faso, respectively) and sells it retail. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she expects to earn a monthly profit of 110,000 FCFA, which will be used essentially to bolster her working capital, to contribute to family expenses, and to make repayments on the loan. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":263048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"purchase of wax prints and firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":32266.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440371,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135750,"comment":null},{"amount":32.49,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033551,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620919,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019884,"comment":null},{"amount":32.51,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242635,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678153,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112410,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16133.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028066,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-02T01:42:24Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:14:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86360,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Peter M. is an enterprising Tanzanian man.

After making the soap from the waste cotton oil and caustic soda, she resells it retail to customers composed generally of women in her town.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to help with family expenses, to pay the loan interest, and to invest the rest in her business.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":263089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","use":"To make soap to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.34,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":86870.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440377,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":43435.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135756,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":43435.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033557,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":43435.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620925,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":43435.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019890,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-01T14:29:08Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86388,"name":"Wilson","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Wilson trabaja como portero en la Federaci\u00f3n de Lecheras de La Paz, tambien es peque\u00f1o microempresario y vende queso de leche; tiene una hija de 10 a\u00f1os y su esposa.

Luis is married and has 5 children: his oldest, 40, is in his 2nd year of high school, and works for himself; his son, 38, is in his 3rd year of high school; another son, 32, is in his 5th year of high school; his daughter, 26, is in her 3rd year of high school; and his youngest son, 26, is in his 4th year of high school.  All of Luis's children both work and study; they didn't have the opportunity to go to school before and now they want to.  His wife is a homemaker.  \r\n\r\nLuis's plans include improving his house for his family.  He would like to buy a pickup truck so he can better serve his customers and sell more firewood.  He would also like to upgrade his construction equipment.  Rosa's goal is to keep her business active so she can continue to generate more income for her family.  She would like to expand her business by hiring three women to help her out.  She also wants to offer more products to her customers.  Rosa wants to run a business that is more useful to her community so she can meet her customers' needs.  \r\n\r\nLuis and Reyna are in different lines of work.  Luis makes his living selling firewood, while Reyna makes and sells tortillas.  She works from her home and has been in business for 14 years.  Luis travels around, and has been in business for 15 years.  He had started out in a different business: he had 8 pigs, which he later sold, and used the money to buy a horse and wagon.  Later, one of his sons gave him the money to start his firewood business, and he paid his son back with his earnings.  He liked this business since it gave him income for his family and his customers bought plenty from him.  Reyna, on the other hand, started with her own money, which she earned working as a domestic.  She liked her tortilla business and she decided to stay with it.  She invested her earnings into her business, enabling her to start doing business from her home. \r\n\r\nReyna is seeking a loan to use as working capital, as she has to buy firewood, corn, and lime, and the price of corn is very high.  Luis is seeking a loan for working capital.  He plans to use the money to buy a power saw, to make his work easier.  He also needs to make improvements to his wagon and buy medicine for his horse.  The horse and wagon are necessary for his business, and he has to give his horse medicine.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":263094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-29T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:16Z","rounded_local_amount":896.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400025,"comment":null},{"amount":75.29,"local_amount":1338.48,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1499.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092023,"comment":null},{"amount":14.71,"local_amount":261.52,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":292.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985406,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":896.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446021,"comment":null},{"amount":45,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":896.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956660,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-30T04:37:47Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86394,"name":"Toyin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Toyin is 42 years old.

Also, Maria knows how to embroider and has obtained a job embroidering jackets for export in her home.\r\n<p>\r\nSince she has been involved with FINCA she has been punctual with her payments and she has not gotten herself into debt.  She has also attended talks on how to run her business.  She needs a loan of 1000 soles for the purchase of an extractor hood for her food business.  Maria\u2019s dream is to continue with her food business and that her children become professionals.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Breanne Kochert, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":263146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"For the purchase of an extractor hood for her food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T18:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":256.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397279,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:11:30Z","rounded_local_amount":256.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088983,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":256.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982319,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:50:38Z","rounded_local_amount":256.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442868,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-01T23:07:57Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:50:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86427,"name":"Adjo","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette dame habite le cr\u00e9dit d\u2019awatam\u00e9 \u00e0 adjidogom\u00e9, elle a pour activit\u00e9 la vente de chaussure et elle fabrique aussi des nattes pour revendre, ce commerce marche bien pour elle c\u2019est pour cel\u00e0 qu\u2019elle voudrait l\u2019agrandir en demandant \u00e0 WAGES son premier pr\u00eat d\u2019un montant de 150000F pour acheter des chaussures et des mat\u00e9riaux pour la fabrication de nattes.

This is an average family from Khujand, Tajikistan. However, Usmonjon is a unique entrepreneur. Together with his wife he has been selling women's underwear in the central city market for about 8 years. The secret of his success is simple: he tries to not only let their customers know the benefits of their products \u2013 he also gives them a sense of belonging which brings them back again and again. <P>\r\n\r\nHowever, Usmonjon doesn\u2019t want to stop where he is with his venture. Usmonjon is seeking a loan of 1000 USD to replenish the merchandise in his store. We believe that Usmonjon\u2019s desire to excel by pleasing his customers will determine his further success and encourage new customers to buy from him.  <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

U. is 34 years old. He has been married for about 10 years. His wife is a teacher in the local school. Currently Mukhtor does not work within his profession, but he tries to feed his family by being a merchant. Mukhtor has been running his business for about 2 years. He rents a retail store where he sells different kinds of housewares. His business is the main source of income for the family. <P>\r\n\r\nMukhtor is trying to have a wide range of goods with good quality to meet the requirements of his customers and to satisfy the needs of customers with different levels of income. Today, Mukhtor requests 800 USD for a term of 6 months. This is the first time that Mukhtor has asked for a loan through IMON International and Kiva. It will be used to buy more housewares in order to increase the range of his goods. Due to the profitability of his business, the determination of this micro-entrepreneur, and his experience in the business, this customer is qualified to receive this loan.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

has very good sense of humor and her jovial spirits help her face difficult times.

She wishes to buy more animals and in this way to increase her income. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He clearly remembers the time when he decided to become independent, with a small number of animals and a small patch of land. <P>\r\n\r\nTagainazar has more than 6 years of experience.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S.  is 37 years old. She is married and the loving mother of 4 children. All her children are in school. Lyutfiya's husband is a builder and his income is not very high; that is why she decided to start her own business so that she could help him cover their living expenses. She is selling teenagers' clothing in the local market of Dushanbe city. She is trying to have wide range of goods so as to be able to meet the requirements of her customers and to satisfy the needs of the customers with different levels of income. <P>\r\n\r\nToday Lyutfiya is requesting 600 USD with the purpose of purchasing additional merchandise to increase the range of her goods.

Be an important part of the growth of Lyutfiya\u2019s business! <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Despite his young age, he has been raising sheep already for three years. He tries to invest as much time as possible in his animals. He tries to bathe and vaccinate his animals, which is very tedious, because there is only one place to bathe the rams and it's not easy to reach. But without a doubt, the results please him: to be able to see clean and healthy animals is a great source of satisfaction. Now he plans to invest the money that he is requesting in the purchase of a good breed of livestock to improve the quality of his animals. He will then generate more income, and with it, improve his quality of life.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her profit from the business has increased extensively since she started her business.<P>\r\n\r\n Anorbi has a unique ability to analyze a merchandise market and find her niche.

With your help this will be possible.<P> \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For him to do this, he would like to request a loan of $225 to purchase an additional hog and to buy sacks of fertilizer to support their farming needs and have a good yield this harvest season. He hopes that through his business he can support the needs of their family and provide the daily school expenses for his youngest child. Avelino considers their village  a poor area because of its poor road conditions especially during the wet season when transportation is rare. Avelino says that he must work hard for the welfare of his family in order to attain his ambition in life.

That was how she got a taste for the business and was convinced that it left her sufficient revenue. Currently, she works in this business full-time, and thanks to her enthusiasm, she has made a name for herself in the market. However, her clients request more and more things each day, which is why Ehtibor is requesting a loan of 2000 Somoni, which she is willing to repay in a 7-month term.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Some of their income from their tricycle operation and vending business was invested in their piggery business as an alternative source of income.  \r\n\r\nIgnacia is asking for a loan of $275 that she will use for the continuous operation of their small businesses.

He plants different types of vegetables like: potato, onion, carrot, corn and etc. Shuhrat has constant clients to his crops, which means his crops have an assured sale. Besides farming, he also engaged in the business of making wooden doors and windows, together with his son. At his home, he has his own small workshop. The funds that he requests are for the purchase of seeds and fertilizer.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Seidy\" group is made up of Martha Janet who is 48 years old and her friend del Carmen Hern\u00e1ndez who is 40 years old.  Martha is married and has four children: a 30-year-old self-employed son; a 26-year-old self-employed daughter; a 23-year-old self-employed son; and a 17-year-old daughter in her first year of high school.  Her friend Inez is married and also has four children: a 20-year-old son in his second year of studying for a degree; a 16-year-old son in his fourth year of high school; a 13-year-old son in his second year of high school; and a 7-year-old son in Grade 3.  Inez's husband is a mechanic, while Martha's husband is a radio technician.  Their goals are similar: Martha mentions improving her standard of living, and Inez wants to improve her families' living conditions.  Both women are fighters who want to give their families a good start in life.  Martha wants to have her own establishment and increase her inventory so that she can offer her customers a greater variety of products than what she now has.  Inez want to open a diner with better conditions and make her customers comfortable so that she can attract more clients.\r\n\r\nThe women have different businesses: Inez has been preparing and selling food for 12 years from the small market of Santa Ana while Martha has been a street vendor for 20 years.  Inez started her business with her own money as she had in mind to establish herself in the market as this was the only way to get customers as she had to raise her children and so they would not lack for any necessities.  Thus, she decided to prepare and sell food.  Initially she sold a limited number of dishes such as rice, beans, eggs but with time she has been able to include dishes such as chicken, shredded beef and so on.  Martha is a street vendor; she opened her business on her own as she enjoys working and thought of selling clothes in this manner.  Initially she wanted to establish a set business locale but because the taxes were very high she decided it would be preferable to be a street vendor.

She is also very preoccupied about the future of her children; one of her biggest challenges in life was to drop out of school to raise her children. She hopes to go back to school in the future and get a better education so she can provide better for her young children. On behalf of Esperanza, Francisca and the Fuente de Paz Bank of Hope, thank you for your support!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":263585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

mother of two children. Francisco is a 38-year-old electrician and Fabio is 22 years old and in his third year of law school. Olga has been a seamstress since she was 12 years old and learned the craft from her grandmother and mother, who were also seamstresses, but she was not content. She decided to go to school and studied three years of sewing and cutting, two years of crafts and one more year to earn the title of professor of sewing and cutting. She says after 16 years she is well known for her work and has made bridal gowns. <p>\r\nShe had to work very hard because she was the eldest of 10 siblings, whom she had to provide for because their mother was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Through an Italian priest, she was able to come in contact with a commander of the Italian Air Force, who helped her set up her sewing shop and sign a contract with a group clothing children of scarce resources. She did this for more than 10 years. <p>\r\nThe demand to make uniforms has increased and it's for this reason she has placed her confidence in Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya in supporting her to acquire a new sewing machine and fabrics, which will help her continue carrying out her daily work that she does with such effort and dedication.\r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Z. is 28 years old, single and has no children. Her intention is to keep working since she has a long time to make headway and she would like to generate more income for her family. She provides for her mother and sisters. Her wish is to finish her studies because it is an opportunity her parents never had, and thanks to her efforts she is fulfilling her dreams of being able to offer the same opportunity to her future children. It's for this reason she must save for the future as well as establish a more stable business. <p>\r\nLissett makes a living selling clothing and cosmetics at an outdoor sales post, which she has been doing for six years. She started the business for her family because for a long time this had been their means of income but due to economic circumstances they were forced to give up the business. From this came the inspiration to decide to re-establish the family business on her own and regain their source of income. She chose to start out with just a few products, such as underwear and candy, and sold the products in The Terminal outdoor market. Her desires to make headway were ever stronger because she also had to repay the debts she took on to start it. Little by little she acquired the capital necessary to make progress with her business, and nothing came easy because she not only had to make the sales but also make the purchases. Only time helped her adapt to surviving in this line of work, to which she is now requesting a loan to purchase products such as cosmetics, clothing and school supplies since school season is nearing. She also needs to travel to Managua and Chinandega because those are the best areas to make these purchases.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":263598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase products such as cosmetics, clothing and school supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-31T00:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lissett Benita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":837.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400028,"comment":null},{"amount":65.72,"local_amount":1314.41,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1321.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092026,"comment":null},{"amount":17.61,"local_amount":352.25,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":354.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985409,"comment":null},{"amount":43.23,"local_amount":864.55,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":869.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446024,"comment":null},{"amount":40.11,"local_amount":802.11,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":806.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956663,"comment":null},{"amount":291.66,"local_amount":5833.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-16T18:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5863.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174086,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Her wish is to establish a convenience store with all the necessary elements and dedicate herself completely to the business and receive a pension, since she needs the income to pay for her medications. Lidia has looked for a way to work, and in doing this started selling beans, firewood and beverages, among other items, and always has enjoyed it. She taught her children the trade so they'd learn the difficulty of hard work and making money. Her dream is for God to grant her a long life so she can teach her children to work hard and how to administer her business, since it is important for them to have a source of income. <p>\r\nLidia's main economic activity is selling undergarments, beverages, cooked beans and firewood. Her business is located in her home on the side of Dilectus restaurant. She has had her business for 12 years, which started out of her desire to make headway and out of the necessity to find a source of income to cover household expenses and provide for her two daughters. With a fixed primary educational plan, the idea came to her she could teach her children and also tend to her business. That way when she gave them lessons in the mornings she could take care of the business as well, and in the afternoons could focus fully on her work.  As time passed she decided to start offering undergarments by order and on credit. She is requesting a loan to purchase beauty products and other convenience store products to take advantage of the season and because her clientele is constantly requesting new products.<br

F. is 23 years old, and single. Carlos doesn't have children, and he'd like to continue innovating his business. Carlos sells tortillas, clothes, and cosmetics. His business is located in his home in Malpaisillo, and he's had the store for 14 years. Carlos opened the store because he had a responsibility to his home and had to support his mother and sisters. He therefore began to make tortillas, and sell them on the streets of Malpaisillo. He began to earn customers by demonstrating his dynamism when selling his products. Even so, his earnings were not enough to sustain his family so he began to sell clothing, such as: childrens' suits, skirts, shirts, and pants. After doing his rounds selling tortillas, Carlos would continue on to sell clothing. This was a success because some clients who bought tortillas also took the opportunity to buy clothing.\r\n\r\nHis business is growing slowly because he still doesn't have a family of his own to support, only his mother and his sisters. This hard-working, young entrepreneur dreams of helping establish a general store and he'd like his mother to manage the finances. Carlos is responsible for supporting her and with this business he'd earn enough to do so. Carlos wouldn't find it difficult to capture the attention of his customers with a general store, because it would be much easier than with his current business. Carlos would one day like to own his home, as he currently lives with his mother but would like to become more independent. He'd also like to give his mother the basic commodities and a nice home where his future family will live.\r\n\r\n Now Carlos needs working capital to invest in his products, because the school year is beginning and he'd like to stock his store. Carlos personally thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and its partner organizations of for all of their work in support of people who enjoy dignified and humble work. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":263617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T15:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Enoc ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1608.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400030,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1608.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092028,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1608.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985411,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1608.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446026,"comment":null},{"amount":80,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1608.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956665,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T14:02:44Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86630,"name":"Bintou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Bintou  S. est une femme mari\u00e9e de trente quatre (34) ans, m\u00e8re de deux (2) enfants qui vit dans une famille polygame dans la sous- pr\u00e9fecture de Selingu\u00e9.\nD\u00e8s le bas \u00e2ge elle apprit la production de la p\u00e2te d\u2019arachide aupr\u00e8s de sa m\u00e8re tr\u00e8s r\u00e9put\u00e9e et exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e en la mati\u00e8re.  \nAfin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer ses activit\u00e9s, elle int\u00e9gra le programme cr\u00e9dit de Soro Yiriwaso maintenant deux ans.

She lives with her husband and her children in a monogamous family in the village of Dialakoroba (second administrative region of the Republic of Mali). She attended school up to high school, before abandoning her studies to get married. Afterwards, she was trained in healthcare for mother and child, which enabled her to get to know medications better in order to sell them. To bolster her business, she joined the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso, from which she obtained 4 group loans (solidarity loans) and 3 individual loans. She's now seeking her fourth individual loan. All previous loans were repaid without problems.\r\nWith this loan, she intends to buy every month large quantities of pharmaceutical products in Bamako, at the governmental pharmacy, in order to resell them in the health center of her village, where she's managing the pharmacy. She foresees an average monthly profit of XOF 110'000 (ca US$ 220), to be used to repay the loan and help with the family expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":263633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To buy and resell medications","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":127803.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135774,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63901.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033575,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":63901.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620943,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":63901.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019908,"comment":null},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":63901.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242653,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":63901.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678175,"comment":null},{"amount":128.16,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":63901.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112416,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-01T16:20:45Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86639,"name":"Oumou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Oumou Tour\u00e9 est une femme mari\u00e9e de quarante sept (47) ans, m\u00e8re de quatre enfants elle vit dans une famille monogame \u00e0 S\u00e9lingu\u00e9.\nOumou fait le commerce de c\u00e9r\u00e9ales notamment celui du riz depuis des ann\u00e9es.\nElle est en relation avec l\u2019institution de microfinance de Soro Yiriwaso il y a cinq (5) ans.
