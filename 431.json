She owns a business venture planting and harvesting taro for sale and has many years of experience in this business.\r\n\r\nLematea needs a loan of WST 750 to purchase weedkillers such as Gramoxone. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or approximately USD 193 per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lematea joined SPBD and this is her 3rd loan with the organization. SPBD's loans are her only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and, since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join  SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates about

Lidia Roberta C. M. is the representative of the group. She is married and has two children, 3-year old Frida and 1-year old Beltr\u00e1n. She has a grocery store. Lidia chose this line of work because the town is very small and so there are no other businesses of this kind in the community. As well, it provides a good income.\r\nWith the loan she plans to buy more merchandise for her store such as soft drinks, soups, soap, oil, beans, rice, sugar, and salt as these are the items most in demand. \r\n\r\nLidia says that her business has greatly benefitted the people in the community as beforehand they had to go to the nearby town to buy the things they needed. Now they don\u2019t have to go as far so they save time and money.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her business so she can continue supporting her children while they get their education. They will then be able to get good jobs and have a bright future.\r\n\r\nLidia says that the people in her group are hardworking, responsible, and punctual when the time comes to make their repayments. She has known them for a long time and knows they will not try to cheat anyone who offers them help. She is grateful to the donors and to Kiva for the trust they are putting in her and the other group members. With this help they can improve their businesses as well as help their families who are very needy. \r\n\r\nThe following people belong to the Itacuan group:\r\n\r\n\u2028Lidia Roberta C.

She owns a business venture planting and harvesting bananas for sale.  Toetu has 2 years of experience in this business.  Toetu needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Toetu joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Toetu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

T. is 26 and married with 1 child.

Toetu needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Toetu joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD.

U. is 28 and married with 3 children.

Saiauta needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks & nets. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Saiauta joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Saiauta's only access to capital, because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD, and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

 V. is 20 and single with 1 child. She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community. Puaina  has 1 year of experience in this business. Puaina needs a loan of WST$1000 to buy raw ingredients for preparing cooked foods. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Puaina  joined SPBD. This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Puaina 's only access to capital, because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD, and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Three years ago, she began selling them in the city of Chiclayo.  She raises turkeys, ducks, guinea pigs, and sheep until they reach the right stage of development.  Dominga usually travels twice a week into the city in order to sell her animals.\r\n<p>\r\nDominga has worked hard to make progress and move her family forward.  With great effort and dedication, she has grown her business over time and has been able to create more demand.  She is currently requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1500 PEN so that she can invest in the purchase of more animals to raise and sell.

P. is 34 and married with 4 children.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 800 talas per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her Peola's fourth loan with SPBD.

Romano Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bemma R. is from the village of Sepac Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental. She is 31 years old. Bemma is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Shasta Daisy 1.\r\n\r\nBemma is married and has 1 infant-aged child. To make a living, Bemma owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as eggs, noodles, salt, sugar, shampoo, soap, & toothpaste in the local community. Bemma has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Bemma joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Bemma is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Bemma from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is 50 and married with 6 children.  She owns a business venture selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community.  Tagi has 4 years of experience in this business.  Tagi needs a loan of 1000 Samoan tala (WST) to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nTagi joined SPBD. This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tagi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Shasta Daisy 1.\r\n\r\nRowena is married and has three school-aged children. Rowena owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as candies, soft drinks, sardines, shampoo, soap, & toothpaste in the local community. Rowena has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 8,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rowena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Rowena's portion of the group loan is 4,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rowena from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

N. is 41 and married with 8 children.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 650 talas or US $271 per week) to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nThis is Luafulu's fourth loan with SPBD.

F. is 52 and married with 6 children.  She owns a business venture planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Pau has many years of experience in this business.  Pau needs a loan of WST$2000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 800 talas or US $333 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Pau joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Pau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Totonata needs a loan of 1000 Samoan tala (WST) to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Totonata joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Totonata's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

L. is 26 and married with 2 children (ages 1 and 5). She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community. Oso has 2 years of experience in this business. Oso needs a loan of WST$1500 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring). She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Oso  joined SPBD. This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Oso's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD, and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She is 51 years old. Merlinda is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Tundan 2.\r\n\r\nMerlinda is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Merlinda owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food, such as rice cake \"puto\", babanacue, etc. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling breads to the local community. Merlinda is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Merlinda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merlinda is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Merlinda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is 44 and married with 5 children (ages 6-25). She owns a business venture, selling local Samoan snacks such as palusami (coconut cream wrapped in taro leaves), cooked taro, yams, and soupo ese (hearty papaya soup). Tuamasaga has 3 years of experience in this business. Tuamasaga needs a loan of WST$1500 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tuamasaga joined SPBD. This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tuamasaga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD, and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

A. is 55 and married with 6 children (ages 11-28). She is starting a business venture, selling lavalavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women). Karoline needs a loan of WST$2900 to purchase additional equipment & tools such as needles & threads. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 650 talas per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Karoline joined SPBD. This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Karoline's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD, and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

L. is 46 and married with 6 children (ages 7-26).  She owns a business venture, selling puletasi (Samoan formal wear). Toreka has 4 years of experience in this business. Toreka needs a loan of WST$2900 to purchase additional fabrics & materials. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Toreka joined SPBD. This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Toreka's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD, and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 38 and married with 5 children (ages 1 - 15).  She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting taro to sell.  Sikola needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sikola joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sikola's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

F. is 55 and married with 8 children (ages 4 - 24).  She owns a business venture planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Suemalo has 4 years of experience in this business.  Suemalo needs a loan of WST$2900 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Suemalo joined SPBD.  This is her 6th loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Suemalo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 61 and married with 6 children (ages 17 - 38).  She owns a business venture, selling food products in the local community.  Fualole has 2 years of experience in this business.  Fualole needs a loan of WST$1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fualole joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fualole's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

G. is from the village of Linabu, Balingasag, Misamis Oriental. She is 39 years old. Lucia is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Lucia owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling both food & daily use products and also selling vegetables in the local community. Lucia has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lucia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Lucia is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Lucia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

I. is from the village of Jampason, Jasaan, Misamis Oriental. She is 68 years old. Felipa is married and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, Felipa owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling both food & daily use products and also retailing rice in kilo in the local community. Felipa has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 8500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Felipa joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Felipa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Felipa is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Felipa from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

A. is 45 and married with 4 children (ages 2 - 15).  She owns a business venture planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Fuarosa has 3 years of experience in this business.  Fuarosa needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fuarosa joined SPBD. This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fuarosa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nOdessa is single. To make a living, Odessa owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as soft drinks, eggs, noodles, sardines, shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Odessa has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Odessa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Odessa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from GDMPC. Odessa is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Odessa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling flowers and managing a flower farm. Ofelia has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ofelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ofelia is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Ofelia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

For the past 10 years Margarita has made a living selling flatbreads, lunches, tortillas, juices and sodas at the Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n (Sacred Heart) market, one of the biggest markets in the country's capital that sees an immense number of visitors every day. Margarita is very well known at her stand and has regular customers who eat at her business every day. She is a hard-working woman who dedicates herself to her job, making high-quality and flavorful meals that have made her so well known at her stand. It's thanks to this business that she has been able to provide for her household, since she doesn't have any other source to help out her children, who are dedicating themselves to their education. Margarita is requesting a loan so she can purchase corn, rice, cheese, beans, pork rinds, meats, vegetables, refreshments and everything else she needs to make more meals and in this way help her

She is a very responsible person who comes with very good references from the people closest to her. Celia is requesting a loan so she can have the necessary funds to purchase a larger quantity of clothing in different sizes, colors and styles, and in this way she can offer more items to more people, such as young people, adults and babies.

D. H. is 40 years old and resides in Tonacatepeque, which is located in the Department of San Salvador.  She lives with her daughter and her husband who is dedicated to his work.  From Monday to Sunday, Francisca works hard preparing tortillas since they are a basic staple of the Salvadoran diet that can be consumed up to three times a day.  Even though she has plenty of competition, her business is quite stable and attracts many customers.  Francisca and her family depend heavily on the income generated from her business, so it is very important that she improve her sales.\r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason, she is requesting a loan from Apoyo Integral.

David William is married with a family of four. He has been operating a retail shop in Ntenjeru, Kayunga where he has been selling mostly general merchandise for over three years. He has been trading in a variety of products commonly used for domestic use like sugar, soap, salt, cooking oil, paraffin and much more merchandise, earning him a profit of 70,000 Ugandan shillings per week. S. was encouraged by his brother-in-law to join the business. He began by selling agricultural produce. This hard working gentleman also earns extra profits from banana sales, milk sales and a rental business.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Rogelio has been engaged in his business for over 4 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rogelio joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rogelio has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Rogelio is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Rogelio from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

30-year-old married mother of six school-aged children, Rolina D. is from the town of Talibon where she owns and operates a business catching and then selling assorted fish to the market.

Having  repaid her previous loan from CEVI, she is requesting a new loan, her ninth, of 17000 PHP to repair their fishing boat. Rolina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and improve their living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

B. is from the village of Brgy. Bonfal East, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. He is 27 years old. Robert is married and has 2 infant-aged children. To make a living, Robert owns and operates a business venture in the services sector providing transportation services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating motorcycle transport services. Robert has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Robert joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Robert has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase tires and other accessories. Robert is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to repair existing vehicles for better service. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Robert from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of his family.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":570650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Kiva borrower is a 31-year-old Lebanese married man and has one child. He has more than 20 years of experience running a car repair shop and he is specialized in car body repair. He also supports his life income by working in car spare parts. From his business income, he was able over the years to generate enough income to cover his family's expenses. He is requesting to borrow $1,700 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase new tools for his work in addition of buying more spare parts for his business. This is his second loan from a Kiva partner and he has been reliable with his payments and paid in full several months early. And he was thankful for the loan and he is certain that the new loan will help him expand his business level even further.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.).

They live in traditional families.  They are on average 34 years old and have at least 5 children.  They mainly grow peanuts.  In order to make their agricultural businesses more profitable, the members of the group decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program 3 years ago.  After having fully paid back their previous loans, they are on their third farm loan.  Setou D., the president of the group, expects to use her loan to buy a sufficient quantity of peanut seeds, small tools and material inputs at the large market in Kimparana.  After the rainy season, the crops are stored for a certain amount of time so that they may be valued before being sold at the large market in Kimparana, M'peresso and on the surrounding markets at retail (often at wholesale) for cash to a customer base largely coming from big cities.  After the sale of their agricultural products, the members of the group each expects to make a profit of 35,000 FCFA, which will be used to repay the interest on their loans and the everyday expenses of the family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Martha Schmitz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":571499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of material inputs, seeds, and small tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sokan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Setou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nagognire ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diarratou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manssoun ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou Bougouto ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djelika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djouho ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":700000,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1400,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":708461.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360781,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-03T19:55:31Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":216285,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a married woman with five children, all attending school.

T. was born in 1966 and is married with three children. She lives in Ijevan city and, since 2007, she has been engaged in selling fruits and vegetables. Her husband and one of her sons help her in this business and, thanks to the income from the business, they have supported their family, bought necessary furniture for their home, and bought a small car for delivering fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\nNow Hasmik and her family intend to increase their business, so they need bigger vehicle for delivery.

The women live in large traditional families with their husbands, children and other relatives. They are 35 years old on average and are married with at least 3 children. \r\nThis group of women is involved in the sale of various products, such as clothes and oil, and some of them make clothes. \r\nIn order to expand their business, the group\u2019s members decided to partner with Soro Yiriwaso two years ago and are now on their fifth loan, having successfully repaid all previous ones. \r\nSanata Famanta, who is a member of the group, makes clothes for men and women. She is highly appreciated and sought-after by her customers. She aims to use her loan in order to purchase sewing and embroidery thread, needs and other materials necessary for her work.  She has her own well-equipped dressmaking studio at her home, she  purchases her goods from the Madina market and sells her wares to a varied customer base.  \r\nWhereas the other members of the group each aim to generate an average monthly profit of 180 00 FCFA, Sanata Famanta envisages generating 200 000 FCFA.    As well as repaying the loan, the women will use some of their revenue to see to their families\u2019 needs and the electricity costs associated with her business. She would like to strengthen her relationship with Soro Yiriwaso in order to purchase more sewing machines. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":571594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase sewing materials                                                                                        ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A\u00efssa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":216358,"name":"Elise","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elise is 30 years old and is married with three children who are 1, 2 and 4 years old.

The first few loans she received enabled her to support the family\u2019s fish-selling business and sewing business. The profit from these businesses has been the main source of family income. She is now requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva for a much larger amount of 27,000 PHP to purchase more fish to sell and to support the sewing business. The capital will fund further expansion of the family ventures and support her dream that her children will complete college degrees and find good jobs. Reina hopes to maintain long-term sustainable businesses. During the course of her membership in ASHI, she has been a model member dedicated to managing her family\u2019s business.  \r\n\r\nHer future goal is to purchase vehicles for her husband and expand the territory of their fish-selling business to other surrounding neighborhoods. By owning her own transportation, Reina will save time and money. With her hard work, focus, and determination, Reina is hopeful that her businesses will continue to be more productive and improve the overall standard of living of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":571598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have three children who are in primary school. Feliciano and his family live in the community of Pico Central, 68 kilometers from the city of Cochabamba, so it's difficult to go to the bank for a loan. The family makes a living in agriculture, producing potatoes, broad beans and other items on their plot of land. Feliciano's wife helps out and takes care of the livestock and the children. Feliciano is requesting the loan to purchase organic fertilizer to plant with his his potatoes, which he believes will increase his potato production by two hectares because he has some uncultivated land. This will help him save money for when his children complete their primary education, since there are only primary schools in the area where they live and all the children only have that level of education due to a lack of resources. Parents can't afford higher levels of education.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":571658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-07-23T03:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Feliciano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":317.16,"local_amount":317.16,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":317.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191401114,"comment":null},{"amount":382.84,"local_amount":382.84,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":382.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211201237,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-07-23T13:26:05Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:53:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":216394,"name":"Michael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Michael is a 44-year-old man who sells shoes to his local customers.

For over 2 years Maribel has worked making salte\u00f1as (oven-baked empanadas with meat or chicken filling), having many clients who consume her food. \r\n\r\nMaribel tells us that she needs to purchase another industrial oven to increase the number of salte\u00f1as that she makes to increase her family's earnings.

The focus of this description will be the story of Sra. Yolanda N. H., the group representative.  She is 30 years old and married to her husband Pedro.  They still do not have children.  Yolanda sells tamales, meat enchiladas, and chorizo sausage.\r\n<p>\r\nYolanda decided to pursue this business of the great demand that exists.  She only sells from home and is able to generate good earnings since she has many customers.  Yolanda has already been in business for five years and will invest her loan in the purchase of more ingredients used in making her products.  Tomatoes, chili peppers, garlic, banaN. leaves, condiments, and meat are the items that she needs the most.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith the profits from her business, Yolanda is saving toward the construction of a security wall around her house.  She also supports her husband with maintaining their household since they have many expenses between the two of them.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe says that her business is a benefit to the neighbors in her area since there are few people who sell locally. All of the vendors sell at the market, so she takes advantage of the few residents who do not like to travel to the center of town.  In addition to being close to her neighbors, she is known for the attention and service that she provides.  Do\u00f1a Yolanda dreams of adding a space to her house where she can open a butcher shop.  She also wants to have children.\r\n<p>\r\nYolanda says the members of her group are very responsible people who complete their payments on time.  They know one another and get along very well.  She is extremely grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva for their support by providing this loan.  Her business is improving as a result of this assistance.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the Cuahutemoc Group and their business activities are listed below:\r\n\u2022\tYolanda N.

D. Z. is 34 years old. She lives in the town of Soyapango, located in the San Salvador department. She lives there with her husband, who is 46 and who works as a mechanic, and with her two minor children who are in school.  Blanca has a store which is located in her house, and she also sells pupusas, which she makes every weeknight. She is asking for a loan to be financially able to diversify her business. Blanca does not have the money to do this and it is neceesary for her and her husband because the store allows them to pay for a big part of the family expenses.  She wants to diversify the store with products such as detergent, canned foods, bread, candies, beverages, and other products. These are basic home necessities and are what people ask for the most in the store. The loan will also be to buy a greater quantity of ingredients to make the pupusas, which allow her to make a little more profit. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

M. C. is 54 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture planting and harvesting bananas for sale.  Fogalua has 1 year of experience in this business.  Fogalua needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fogalua joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Fogalua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

T. K. is 32 and married with 5 children (ages 12 - 21).  She owns a business venture selling baked goods in the local community.  Punitai has many years of experience in this business. Punitai needs a loan of WST$1500 to purchase new items to expand her product offering. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to improve and expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Punitai joined SPBD. This is her second loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Punitai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD. Since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

P. is 53 years old.  She is married and has seven children.  She owns a business venture planting and harvesting taro, which she then sells.  Tufa has four years of experience in this business.  She needs a loan of WST$1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use her earnings (estimated to be 400 talas or US$167 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tufa joined SPBD.  This is her second loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tufa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii and Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her husband and two children. She says that her most difficult challenge is to travel to the USA. In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying to work.\r\n\r\nRosalia is excited to be taking her seventh loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for over four years. She started with a loan from her brother to sell food. Now she has been using Esperanza loans for 3 years. \r\n\r\nShe plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying shoes and baby clothing. She will use the profits to buy a radio, to build her house and to buy some animals to sell (she lives in a rural area so it is easy for her to raise animals like cows and pigs). Her dream is to see her children become professionals and to give them a safer and comfortable life.\r\n \r\nThis Esperanza associate began working with us because Esperanza believes in business and we want to improve our businesses. Rosalia's story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in Samana, a lush rugged peninsula with a nascent tourism industry. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and

When her husband died, she had to struggle alone to support her two children.  Since then, she has worked at various jobs and, thanks to her hard work, managed to set up a small general store, a business that she operates in her house.  She sells a variety of perishable products such as meat and vegetables.  Separately, she used some savings to buy a motocab that she has rented out and that her oldest son uses for a taxi business.  The motocab has been used so much that it is now in need of repairs.  It's for that purpose that Delia is applying for a loan.  She wants a mechanic to repair the motocab so that she can continue to use it.  She says that renting the motocab has been a difficult business because renters don't take good care of it.  She now hopes to help her family with income from her son's taxi service.  This is Delia's third MFP loan and she says that past loans have helped her to improve both her quality of life and that of her family.

For more than three years she has been growing vegetables, especially broccoli and cauliflower, since these are highly prized goods that earn good prices at the market.  For this reason, she puts the effort into planting these crops.  Her husband and children are always monitoring each step that is required to grow each product, from planting through harvest.  She hires workers for the final process which involves collecting everything that is ready for harvest.  Once everything is collected Edita sells her products directly at the local market, but she also takes them to other cities nearby to expand her customer base.  During the whole time she has been farming, Edita has seen improvements in her finances because her profits have been good and her land has maintained its fertility season after season.  In order to keep improving her crops, she wants to expand by acquiring more land.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP.

Its main economic activities are stockbreeding and agriculture, notably the sowing of basic grains, tubers and oranges.\r\n\r\nAlejandro and his family have always engaged in cattle farming making the most of both the meat and the milk productions.

She lives with her husband and 3 children in her own home. Since she was a child Clorinda has worked in agriculture, and this is her main source of earnings. Each day her family watches over the cultivated land, looking after the crops, applying fertiliser, watering them, trying to ensure that the plagues of insects don't damage the plants and affect the crop. Although agricultural work is hard, Clorinda affirms that she likes the work a lot because it allows her to be free to feed her family. Vegetable cultivation is the most profitable, producing a large quantity of products that get a good price in the local market in the zone. In the future Clorinda wants to acquire more land where she can continue to produce more. This is her tenth loan with MFP and she is very content to know that she has financial support. She has always been responsible with her repayments, and is thankful to be part of a communal bank as all the members are responsible and supportive people. Clorinda is thankful that the members will be guarantors for the loan she is seeking, as it will be very useful for her business. With the loan she is seeking Clorinda plans to invest in the purchase of seeds and compost (prepared earth) to add to her land and in this way improve her potato and vegetable crops. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":571887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase seeds and compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-06T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clorinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":151.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":154.47},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":161.66},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":176.53},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":185.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.99},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.93},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.2},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":114.92,"local_amount":306.45,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":324.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887428,"comment":null},{"amount":60.62,"local_amount":161.66,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":171.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154431,"comment":null},{"amount":63.75,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":179.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449740,"comment":null},{"amount":66.2,"local_amount":176.53,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":186.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588443,"comment":null},{"amount":69.51,"local_amount":185.36,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":196.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724946,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-07T09:30:06Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":216525,"name":"Luis Alberto","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luis Alberto A.

They named themselves after the village where their group is located.  The majority of them are natives of this village.  This story is about Ver\u00f3nica T. D. as she is the group representative.  She is married and has 3 children, Paola, who is 9 years old and is in elementary school, Ingrid, 3, and a baby who is 5 months old.  Ver\u00f3nica sells traditional street snacks.  \r\n\r\nShe tells us that she started this business because in the village where she lives there isn't anyone who sells food in the afternoons and she likes to prepare food.  She will use the loan that she is requesting to buy supplies like oil, salt, tomatoes, napkins, plates, utensils and chilies to prepare her dishes.   \r\n\r\nShe provides for her children with the earnings from the business and helps her husband with the household expenses and the education of their children.  \r\n\r\nShe says that her business is beneficial to her community as well, since she is the only person that sells prepared food here.   Now, the people that don't have time or the desire to prepare food, can buy her food.   \r\n\r\nHer goal is to give her children a quality education so that they can have a good profession and a better future.  She also wants to set up a permanent local so that she can generate more income.  \r\n\r\nShe tells us that all the other members in the group are responsible people that fulfill their obligations.  They like to work to overcome and excel given any difficulty.  Since they have known each other for a long time, they are committed to repaying their loan.   They do not want to let down those that have put their trust in them.  \r\n\r\nOn behalf of her and her daughter, Ver\u00f3nica would like to thank FRAC and Kiva because, thanks to them, she could change her life and that of her children since they will have a better education.  \r\n\r\nThe members of Tetepelcingo and what each one does for a living are as follows: \r\nVer\u00f3nica T.
