She would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. Katumu has already received and successfully repaid four loans, and now requires a new loan in order to buy additional cooking condiments. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 260,000 SLL. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Katumu plans to own a shop and to be a supplier of cooking condiments and to educate her children to the university level. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1056624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To pay for cooking condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Bo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-03-30T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-29T19:30:04Z","loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katumu","last_name":"Musa","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":409112,"name":"Laban","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Laban is an ICT specialist living in Mombasa, Kenya.

The business was launched with a sum of 30,000 som (KGS), and thanks to Abibakhan's dedicated work now makes 12,000 som (KGS) per month. In order to continue expanding her farm, Abibakhan has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 130,000 som (KGS) to buy two dairy cows, some sheep and animal feed.

She works as a manager of a milk farm in the Petrovka village.  Having worked in the agricultural field for ten years, Zoya has knowledge and experience in breeding livestock.  Every year, the milk farm migrates to pastures in the mountains during the summer period, where Zoya moves too with the farm's employees.  Today, Zoya's business contains 3 heads of purebred dairy cows and 15 heads of sheep.  Sales of milk and milk products yield about 25,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further develop her business, Zoya requested a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy a purebred dairy cow.  She plans to invest the earnings from the loan into a purchase of technology to improve her farm's functions.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1061309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Petrovka village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-03-30T22:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-29T22:50:05Z","loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zoya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":428.57},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1071.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":410300,"name":"Lavenie De Ferrier 2, 4 & 6 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Belius est le coordinateur de son groupe Lavenie de Ferrier 2, 4 & 6.

However, it was suffering from gradual wear and tear due to being used so much and Everisto gave it away.  After a few years, with much effort, he put his money together again and was able to purchase a new vehicle with which he is currently working.\r\n\r\nEvaristo works very hard every day because his children, ages 12 and 16, need a lot from him.  His goal is to improve the lives of his partner and his children so that they can grow up healthy and have everything they need.\r\n\r\nWith the help that is being provided to him, Evaristo will be able to purchase some tools that are necessary to provide his vehicle with required maintenance.  Over these long eighteen years, he has learned how to make some repairs to his vehicle.  This purchase will allow him to generate higher income for his household because his vehicle will be in better condition.  In addition, he will be able to purchase tires and perform needed maintenance on his engine.\r\n\r\nHe is very grateful for the support that is being offered to him because he will be able to earn higher income and will not be concerned if the vehicle suffered some damage in the course of his daily work.  Evaristo wants his children to receive appropriate education and become successful professionals.  \r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1054657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"to purchase tools, tires, and maintain his engine.

The majority of men in the community make a living by harvesting corn.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is se\u00f1ora \u00c1gueda, who is 31.  She has sold chickens and fish for 3 years.  What she likes most about her job is plucking the chickens and cleaning the fish.  She tells us that she goes out to sell them to the houses in the community in the mornings and afternoons.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that she is a widow and has 5 children:  Aurelio, Jose, Maria, Liliana, and Isabel, who are her biggest treasures.  They are her inspiration and strength for getting ahead.  One of her dreams is to give her children a better future.\r\n\r\nShe asked for the loan to buy more chickens and fish to sell wholesale and retail.  She tells us that selling chickens is the most profitable because it's what her compatriots like a lot.\r\n\r\nShe tells us about one of her experiences:  what she first started to sell was chickens, she bought them little by little and went out to sell them to houses.  With her profits, she bought fish and stopped selling chickens.  But thanks to the support of the foundation, she bought more chickens and fish to sell.  Selling fish also makes good profits for her, but not more than the chickens.  She tells us that she is happy to have two businesses since these profits help her children with their education.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to the foundation for helping good and indigenous people.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nCarmelita \u2013 who sells beef\r\nPablo - who sells beef\r\nJulia - who sells chicken\r\nMargarita - who sells embroidered clothing\r\nAlicia - who sells bread\r\nSonia - who sells bricks\r\nMarcelino - who sells Mexican comfort food\r\nEdith - who sells bricks.\r\n\r\nShe is thankful to the foundation for helping good people who have the desire to improve themselves, get ahead, and fulfill their dreams.  Common and poor people also have hopes and dreams."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1054988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy chickens and fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"santiaguito jicayan","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-03-31T01:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-30T01:10:02Z","loan_amount":7000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmelita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agueda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricelino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":89000,"loan_amount":7000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":16143.85},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":17027.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":17728.59},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":18634.28},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":19465.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1269.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1339.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1394.39},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1465.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1531.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":409482,"name":"Zainabu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zainabu is a married woman with four children, all of whom graduated from school.

She is married to Carlito, a contractor. Along with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCelma operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals in the evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. She also sells ready-to-wear clothing for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Celma is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nCelma hopes to grow her business and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through her hard work on her business.
