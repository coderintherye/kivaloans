She only works 4 hours daily since she has colon problems and a heart murmur and those keeps her from working longer. Her advantage is that the products she sells move quickly since women always like to look nice. A disadvantage is that she sells on credit and sometimes her customers don't pay on time. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a few employees to expand her sales territory and increase her income. She is requesting a loan to buy perfumes, creams, shampoos, conditioners, lipsticks, eye shadow, mascara, deodorants, etc, since this time of year her suppliers have great deals and she wants to take advantage of them. \r\n\r\nShe has had several loans with FAMA and is very thankful for the support since her business has allowed her to meet her basic needs.

With this kind of upbeat optimism, no one can go wrong in any aspect of life.  \r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of business, Lillian has, in the course of time, been brought to terms with the fact that this pays dividends.

All of her children had to leave their education early due to the poor financial condition of Shamim and her husband. Her elder son works in a factory, while the second one works in a gas station. Her husband has a small piece of land where he grows different crops. Shamim helps her husband financially by selling milk from her buffalo and she has a good client base because of the pure quality of the milk she sells. She has been working at this business for over 10 years; her earnings allow her to pay for the basic needs of her family. Shamim wants to buy another buffalo to fulfill the demand for milk from her clients, which is why she has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah. She is hopeful that this investment will provide her with a  good profit. This is her 2nd loan application from Asasah.

He has been operating this business for the last 10 years, and Surriaya is very confident that her son will be able to expand his business with the help of this loan. Notably, she is a regular client of Asasah, and this would be her third loan through Asasah. With respect to her prior loans, she responsibly paid her installments and attended every meeting.

In the future, Goma plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  \r\n\r\nThe purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  This loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering micro-credit and business training programs to low-income women.

She wanted to sell something, but wasn\u2019t sure what.  By observing her nieces, who were always buying accessories such as pins, belts and barrettes, she got the idea to start selling these types of products.  She first started selling to her acquaintances, offering all types of accessories for young girls.  She also devised the idea to copy styles out of catalogs, and sell them at lower prices.  With a great deal of hard work, she was able to strengthen her business.  She now has a large customer base, and this has allowed her to buy some items that she needed for her house.  \r\n\r\nHowever, she considers educating her children to be of utmost importance.  She is now thinking about making pet\u2019s clothing, since another passion of hers is knitting.  She makes ponchos, scarves, and swimsuits.  Not long ago she knitted some samples that were taken to the U.S. by a relative, and she is now receiving orders for some of her items.  For this reason, she is thinking about starting this type of new business.  She plans to use the loan from EDAPROSPO to buy thread so she can dedicate herself to this business that she is just starting, and knows she has a bright future ahead.\r\n\r\n* Carmen is in the middle of the group.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":626477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase thread to make pet's clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-10-26T20:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Jhonatan Johan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Casilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Kathy Mayra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guiullianna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Frank Aron","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2450,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":613},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":613},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":613},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":611}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.18},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.18},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225.18,"local_amount":613,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":627.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529224,"comment":null},{"amount":225.19,"local_amount":613,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:24Z","rounded_local_amount":627.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665332,"comment":null},{"amount":225.18,"local_amount":613,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":627.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408575,"comment":null},{"amount":224.45,"local_amount":611,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":625.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826867,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-10-27T19:56:26Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":242241,"name":"Chrouk","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chrouk N., age 41, and her husband, Hout Yan, age 61, earn a living by planting various crops on their own farmland.

She lives in the area called Mughalpura with her family in a two-room brick house. She moved here five years ago. \r\n\r\nA very talented lady, Naseem owns and operates a clothes sewing business at her home. The sewing business is a very demanding business in Lahore because Lahore is also famous for its new fashion trends. She mainly gets orders from her neighborhood clients. She offers them quality services, which gives her a good return in the form of money.\r\n  \r\nHer husband sells shawls (a kind of cloth worn over shoulders and body). He has a small shop in the market where he specifically sells these shawls. He sells different kinds of shawls, such as embroidered, simple and colorful. He imports the shawls from Multan city at cheap rates and sells them through his shop for a good profit.  \r\n\r\nNaseem is the mother of six children. Her eldest son is a rickshaw driver and the one next to him is a property dealer. The last four children are enrolled in a school and are getting their education. \r\n\r\nNaseem has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. He will buy shawls with the loan amount. He has been doing this business for over seven years and Naseem is hopeful that the loan will bring positive changes to his business. \r\n \r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her second loan application. In the previous loan year, she built a good credit record and never missed any meetings.\r\n  \r\nNote: In the photo, the lady who is raising her hand is Naseem.

has a mixed farm that produces milk and vegetables, which she sells to the local market. She has been farming for 14 years in Eldoret town, Rift Valley, Kenya, and employs two farmhands. She also earns income from the sale of eggs and chickens to the local market. Her primary challenges are fluctuations in the prices of milk, lack of enough animal feeds, insufficient water and a poor transport network.\r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan of 70,000 Kenyan shillings through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a water tank. She says that for a long time, her problem has been insufficient water. This water tank will solve her water problem and she is confident that her dairy cows will produce milk evenly.\r\n\r\nSarah is currently running modernized dairy keeping (zero grazing or stall feeding the animals). She hopes to purchase a milking machine and a tractor that will be used to process animal feeds in the future.\r\n\r\nSarah is 36 years old. She is married with three school-aged children, all of whom attend

Community Group 2-Kampala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Being undecided and lacking foresight in whatever you do in life is similar to a deer getting caught in the headlights -- your fate may hang in such an unpredictable balance that you may end up failing in whatever you do.\r\n\r\nBeing a product of a hardworking community, 37-year-old Hassan M. has steered clear of such a predicament. People in his community in Naluvule, Kampala, are well known sticklers fpr hard work and have always risen to the occasion when opportunities arise. \r\n\r\nIt has been 12 years since this gentleman decided to start his retail shop. He sells a variety of general merchandise retail items that are in high favor with the people around his locality. He earns 180,000 shillings in weekly profit.

She is divorced and lives with her 3 grandchildren. All three go to school. She completed 2nd grade in an adult literacy program but didn't continue because she changed homes. She lives in her own home with her grandchildren and doesn't support anyone else.\r\n\r\nShe left Namaacha to Boane when she moved in with her husband. She has had her own business for more than eight years. She doesn't have any employees and has an income of around 2,500 meticais per month. She spends it in household expenses and saves some every now and then in her own home. \r\n\r\nShe has never had loans with other banks. She became familiar with Hluvuku through a friend who is also a partner of the institution. This loan, in the amount of 10,000 meticais, is her fifth. She intends to buy construction materials (cement, beams, zinc screens, stone, iron and others) to continue construction of her house. The previous loans were for 3,500, 5,200, 6,000 and 8,000 meticais, all used for housing. \r\n\r\nShe is confident she will pay ahead of schedule and request another loan to finish her home and offer

She is very good at her art and receives orders regularly. \r\n\r\nHer husband is blacksmith.  He makes iron rods and sells them through his shop.  He also supplies iron rods to different building constructors. He is an expert in his work and due to his quality work, people who come to buy iron rods from him become his permanent customers.  \r\n\r\nShagufta\u2019s eldest son lives in Dubai and works there as a computer operator.  Her two younger children are getting their education studying in college. \r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband\u2019s business. He will utilize the loan money to purchase iron in larger quantities to make more iron rods for completing his customers' orders.  Shagufta is hopeful that this investment will be a profitable experience for her husband\u2019s business. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her third loan application. In previous loan years, she had responsibly paid her installments on time and attended every meeting. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, Shagufta is the lady who is raising her

He is married and the father of 5 children. Most of the children are grown, only the two youngest go to school. He went to school until 6th grade and didn't continue because at that time it was very hard to go to college. He lives in his own home with his family and doesn't support anyone else. \r\n\r\nHe left Matutuine to go to Boane due to the civil war. He has been working as a driver's assistant at a public transportation company for more than four years. He has a monthly salary of 3,000 meticais. He spends it in household expenses and saves some in his savings account. \r\n\r\nHe has never had loans from other banks. He became familiar with Hluvuku through a friend who is also a partner of the institution. This loan, in the amount of 12,000 meticais, is his third. He intends to buy construction materials (cement, beams, zinc screens and others) to continue construction of his home. The previous loans were for 6,000 and 12,000 meticais and were all used for housing expenses. \r\n\r\nHe is confident that he will pay ahead of time and request another loan to finish his home and

is a married woman with three children all of whom attend school.

O. is forty one years old and married. His wife is a business lady and they have five children, between the ages of 4 and 15 years. Stanslaus and his wife would like to provide a quality education for each of his children to the university level. His business is located at Kibera and he is served by the Kitengela branch. He sells charcoal to the local people. He has been in this business for ten years now and has one employee. He says that the business is profitable. He says that his major challenge is financial constraints. However, he works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep his business doing well.

To this end, she joined Kiva partner, ASHI, and felt very happy to be given the chance to access working capital. The first few loans she received enabled her to operate her bamboo furniture making business. The profit from this business has been the main source of family income. Now that she and her husband Mamerto, have secured access to capital, her profits have improved. For that reason, she is now requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva for a much larger amount. Specifically the loan fund will be used for buying raw materials needed for her business.  This will enable her to grow their business further so that they will have savings in the future. Her long term dreams are to continue supporting her children as well as building a stronger home that can withstand flooding common in her province. \r\n\r\nA dedicated member of ASHI since 2007, Rhodora has been a model member demonstrating regular attendance at weekly meetings and timely repayments on loans. Since joining ASHI, she has gained more self-confidence as a businesswoman and entrepreneur managing her own

She sells fish and seafood, both fresh and dried. She has her stand on a street named Avenida D. Comercio in San Francisco Gotera. She is married and she lives together with her husband and their three children: Mario Francisco, 22 years old; Douglas Armando, 17 years old; and, Carlos Daniel, 14 years old. \r\n\r\nShe started out with her sister as a business partner but now she works only with her family.  She purchases the fresh fish in the very early morning hours in San Miguel and by 8am she is ready to start selling in Gotera. She has more than 20 years' experience in the business and it has been her only source of income used to support and educate her children. \r\n\r\nShe requests a loan to revitalize her seafood business and now especially that the day of the dead approaches and many people buy flowers, she wants to take advantage of the season and sell in this time. She plans to invest 50% of the funds on each one of her two businesses. This investment will help her generate more earnings to be used to supplement the family economy. The only risk has to sell the fresh seafood quickly to avoid losing freshness over several days. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to garner enough profit to send her kids to school, to help them have a career. She will also use her profits to repay this loan, and to save money enough to build her own home one day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":626890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase

She is a widow and lives with her two grown-up daughters who have their own families.  For 18 years she has been selling milk for a living.  The milk comes from her own cow which she reared.  Every day she heads to a family member's stable where she looks after her cow.  Very early in the morning she milks her cow and obtains fresh milk which is then sold to her customers who are dairy product salesmen.  In addition to selling milk, she processes it into yoghurt and cheese.  She also sells 'mazamorra' (a Peruvian dessert) in an itinerant manner which provides daily income for her home.  She enjoys her work a lot, she already has several years' experience and now her great desire is to have more cows.  This is her 13th loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support.  She states that she likes being part of her community bank because all its members are people that she knows.  They are all responsible and very supportive.  She also thanks all those who will help fund the loan that she is requesting as it will be very useful for her business' progress.
