She is 55 years old. Walita is married and has 5 adult-aged children.\r\n<p>\r\nTo make a living, Walita owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling \"banana cue\" food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling  banana snack to the local community. Walita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Walita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Walita is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Walita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":389069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

B. is from the village of Sto. Ni\u00f1o, Tukuran, Zamboanga del sur. She is 26 years old. Leonisa is married and has 3 infant-aged children. \r\n<p>\r\nTo make a living, Leonisa owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a \"sari-sari\" or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste etc. in the local community. Leonisa has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Leonisa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Leonisa is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Leonisa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her  family. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":388418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sto.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History <p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History <p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M. is a young woman of 18.  She lives with her parents and two brothers in an area called San Francisco de la Palmera which is located in San Carlos in the province of Alajuela.  This rural community has a lot of potential for development because in addition to agricultural work they have been able to develop community services like fattening cattle and small businesses opportunities. \r\n\r\nMarianela had to drop out of school a short while ago for economic reasons, but says that would like to start her own business thanks to the help she is receiving from her family.  Her efforts and perseverance are what helped her get into aviculture.  Bit by bit, she has been able to create a space on her patio to raise chickens and laying hens to sell to her neighbors, who are very happy with the quality.\r\n\r\nToday, Marianela is asking for a micro-loan of 300,000 colons to purchase more chickens and hens.  She would also like to buy animal feed and products to prevent and treat illnesses and expand her space.  Marianela  would like to grow her business with this loan, be able to take care of her customers, and provide better service.  All of this will help her improve her living conditions and in this way she will be able to continue her education and achieve her goals.\r\n\r\nMarianela is a member of the communal bank \u201cSan Francisco de la Palmera\u201d which is one of hundreds of EDESA\u2019s member institutions in Costa Rica.

That\u2019s why Adriana is always paying attention to the prices of corn, wheat, and potatoes\u2014because according to this her earnings will be of greater benefit to her entire family.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the third opportunity she has for a loan with MFP.  Obtaining these loans has taught her to be more responsible with her accounts and now she is sure to make her payments with punctuality.

A. is 60 years old, and lives with her mother in a small rural community in Costa Rica called Cuatro Bocas de Upala, in the province of Alajuela.  There they are developing many activities such as trade, stockbreeding for two purposes (meat and milk), and agriculture.\r\n<p>\r\nFor quite some time, Vilma has been taking care of her mother.  She says that when she was younger, she could go to work outside of the house, but with the passing of the years, her mother\u00b4s health has been deteriorating, which made Vilma leave her job.  But she has always worked very hard, and she has taken back up a project that she had years before.  Now Vilma works in the Teca plantation.  Teca is a lush tree that has the capacity to not be damaged when it comes into contact with metals.  Its wood is very resistant to water, which makes it very valuable for making furniture and boats.  \r\n<p>\r\nNow Vilma wants to obtain a loan for 650 colons, in order to do maintenance in her plantation, and also to buy fertilizers, and to pay for other necessary inputs to keep it in a good state.  \r\n<p>\r\nVilma is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Bansuperafe; which is only made up of women, and specializes in supporting non-professional women and female heads of households.  It is one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her third loan, and with it, she hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level, as well as actively participate in the loan organization in her community.<br

His business consists of buying and selling livestock. He makes his purchases in communities because it is here where he will be the most successful in providing for his family. Funding has always been used to invest in his business. He got his start when his father taught him this trade when he was 7-years-old and gave him a calf. Bit by bit Antonio managed to buy cows, bulls, and calves and to have his own business. The most difficult part is that he didn\u2019t have enough animals but with the financing he was able to move forward. He is currently seeking more funding so he can purchase more livestock. He desires to expand his business so he can be successful.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Sindewald, Kiva

The members' expectations are to have a productive business that will give their families a higher quality of life and give their children a better education. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy Schapiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":390298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Nela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Percy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carola  Giovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eddy Janeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":31500,"loan_amount":4525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2462.98},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2491.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2519.99},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2548.99},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2578.32},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2607.99},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2638},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2668.35},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2699.06},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2730.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2761.53},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2793.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":353.81},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.88},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.16},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":374.64},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.95},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":383.31},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.72},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":392.19},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":396.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":137880,"name":"Dios Es Amor 4 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juana is the group coordinator of the group Dios es Amor (God is Love).

After having successfully repaid her first loan, Juana is taking another loan to purchase more clothing, hair accessories, and ice cream to sell to her clients.

He can only afford to purchase a little at a time. He is proud to have purchased his smoker, his biggest purchase so far, with his own savings. \r\n\r\nJames needs a loan to help him purchase a mobile food cart. He plans to sell his tamales and meats in California parks, so people will know where to find him and his products. In the future, James hopes to have his own kitchen so that he can expand his business to its full potential, including a staff of two employees. \r\n\r\nJames is excited about working wtih Opportunity Fund, not only for the chance of getting a loan to buy the cart, but also for teaching him important business skills to help him run and expand his business effectively.

Its 12 members are very close and dynamic where it concerns group activities.  As a general rule, group members engage in different activities. Ms. Maria Elena, for instance, sells groceries in her neighborhood store and is able to support her three children with the business. Other members sell newspapers, detergents, cosmetics through catalogues and underwear, still others proviD. services in hardware, food, manicure, housecleaning and laundry. There is currently a lot of competition. The important thing, though, is that group members have regular customers who trust them and their services as they always fulfill their orders. Competition in sales is stiff, but the group\u2019s businesses are very profitable, though they require hard work, evidence of which is the fact that members work seven days a week. They are able to proviD. food and education for their families thanks to their hard work. The loan is to be used to add new product lines, to invest in fabric in wholesale quantities, to buy merchandise more in tune with current needs and to buy supplies to increase manufacture and improve on their products.  Even though this is the first loan the group requests, some individual members have previously participated with other communal groups. They already know how to manage loans and understand fully that by meeting their obligations they will be able to continue to grow and enjoy the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Montserrat Zuckerman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":390353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Deysi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Pura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23500,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1837.47},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1858.61},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1880},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1901.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1923.51},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1945.65},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1968.04},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1990.68},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2013.59},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2036.76},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2060.19},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":263.89},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":266.93},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":273.11},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":276.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":282.65},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.19},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":292.51},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.88},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":137898,"name":"Yanapasi\u00f1ani Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u201dYanapasi\u00f1ani\u201d en lengua aymar\u00e1 significa \u201c Ayud\u00e9monos entre nosotros\u201d, es la denominaci\u00f3n que adoptan diecis\u00e9is mujeres, que trabajan hace siete a\u00f1os junto a Pro-Mujer.

Even though she is self-employed, she did not have much sales experience and used this business as an opportunity to learn these skills.  She quickly discovered that it was not so difficult and was able to overcome her shyness.  Now she absolutely loves what she does.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used as operating capital to purchase necessary products such as candy, natural beverages, bread, cookies, and basic grains.\r\n<br

She lives with her mother, whom she loves very much. They both work very hard to get ahead in life. Ruth\u2019s snack shop is located in one of the city of Juliaca\u2019s most important public transportation stations. Her business is much frequented because the drivers always stop by to eat something in between every trip. Her stand is where the majority of passengers purchase something to eat for the road. What Ruth most likes about her job is attending to her customers and conversing with them. She has been in business for 5 years. What she thinks is the most difficult aspect of her job is having to stay in her kiosk all day long, without being able to take a walk around her city. In the future, she would like to have a big grocery store where she can sell her products with greater comfort. <p>\r\nThis is Ruth\u2019s sixth loan with MFP. Just like she did with her previous loans, she intends to make her payments on time because she knows that if she doesn\u2019t, she will cause problems in her communal bank, where she is respected for being so responsible. With this 1,000.00 PEN loan, she will purchase more snacks to restock her kiosk and in so doing offer her customers a greater selection.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":390542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":169.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997545,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":169.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842893,"comment":null},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":169.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842894,"comment":null},{"amount":174.65,"local_amount":499,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":506.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734469,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

H\u00e0 is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Nghi\u00eam X\u00e1 14 (14).\n\n\nH\u00e0 is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, H\u00e0 owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale.  H\u00e0 has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately 2.500.000 VND a month from these activities.\n\n\nIn 2007, H\u00e0 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H\u00e0 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.256.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.048.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  H\u00e0 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of the borrower's family.\n\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n\n1.  Nghi\u00eam Th\u1ecb H. (20201020049) is a 26 year-old female who is requesting a 5.600.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\n\n\n2.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nH\u00e0 Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb (20201020048) l\u00e0 27 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

has been selling vegetables and cooked food snacks in her village for many years. She sells her own harvested vegetables by going house-to-house. Sometimes, she also buys additional vegetables from the market to sell to have a bigger income. Most of the time, her income is being used to support the needs of her family. Rosalinda would like to ask for financial assistance from Kiva lenders. She would be very thankful if she could borrow 4,000 PHP. She hopes that her request will be approved because her business is the only source of income that can help her family cope with their poor living situation. \r\n<p>\r\nRosalinda is 45 years old. She is a very patient businesswoman in their village in the district Saranay of Barangay Flores Naguilian, Isabela. She is married to a farmer, Ricardo M., who is 48 years old. They have four children: three are already grown up and finished their studies up to secondary school only. Their youngest is just four years old and not yet in school.

N. is 47 years old and a mother of nine children - of which, two are in high school, one is in grade school and the rest are grown. She is married to Reynaldo N., a 52 year-old farmer. Daisy, together with her husband, work hard to earn and provide for the future of her children. The family lives in the village of Sto. Cagay, Brgy. Su-ay, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\n<p>Daisy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1991 and testifies that it was through NWTF-Project Dungganon that she has achieved some of her dreams - to be able to send her children to school, have her own business to supplement the income that her husband earns as a farmer, and to have some savings for the future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>She started her business by selling fruits (bananas, etc.), which were delivered by a wholesaler, to their neighbors from a stand set up outside her house. Later, she expanded her product offerings, including groceries and other commodities. Additionally, she raised pigs in her backyard. Her business activities earned about PHP 8,000 per month, which was significant in helping to improve her family's quality of life.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her previous 8th cycle loan amounting to PHP 14,000. She paid back the loan in full and on-time without any delays in any of the weekly installments. She is now borrowing PHP 16,000 for her 9th cycle loan. She plans to use the money as revolving capital to offer more products in her \"sari-sari\", also known as a \"general store\". She intends to use the profits from this loan cycle to pay for her children's tuition and to provide them with their daily allowance.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:<\/p>\r\n<p>In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":390610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

in a sugarcane plantation, locally known as a \"hacienda\", and earning a living as a hacienda worker is hard because you need to wake up very early around 4:30 AM to perform backbreaking work for very low wages with very little benefits. What's worse, the work is seasonal - usually work is available only from October to April, and then when sugar milling season starts, from May to September, work in the hacienda is intermittent at best.\r\n\r\n<p>This was the experience of Nancy F., a 38 year-old, who is married to Berdandin F., a 46 year-old. A few years back, Berdandin stopped working in the hacienda and started selling ice buko (frozen young coconut meat and juice) around their community because it earned more income than working for a daily wage in the sugar cane fields.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing how much income her husband earned selling ice buko, Nancy joined in the efforts. She soon had many loyal customers in the local school, market and nearby villages. As demand for her product grew, Nancy's business became limited by her working capital. This made her decide to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 so that she could access the microcredit line, so that she could increase her selling capacity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans she received from NWTF-Project Dungganon helped her to increase their income capacity. In addition to her ice buko business, Nancy also saw the opportunity to earn additional income by selling rice to her neighbors in the hacienda and neighboring villages. Later, she also bought a motorcycle, on installment, for her husband to provide transportation services. The vehicle is called \"habal-habal\"; it is a single motorcycle that can carry multiple passengers at a time, although it could be hired on a per trip basis to carry only one or two passengers or a load of goods. The motorcycle will be fully-paid in a few months time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nancy is happy with how her life is going. Her only child, who is now 17 years old is attending college and has a bright future. Her family's quality of life has greatly improved from the poverty that they previously experienced; all because they worked hard and concerted all their efforts towards the goal of moving out of poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:<\/p>\r\n<p>In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

Rahima sells sweets, preserved food, juices, soft drinks, detergents and other products in her grocery. She is 33 years old, widowed and has two children. Rahima has been running the grocery store for the past five years. The inventory she has for sale is of very good quality and selection. Rahima is respectful and patient with all of her customers, which attracts people and brings them back to her store to buy groceries again. Rahima is trying to sustain her business and has requested a loan of $800 US to increase the inventory she has for sale. We believe this current loan will enhance the potential of her business and help Rahima reach all of her aspirations.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Some engage in businesses and in agriculture, while others organize extra classes for the pupils (though this is a practice the government is trying to abolish). \r\n\r\nThese teachers seek a loan in order to embark on meaningful projects, such buying of a plot of land, starting\/completing the building of a house, paying school fees for either their children or for themselves to pursue further studies, buying furniture, etc. Gradually, out of their monthly salaries, they will repay their SMT\/Kiva loan.\r\n\r\nAndrew (third from right) is a senior teacher at the school and head of this group.

Nuriddin was born in 1965 and is married with three children. As an aspiring and hard-working man he has always dreamed of achieving success in whatever he does. Thus, when he joined IMON International last year, he was able to make much progress with his previous loan, which he invested mostly in crop farming. Then, he saw a new business opportunity: rearing of the young cattle, which is very profitable because of the constant demand for meat at the market. Given this loan, Nuriddin will purchase young cattle and feeding for them to expand his business. He plans to use the profits from his business to educate his children, improve the structure of his home, and improve the standard of living of his family.    \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and was once ruled by Alexander the Great. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Nematillo has raised cattle and farmed for 19 years. With two children and the responsibility of providing food for his home has been able to improve his family\u2019s financial situation thanks to the excellent care that he has given his animals. Today Nematillo finds himself in need of purchasing calves to raise in order to be able to take greatest advantage of raising and selling them when necessary. For this reason Nematillo is obtaining loan from IMON International in order to obtain these animals and raise them so that in time they can be used to support his family.   \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Palaka Norte, in the town of Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. She's reaching for her dreams through hard work, patience, self-discipline, and the determination to move away from poverty. As a young girl, she dreamed of having her own business someday.\r\n<P>\r\nRutchell grew up going from town to town with her parents selling dried fish during the town market day. She learned how to deal with customers, how to sell, and how to handle money from her parents. When she got married, she decided to put up her own dried fish vending business. With the help of her husband and a little capital, they started selling dried fish in their community.<P>\r\n\r\nNeeding more capital to expand her business moved Rutchel to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997. With more capital available, she was able to start going to different towns during their market day, exponentially increasing her income. After her 3rd cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rutchell decided to further supplement her family's income potential by opening a general store as an additional source of income. Over the next 10 years, her business provided well for her young family, and she now earns on an average PHP 16,400 per month, which is used to pay for the education of her 4 children, cover the family's household expenses, and set aside some savings for the future of her children.\r\n<P>\r\nRutchell has been an NWTF-Project Dungganon member in good standing for the last 12 years and her last loan of PHP 29,500 was paid in full with no delays in weekly installments. For this 17th loan, Rutchell is again borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use as revolving working capital for her dried fish business and the general store. The profits from this loan will continue to fund the education of her children and provide for the family's household expenses.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: <P>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":390508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Emmanuel also cares for 2 brothers. He lives and sells on Lynch Street, downtown Monrovia, Liberia. This community was destroyed by the civil war, so people live in old and burnt houses.\r\n\r\n Emmanuel\u2019s business is brick making. He molds bricks and sells them retail to those that are into renovation, since Lynch street was destroyed by the civil war. \r\n\r\nAfter making bricks during the daytime, Emmanuel\u2019s night business is operating his little tea shop. He also serves as a photographer to the residents of Lynch Street. Emmanuel started as a brick contractor and raised some money which he used to start up his own business and he has been working at this business for 9 years. He always has goods on hand and sells at an affordable price, so him has a lot of customers.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel\u2019s main difficulty is during the rainy season when the rain damages his bricks because he does not have a shelter. Emmanuel needs this loan to purchase more cement in order to produce more bricks that can serve his customers and also to build a shelter to work under and that can also protect his bricks. He hopes to have a big business, if possible a company in the future.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel dreams of having access to funds that can help other people through his business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":390741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"to

Josefina Binilla E., 43, lives there.  She has been a widow since her husband died a year and a half ago.  She has two children who live with her.  Both of them go to school.  Her daughter is taking an advanced hairstyling course.  Her son goes to kindergarten.\r\n\r\nJosefina has a grocery store called \u201cAbarrotes Dona Jose\u201d.  She has been serving people for nine years.  She had the idea to set up a store with her husband.  They had some money saved, and they saw that there weren\u2019t any stores on the street.  The others were very out-of-the-way.  She started her business with a small table with very few groceries.  Little by little, it was growing into what it is now.  Her store is located on the main street in Jantetelco, the Avenida Lopez A. No.1.  Due to its good location and excellent service, many customers, from her village or others, come to her store every day.\r\n\r\nJosefina is asking for a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to buy sugar, bread, grain, oil, milk, eggs, potatoes (chips), canned goods, toilet paper, jugs of water, soft drinks, bottled water, and soaps, etc.  In the future she hopes to make her store larger and to set up a stand where she sells fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nShe found out about FRAC from a friend who invited her to be part of a group.  However, several months ago she had an operation and could not continue with FRAC.  Now that she has recovered, she returns to ask for a loan to restock her store and have more products to offer her customers.  Her group is called Avenida Lopez A., and it is comprised of 12 women.\r\n\r\nTranquilina F. Pi\u00f1a, La Sra. Angela C. Hern\u00e1ndez, Francisca A. B., Marta R. L., Eustolia A. R., Amada M.

Florencia Marta sells cloths in the street markets of the communities in the outskirts of her village.  Maria Eulalia R. Jim\u00e9nez has a clothing store.  Gloria Yecenia sells food.  Of course, Josefina is also in the group.\r\n\r\nJosefina is grateful to KIVA and to FRAC for the loans given to groups with hardworking and honest people like Josefina and her friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

S. is 39 years old.  He lives with his wife and two children in the community of Canalete, which is located in Upala in the province of Alajuela.  This region is a semi-mountainous area known for being a center of agriculture and livestock farming. It is a community that has great potential for development and establishment of microenterprises, in both agribusiness and trade.\r\n<p>\r\nFor four years, Don Eliecer has been raising chickens for fattening, as well as hens, for producing meat and eggs.  He sells his products to the residents of the community who are very satisfied.  He says having the support and help of his wife makes him continue with this endeavor. Don Eliecer also says that his work is very interesting because he has seen his business grow slowly and demand getting stronger.\r\n<p>\r\nAt the moment, Don Eliecer is requesting a microloan of 680,000 colones to buy more chickens and hens, concentrated feed, and medicines to help combat disease.  He also would like to enlarge and reinforce the structures that house his animals.  With these changes, he hopes to grow his business and improve his quality of life.  Although the business is doing well, the lack of capital has prevented any plans for expansion.  With the loan he requested, Don Eliecer expects to increase his sales and improve the financial condition of his family.  \r\n<p>\r\nDon Eliecer is a member of the Canalete Community Credit Enterprise, one of the 100 partner organizations affiliated with EDESA in Costa Rica. This is his first loan and he hopes to continue growing personally and economically. He is an active participant in his community\u2019s credit organization.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva
