Espero poder seguir vendiendo mas para ayudar a mis hijos en sus carreras universitarias.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Hoja de huerta, amarre, harina de maiz, manteca, sal, especias, cubitos, papas y otros","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Tegucigalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.1 -87.216667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":5,"posted_date":"2006-11-03T05:46:57Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-18T11:05:25Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":350,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2006-12-06T02:20:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T09:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":2809,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2007-01-06T01:23:34Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T09:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":3889,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2007-02-04T23:57:28Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T09:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":6603,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2007-03-04T10:30:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T09:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9257,"comment":"scheduled payment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2007-04-04T16:26:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T09:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":12318,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2007-05-04T16:04:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T09:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15169,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2007-06-04T09:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T09:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20026,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2007-07-04T09:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T09:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":28722,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2007-08-04T09:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T09:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":38691,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":35,"processed_date":"2007-09-04T09:15:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T09:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50274,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2006-11-04T11:05:25Z","paid_date":"2007-09-04T09:15:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":1170,"name":"Maria Blanca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"By my age no longer I can work in a large company, so I needed to start my own business.

Sin embargo esta consciente de que para poder generar mas ingresos necesita invertir m\u00e1s, es por este motivo que esta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo por la cantidad de US$ 925 a 6 meses, con el cual podr\u00e1 estar preparada para las ventas en el pr\u00f3ximo invierno. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":1472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","use":"To purchase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Pedro Escobedo, Quer\u00e9taro","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2006-11-05T07:50:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-20T02:03:16Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":925,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2007-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2007-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2007-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2007-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2007-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":154.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":154.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":155,"local_amount":155,"processed_date":"2006-12-13T21:50:30Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-07T09:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":3073,"comment":null},{"amount":155,"local_amount":155,"processed_date":"2007-02-03T17:54:59Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-07T09:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":6333,"comment":null},{"amount":155,"local_amount":155,"processed_date":"2007-02-21T06:11:43Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-07T09:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":7668,"comment":null},{"amount":155,"local_amount":155,"processed_date":"2007-03-20T10:30:55Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-07T09:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10415,"comment":"scheduled payment"},{"amount":305,"local_amount":305,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T09:25:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-07T09:25:16Z","rounded_local_amount":305,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15329,"comment":"scheduled repayment"}],"funded_date":"2006-11-06T02:03:16Z","paid_date":"2007-05-07T09:25:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":1178,"name":"Francisco","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Francisco C.

He originally started out by borrowing a little bit from his mother so that he could sell chicken out of their house. He realized that he would need to become a member of the market near his house in order to reach his customers. Two years have gone by, and everything is going well for Marcos. His wife and daughter constantly motivate him to work hard because Mr. Ordonez is the only source of income for the family right now. Marcos is applying for a new loan so that he can purchase items in cash at the local markets in order to get great discounts and pass the savings on to his customers. With this money he hopes to buy a refrigerator, as well as more chicken and eggs.

is a 20-year-old budding entrepreneur from the Roma ghetto of Sliven, Bulgaria.  She is married with two children.  The Roma, commonly referred to as Gypsies, are a severely marginalized group on the Balkan Peninsula of southeastern Europe and typically have scant access to credit.  <p>\r\n\r\nLast month, Radka opened up a tiny food shop where she sells inexpensive packaged foods on the main square in the ghetto.  Her plan is to begin selling hot sandwiches from her shop.  She realizes that there is little margin in selling pre-packaged foods and, while she may not phrase it this way, wants to get into a higher value added service business.  Previously, she thought she would have to wait a year to build up the capital to afford the equipment she will need for this venture; she was thrilled to hear about the Kiva program and the credit you can offer her.  Radka has never had a regular job before; her education ended early, the Bulgarian economy is weak and the Roma face intense discrimination from the ethnic Bulgarian population.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans.

Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu.

I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning.

Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.

Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

Its goal is to create employment, and it will allow us to contribute to the economic development of our country, because our long-term objective is to form an official SME (Small\/Medium Enterprise, a status which entitles holders to various state-sponsored business promotion services in Senegal), to hire paid staff and therefore create employment, and to import from and export to other African countries such as the Ivory Coast with Wax (a traditional African cloth) skirts, Gabon with Gabonese robes, Morocco with jallab\u00e9 and other leather or artificial leather accessories \u2013 and why not? \u2013 with the countries of Asia as well.\r\n\r\n<p>Original French:\r\n\r\n<p>\"Le projet est destin\u00e9 \u00e0 commercialiser les produits des produits africains (art\u2026).

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines.  Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities.  Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members.

Tambien los dias lunes, martes y miercoles salgo a comunidades vecinas a vender de manera ambulante para tener mayor ingreso. Mi esposo se dedica a la agricultura y solamente cosecha 1 vez al a\u00f1o, por lo que necesitamos tener otros ingresos para mantener a mis hijos en sus estudios y darles alimentacion y salud."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":1692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Compra de blusas, faldas, camisas, calcetines, pa\u00f1uelos y otros.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":5,"posted_date":"2006-11-05T23:26:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Digna Emerita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-20T03:09:35Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2006-12-06T02:21:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-05T16:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":2834,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-01-06T01:34:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-05T16:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":3957,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-02-05T16:03:49Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-05T16:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":6736,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-03-05T10:30:31Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-05T16:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9414,"comment":"scheduled payment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-04-06T16:04:56Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-05T16:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":12482,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-05-05T16:25:35Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-05T16:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15246,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2006-11-06T03:09:35Z","paid_date":"2007-05-05T16:25:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":1314,"name":"Bertha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bertha is married and has three children; they are studying and also help her with the business.

is a group loan to be shared by five members of the women\u2019s savings association Jabboot, whose representative, Awa G., submitted the following business plan description:\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe women of the village who are members of the Jabboot Association are very active in weaving cloth for skirts and other articles of clothing, and those who are teachers have innovated with the sale of textbooks and school supplies in the local schools.\r\n\r\n<p>The overall objective of this project is to improve the profitability of the small-scale commercial activities of the Jabboot Association members.  The first activity will consist of buying school books and supplies in bulk at a very good price, and reselling them at very fair prices in the schools, where the parents\u2019 associations do not have a functioning cooperative.  Throughout the year the pupils will need new school supplies and books.  The second activity is the production and sale of skirts, blankets, bed sheets and other articles of clothing (robes etc).\r\n\r\n<p>Jabboot is a group whose members are quite active and experienced in the area of selling school supplies and school books; the lack of financial support has always been the obstacle to strengthening and expanding these activities.  This is a group of women who dedicate themselves at the same time to the sale of skirts and other articles of clothing, and this activity is very profitable.  With a little financial support the group members will make a great deal of profit, with a learning impact on other sectors such as traditional artisanry.  \r\n\r\n<p>With the framework that the village committee has put in place for the management of this loan, we will fulfill all our responsibilities under the repayment plan, taking into account the time required for production at each stage, and the management plan will have as its goal adherence to the loan repayment schedule.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Original French:\r\n \r\n<p>\"Les membres ( femmes ) de l\u2019 \u00e9covillage regroup\u00e9es dans (JABBOOT) sont tr\u00e8s actives dans le domaine du tissage des pagnes et autres effets vestimentaires mais les membres enseignants  ont innov\u00e9 avec la vente de manuels et fournitures scolaires dans les \u00e9coles.\r\n<p>Objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral : Am\u00e9liorer les activit\u00e9s du petit commerce au profit des membres \r\ndu groupement JABBOOT\r\n<p>ACTIVITES :\r\n<p>Activ\u00e9s 01\r\n<p>Il s\u2019agira d\u2019acheter dans un premier temps du mat\u00e9riel scolaire( manuels et fournitures) \u00e0 de tr\u00e8s bon prix et les revendre avec des prix tr\u00e8s adapt\u00e9s dans les \u00e9coles ou les associations des parents d\u2019\u00e9lev\u00e9s n`ont pas de coop\u00e9rative fonctionnelle.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines.  Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities.  Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members.  However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.  This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.  Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n

Subsistence is always a battle in this arid region, where most people still depend on rain-fed cultivation of their staple crops: millet, yams and peanuts.

The leader of the Thialene group, Alioune S., describes their plan to invest loan funds in an irrigation pump:  \r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe loan will be used to provide the group members with an irrigation pump with a capacity of 300 cubic meters per hour, which can irrigate 10 hectares of land.  The pump will be managed by a maintenance person who will take charge of ensuring its good working condition.

Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members.

She knew how to make the hand made art and also learned how to make typical art and crafts of the city. This city is a touristy place and attracts many people from all over the world. When Francisca began her business she started to sell arts and crafts which were made manually but with the passing of the time her business was growing and she could not make enough merchandise so she began to buy art and crafts from other people to sell to her clients. Her husband saw that the business was a success and decided to support her and actually they have two small stores.

The loan will finance the business of selling local grains (millet) and seafoods, to be undertaken by the women following a rotation schedule of ten people per lending period (In other words, the loan will go into a group fund which will be lent to ten members to finance their individual enterprise activities for a fixed period of time, then lent in turn to the remaining ten members.  Funds reimbursed to Kiva would be replaced by contributions from the group members\u2019 profits).  The fruit and vegetable market is not saturated in Foundiougne, which is a large city (near Mbam).

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

Parcelles Assainies.  The teachers plan to add computer training to their curriculum, and have applied for a loan to finance the purchase of P3 computers and other necessary supplies.  The demand for computer literacy training in Senegal is strong and growing even in rural areas, and the group plans to earn a profit by charging a small tuition fee to the large number of students expected to enroll.  The program director who will sign for the loan, Jean Christophe D., described the project:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe TIC children\u2019s program was born from the realization of children\u2019s lack of access to the educational opportunities offered by the recent explosion of information technology in Senegal.  This situation is due to the inexistence of an institutional framework for bringing information technology to children, the failure to adapt existing computer education programs to children, parents\u2019 lack of interest in this tool and in the opportunity it offers, and the prohibitive cost of Cybercaf\u00e9s for children.  The TIC children\u2019s program responds to this need and is designed to raise children\u2019s level of access to information technology.  It aims to contribute in this way to the early education of young children as well as the training of young adolescents.<p>\r\n\r\nThe objective of the loan is to finance the purchase of computers and the establishment of a working capital fund for the various activities to be undertaken as part of this project:<p>\r\n\u2022\tThe installment of the necessary infrastructure and computers<p>\r\n\u2022\tThe launch of computer education classes<p>\r\n\u2022\tThe marketing of the computer classes<p>\r\n\u2022\tThe organization and management of the program<p>\r\n\u2022\tThe execution of computer classes for 90 children per month, each of whom will pay a tuition fee of 3000 francs CFA (about $6), for 12 months<p>\r\n\r\nWe have a building in the village of Parcelles Assainies, at the Centre d\u2019Excellence des Parcelles Assainies, number 10.

loan will be shared among the twenty members of Ujamoral, a women\u2019s rotating credit and savings association based in the tiny island village of Carabane at the mouth of the Casamance River. The Diola people who live on the mangrove islands of the Casamance River have developed a complex trading system in which each island village produces its own specialty good, such as dried shrimp or palm oil.  Small-scale commerce is traditionally a women\u2019s activity here, and the Diola women spend a lot of time crisscrossing the river in handmade wooden canoes to buy and sell the various island products.  The island of Carabane is especially well known for its oysters, which are reputed to be among the best in West Africa, as well as for a strong wine made from the pressed fruit of the cashew tree.  However, most of Carabane\u2019s residents earn their living from fishing, and the women there often produce smoked fish and oysters which they transport and sell in markets as far away as Dakar and Banjul, where they are in high demand for flavoring traditional stews and sauces.  The Ujamoral group has applied for a loan to launch just such a smoked seafood business, to cover the purchase of a canoe for fishing and collecting shellfish, equipment for smoking the seafood, and transportation of the finished products to market.  The group\u2019s leader, Khadijatou N., submitted the following business plan:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Ujokoral group is made up of the women of the village of Carabane who are active in the production and trade of seafood products.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

These maids come from Serrer farming villages in the interior, where food production has declined so much in recent years that outside sources of income are needed to avert famine in the months before the October harvest season.  Those that manage to find work as housemaids in the city typically earn around $20 a month, plus a sack of rice to send home to their families.  This group of maids, led by Ndong D., learned about the SEM microfinance program through the evening literacy classes they were attending at our partner organization, CRESP.  They submitted the following proposal for a loan to finance a plan to move beyond maid\u2019s work by starting a business to sell  local produce, snacks and meals from street-side stands:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cThis project is to sell bissap (a sweet, bright-red drink made from the flowers of the African bissap plant), vegetables and sandwiches; buying millet (in bulk from producers) and reselling it to the women who sell couscous and millet porridge; selling bread (in Senegal women purchase loaves from the bakeries each morning and resell them from simple street-side stalls); buying beans, tables, and eggs (for preparing and selling simple meals and snacks).

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The group hails from Palmarin, a tiny fishing village on the edge of the immense salt flats of the Saloum River delta in central Senegal.  Palmarin\u2019s location favors the production of gejj, the salty dried fish that is a staple of traditional Senegalese cooking and is in high demand by housewives throughout the country.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":2893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Dried fish

Les d\u00e9buts de cette activit\u00e9 n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faciles pour Madame A. \u00e0 cause des moyens tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9s. Elle avait commenc\u00e9 ses activit\u00e9s avec $ 50. Avec sa foi en ce qu\u2019elle fait et par son courage, elle a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 augmenter son capital \u00e0 $ 300 gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 trois cr\u00e9dits successifs qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 bien rembours\u00e9s.\r\n\r\nElle associe aussi \u00e0 ce commerce du louga, la vente de l\u2019arachide grill\u00e9e embouteill\u00e9e. Compte tenu de la qualit\u00e9 de ses produits, des bonnes femmes viennent s\u2019en procurer en gros chez elle pour les revendre. Aujourd\u2019hui, la demande est si forte que certains clients passent des commandes au moins une semaine d\u2019avance, mais n\u2019en trouvent pas. \r\n\r\nMadame A. n\u2019est pas en mesure de satisfaire toute sa client\u00e8le \u00e0 cause de l\u2019insuffisance de ses moyens. Aussi, sollicite-t-elle un cr\u00e9dit $ 500 pour accro\u00eetre la taille de sa production et d\u2019augmenter ses revenus. Le cr\u00e9dit servira \u00e0 constituer un stock permanent d\u2019arachide et de sucre favorisant la production sur toute l\u2019ann\u00e9e\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":3062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Fabrication and selling of \u201cLOUGA\u201d (biscuit of groundnut)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Lom\u00e9","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":22,"posted_date":"2006-11-09T17:12:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"C\u00e9cile","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-24T15:01:12Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":166.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2006-12-28T09:32:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-03-02T02:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":3723,"comment":null},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-01-30T20:35:32Z","settlement_date":"2007-03-02T02:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5694,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2007-03-02T02:05:34Z","settlement_date":"2007-03-02T02:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":8538,"comment":"scheduled payment"}],"funded_date":"2006-11-10T15:01:12Z","paid_date":"2007-03-02T02:05:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":1487,"name":"Massan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"About 35 years old, she is a widower and mother of three (3) children. Having not the chance to go to school, Madam Massan N. swore that none of her children will remain illiterate like her and is fighting for their education. Very clever and active, she remains one of the working women in the village of Ahonkp\u00e9 where she lives with her orphans. Her main activity is to purchase cassave and process it into flour (cassava flour), one of the basic foods in south Togo. Madam N. has shown proved to be an honest and trustworthy woman through the repayments without incidents of her first two credits granted.\r\n\r\nThe flour production is a very hard activity with many risks of injury due to a lack of suitable tools.  Buying a tool, the rough, with a credit of $750 will provide an important opportunity to increase her production and income. The rough could even be rented to other women in the area.  This will provide to them significant income. Having the rough avoids making a 3 to 5 km trek to have the cassava rasped. The remainder of the credit will serve to buy cassava in other farms to have sufficient raw materials for the regular production all over the year.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nAg\u00e9e de 35 ans environ, elle est veuve et m\u00e8re de trois (03) enfants. N\u2019ayant pas eu la chance de s\u2019instruire, Mme Massan N. a jur\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun de ses enfants ne restera analphab\u00e8te comme elle et se bat pour leur \u00e9ducation. Tr\u00e8s intelligente et tr\u00e8s bien appliqu\u00e9e, elle reste l\u2019une des femmes de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence  dans le village de Ahonkp\u00e9 o\u00f9 elle vit avec ses orphelins. Son activit\u00e9 principale est l\u2019achat de manioc et sa transformation en gari (farine de manioc), l\u2019un des aliments de base au Sud du Togo. Mme Massan N. a fait preuve d\u2019honn\u00eatet\u00e9 et de femme de confiance \u00e0 travers les remboursements sans incidents de ses deux premiers cr\u00e9dits obtenus.\r\n\r\nLa fabrication du gari est une activit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s p\u00e9nible avec tous les risques de blessures dus au manuel traditionnel de r\u00e2page du manioc car ne disposant pas de r\u00e2peuse. \r\nLe financement d\u2019une r\u00e2peuse et d\u2019un fonds de cr\u00e9dit de $ 750 serait un apport tr\u00e8s capital pour augmenter sa production et facto ses revenus. La r\u00e2peuse pourra m\u00eame \u00eatre lou\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u2019autres femmes de la localit\u00e9, ce qui lui procurerait d\u2019autres recettes non n\u00e9gligeables.

Realizing that this activity is profitable, Mr T. has trade in that domain for another specialization.\r\n\r\nThe market gardening production. Particularly, the dry season cultures are very profitable because at that period the products are nearly nonexistent on the markets and those who are doing it, make much benefits. To that purpose, motor pumps are needed, what Mr T. does not have unfortunately.

Very laborious and without complexity, she started to cook and sell before the schools from the small financial support of $300 got from MICROFUND.\r\nWith such good experience, Miss Diana wants to increase her activities by the opening of a small \u201cBar Restaurant\u201d with traditional menus well appreciated nowadays. The project forecasts also the training on job of young girls in difficult situation. In the day time, she will serve the traditional meals and in the evenings, she will serve spaghettis, salads, tea or coffee, fried etc.\r\n\r\nThis project, if it happens to be realized as forecast, will allow among others, to: - Be self employed and create jobs for three (03) young girls as salaried contributing thus to the jobless decrease - Serve the meals of quality but at less cost to the customers -Increase her incomes and improve her living conditions on the social, economic and financial plans in order to escape the circle of poverty. \r\nThe credit of $850 requested will serve to rent one location and build a shed, acquire the kitchen materials and utensils to have consequent revolving funds at the size of the activity.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nN\u00e9 d\u2019une famille nombreuse et tr\u00e8s pauvre, Mlle Diane Awan A. a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 boucler les \u00e9tudes primaires et secondaires dans des conditions assez difficiles. Oblig\u00e9e d\u2019abandonner pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment ses \u00e9tudes par manque de support, Mlle Diane a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 se former en cuisine moderne (sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s africaines, europ\u00e9ennes et am\u00e9ricaines). Malheureusement, elle s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9e en ch\u00f4mage apr\u00e8s sa formation. Tr\u00e8s \u00e9l\u00e9gante, laborieuse et sans complexe, elle a commenc\u00e9 par pr\u00e9parer au bord des rues et devant les \u00e9coles.  \r\nAvec cette exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9ussie, Mlle Diane veut agrandir ses activit\u00e9s par l\u2019ouverture d\u2019un petit \u00ab Bar restaurant \u00bb aux menus traditionnels tr\u00e8s bien appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s actuellement au Togo. Le projet pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement la formation sur le tas des jeunes filles en situation difficile. Dans la journ\u00e9e, elle servira des repas traditionnels et les soirs, spaghettis, salades, th\u00e9 ou caf\u00e9, frites, etc.\r\nLa r\u00e9alisation de ce projet, lui permettra, notamment d\u2019augmenter ses revenus et d\u2019am\u00e9liorer ses conditions de vie afin de sortir du cercle vicieux de la mis\u00e8re. Ceci est d\u2019autant plus \u00e9vident qu\u2019elle \u00e9vitera de s\u2019exposer ou de se retrouver dans les mains des hommes peu scrupuleux avec VIH\/SIDA qui s\u00e9vit aujourd\u2019hui. \r\n\r\nLe cr\u00e9dit de $850 sollicit\u00e9 servira \u00e0 louer  un petit emplacement ou local et acqu\u00e9rir les mat\u00e9riels et ustensiles de cuisine, disposer d\u2019un fonds de roulement \u00e0 la taille de l\u2019activit\u00e9.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":3145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To
