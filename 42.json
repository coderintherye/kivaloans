Because her 1 mother pig bore 9 piglets, healthy dan fat. Besides that Jero Ketut Pudak raised 3 other piglets to be fattened. Her husband Gusti Nyoman  Tulis work as a building laborer. Every day Jero Ketut Pudak with persistence raised these 9 one-month old  piglets. Loan from Dinari for Rp 1,700,000 (about US$190-200, depending on exchange rate) are used to buy rice and wheat shell clippings, and konsentrat (local brand). Animal feed price has increase lately, so that the Rp1,700,000 ($200) was not sufficient, since her husband who works as laborer only earns Rp40,000 (about $5)\/day. The additional capital from Dinari would be used to cover the animal food shortage. That is why Jero Ketut Pudak hopes that she could obtain additional loan from Dinari. The stall condition is very simple from wood. The plan is that after harvest she could build a permanent stall. Those are Jero Ketut Pudak wishes. She also has 2 raise 2 children still at school.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDi lingkungan tetangganya di desa Ekasari Jero Ketut Pudak termasuk peternak yang berhasil. Karena 1 induk babinya beranak 9 ekor, anaknya sehat dan gemuk. Disamping itu Jero Ketut Pudak memelihara 3 ekor penggemukan. Suaminya Gusti Nyoman Tulis bekerja sebagai tukang bangunan. Setiap hari Jero Ketut Pudak dengan tekun memelihara 9 anak babinya yang baru berumur 1 bulan. Semua modal pakan yang dipergunakan didapat dari Dinari. Modal yang dipinjam sebesar Rp.1.700.000,- modal ini dipergunakan untuk membeli dedak padi , dedak poral dan konsentrat. Setiap hari semua babinya diberi makan 2 kali setiap pagi dan sore. Harga pakan saat ini semua naik, modal Rp.1.700.000,- masih kurang oleh sebab itu suami Jero Ketut Pudak rajin bekerja sebagai tukang karena upah tukang perhari Rp.40,000,-. Modal tambahan ini bisa untuk menutupi kekurangan pakan ternaknya. Oleh sebab itu Jero Ketut Pudak sangat berharap pinjaman dari Dinari bisa meningkat. Kondisi kandang Jero Ketut Pudak masih sederhana kandang kayu. Rencananya panen nanti kandangnya akan dibuat kandang permanen itu harapan Jero Ketut Pudak disamping itu juga bisa membiayai 2 anaknya yang masih duduk dibangku sekolah."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":73528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy pig feedsock and animal feed<p>Membeli bibit dan pakan babi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-11T16:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jero Ketut Pudak","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-25T17:27:19Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-11-25T10:22:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86409,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:36:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100255,"comment":null},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:17:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119060,"comment":null},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T01:27:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138521,"comment":null},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164678,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-04-25T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191326,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-11T17:27:19Z","paid_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20640,"name":"Vay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Vay S., age 26, works in a garment factory, earning around $3 per day.

Besides taking care of her 2 school age children, Wayan Astiti also runs a pig farming business. Wayan Astiti's husband Ketut Rana is also busy raising government own cows, so everybody is busy. Wayan Astiti raise 1 mother pig and 1 male pig. The mother pig is now 1 month pregnant. The male pig is quite profitable, each husbandary could earn her Rp 30,000 (about US$3.30). Each month from husbandary Wayan Astiti could earn Rp 500,000 (about $55). That is why  Wayan Astiti dare to borrow from Dinari for Rp1,700,000 (about $187). This capital will be used to buy rice shell clippings, wheat shell clippings and tofu leftovers. Since tofu leftovers is good for pregnant mother pig, Wayan Astiti is persistent in learning how to raise pigs. Wayan Astiti wish is that her pregnant mother pig could bore plenty and healthy piglets.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSebagai Seorang ibu rumah tangga yang baik Wayan Astiti tidak bisa berpangku tangan saja. Selain disibukan untuk mengurusi 2 anaknya yang sudah bersekolah wayan Astiti juga memiliki usaha beternak babi. Suami Wayan astiti ketut Rana juga memiliki kesibukan pelihara sapi kereman milik pemerintah jadi semuanya memiliki kesibukan . Kesibukan yang dimiliki Wayan Astiti memelihara 1 induk babi dan 1 pejantan. Induk babinya baru dikawinkan umur kehamilannya baru 1 bulan. Pejantan yang dimiliki Wayan astiti cukup laris , harga setiap kawin mencapai Rp.30,000,-. Setiap bulan dari hasil pejantan saja Wayan Astiti mendapatkan uang Rp.500,000,-. Oleh sebab itu wayan Astiti berani pinjam modal di Dinari sebesar Rp.1.700.000,-. Modal ini dipergunakan untuk membeli dedak padi, dedak poral dan ampas tahu.

year. From the permanent stall in her backyard, Sri Kuntari Dewi raised 3 mother pigs. Capital of Rp1,700,000 (about US$200) was all used to buy pig's feed. In 3 months mother pig could bore up to 10 piglets. So in 3 months she could profit Rp1,500,000 (about $170). This profit was used to buy feed for the 3 mother pigs, and partly for household needs. Although no more children to raise, Sri Kuntari Dewi still will be doing business to continue her future, and helping her husband Gusti Ngurah Windra Artika in fulfilling daily household needs. For the future Sri Kuntari Dewi like to use the loan to buy another mother pig. Because this is profitable, Sri Kuntari very much like to do it.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nTiga kali dalam sehari tepatnya Pukul 08.00 Wita,siang pukul 13.00 wita dan sore pukul 17.00 wib Sri Kuntari Dewi melakukan aktivitas yang sudah digeluti selama 1(Satu) tahun ini,yaitu memberi makan babi peliharaannya. Dengan kandang yang permanen dibelakang rumahnya,Dewi Kuntari memelihara 3(tiga) induk babi. Modal Rp.1.700.000,- ini semua dipakai untuk membeli pakan babinya. Dalam 3(tiga) bulan induk babi ini akan melahirkan 10(sepuluh) ekor anak babi.Jadi keuntungan yang didapat dalam 3 bulan sebesar Rp.1.500.000,-. Keuntungan ini digunakan untuk membeli pakan untuk ketiga induk babinya,dan sebagian untuk kebutuhan rumah tangganya.Walaupun tidak ada anak yang ditanggung lagi,Sri Kuntari Dewi tetap berusaha untuk kelanjutan masa depannya,sekaligus membantu suaminya Gusti Ngurah Windra Artika,dalam mencukupi kebutuhan sehari-hari. Untuk kedepannya sri kuntari dewi ingin pinjamannya digunakan untuk menambah induk babi lagi 1 ekor. Karena usaha ini sangat menguntungkan sehingga sri kuntari sangat senang dalam menjalaninya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":73542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy pig feed and feedstock<p>Membeli bibit dan pakan babi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-11T18:35:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sri Kuntari Dewi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-25T20:21:22Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-10-30T07:21:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T06:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73639,"comment":null},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-11-28T02:10:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T06:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87761,"comment":null},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T02:28:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T06:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100317,"comment":null},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:35:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T06:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119121,"comment":null},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T01:05:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T06:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139708,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-03-26T06:10:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T06:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166032,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-10-11T20:21:22Z","paid_date":"2008-03-26T06:10:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20648,"name":"Yem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs.Yem S., age 42, works with her husband farming their land to grow rice and vegetables.

lives in Saatli, Azerbaijan.  He is 57 years old, married and has 6 children.  Shamil owns 3 dairy cows.  He is the sole income earner in the family and works by milking the cows and selling the milk at the local market.  It is very hard to provide for a family of 6 children and Shamil plans on increasing the production and sales of milk by increasing the number of cows.  <p>\r\n\r\nHe has turned to Normicro, a Kiva partner, with a loan request of $500 for the purchase of dairy calves.  These calves cost $100 each in the local market, so Shamil can purchase 5 calves and triple his milk production.  This will provide Shamil with $500 of pure profit per month.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u041c\u0440. \u0428\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043b\u044c

I. lives in in Saatli, Azerbaijan.  He is 52 years old, is married and has 6 children.  Rahim is the sole income earner for his family and earns his living by raising and selling large cattle on the local market.  Every year he purchases young calves from households in local villages, grows them for 8-9 months in his household and then sells the already grown cows and bulls to local butchers. <p> \r\n\r\nToday, Rahim is thinking about expanding his business as the profits from his current herd are not enough to provide for the needs of 6 children.  He plans to expand his annual purchase of calves by 5.  For this he needs $500 to invest in his business.  Rahim turned to Normicro, a KIVA partner, to receive this sum.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p\r\n\r\n\u0418\u0431\u0438\u0448\u043e\u0432

As a Balinese woman, it has been a tradition to raise pigs at home. Most of such business are side business. This is not the case for Ni Putu Artini, since this business could bring good profit for her family, if done well. Ni Putu Artini runs this pig farming with dicipline and persistence, since she wants to advance family economic situation. Before, Ni Putu Artini only raised 1 mother pig. That mother pig bore up to 12 piglets. After 4 months those piglets could be sold for Rp 250,000 (about US$28)\/each. After subtracting all expenses, Ni Putu Artini could still have enough profit to support her family. With Dinari's loan, Ni Putu Artini plans to buy 1 other mother pig. She already calculated: With the mother pig ready to be impregnated, and ready to bore piglets, within the 6 month loan, Ni Putu Artini could sell the pig feedstock, and the loan could be returned timely. Ni Putu Artini plans to expand the business so that her family economic condition would improve.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nNi Putu Artini tinggal di desa Ekasari, Bali Barat. Sebagai seorang wanita Bali, sudah menjadi tradisi untuk memelihara babi dirumah. Sebagian besar memang usaha ini digunakan sebagi usaha sampingan. Hal itu tidak berlaku bagi Ni Putu Artini, karena usaha ini baginya dapat mendatangkan keuntungan yang cukup besar bagi keluarganya jika diolah dengan baik. Ni Putu Artini mengelola usaha ternak babi dengan disiplin dan rajin, karena ia sangat ingin memajukan perekonomian keluarganya. Sebelumnya Ni Putu Artini memelihara 1 ekor induk. Dari 1 ekor induk itu bisa melahirkan anak sampai dengan 12 ekor. Setelah dipelihara selama 4 bulan, anak babi itu bisa dijual kembali dengan harga Rp. 250.000.- per ekor. Dengan dikurangi semua biaya pengeluaran yang ada untuk perawatan, Ni Putu Artini masih bisa mendapat keuntungan yang dipergunakan untuk kehidupan keluarga.\r\nDengan pinjaman dari Dinari, Ni Putu Artini membelikannya 1 ekor induk lagi.

Yamen, 43, shares a small village house with her elderly parents. Yamen\u2019s entire income comes from selling milk from a milking cow she purchased 2 years ago. The cow yields 7-8 liters of milk daily, which cost about $1.30 on the local market. The money is not enough to sustain Yamen and her parents, so Yamen turned to NorMicro, a Kiva partner, for help. She asks for $500 loan to purchase a milking calf.

P. lives in Saatli, Azerbaijan located in the Southern Caucasus.  She is 58 years old, married and has 5 children.  Her family is large, has few resources and it is getting increasingly harder to support it with the high rates of unemployment.  The only hope is the household\u2019s plot of land and a small herd of sheep.  <p>\r\n\r\nOnce a year Shamama together with her husband sells sheep at the local market, and uses part of the earnings to purchase lambs and the rest for meeting the most important needs of the family.  Her grandson helps in the business as well (see photo).  Of course the profits from the sale of such a small herd are small and investment is needed to increase them.  Shamama has applied for a loan with Normicor, a KIVA partner.   After receiving a loan she plans to use it to expand the number of sheep in her herd and to increase profits from their sales.  This will allow her to provide her children with an education at the local school.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva

With a loan of Rp1,400,000 (about US$155) Komang Suarniti bought 2 pig feedstock. So, now she raises 4 pigs. The stalls to raise the pigs are simple, from bamboo walls and cement floor. Besides feedstock, Rp400,000 (about $44) is used to buy pig's feed. Sometimes pig feed are mixed with traditional feed, like banana trunk, lantoro leaves and kangkoong. The house she lives with husband Ketut Kaler are  owned. Besides farming, Ni Komang Suarniti husband's also sells cow's feed, like grass, that are plentiful in their yard. Ketut Kaler already has many customers. 1 bundle of grass was sold for Rp10,000 ($1.10). Ketut Kaler also often helps his wife feeding the pigs.

Dengan  modal pinjaman Rp.1.400.000,- Komang Suarniti membeli bibit babi sebanyak 2 ekor. Jadi babi yang dipelihara sekarang menjadi 4 ekor. Kandang yang dimiliki untuk memelihara babinya sangat sederhana, terbuat dari dinding bambu dan lantai semen. Selain membeli bibit babi, uang sejumlah Rp. 400.000,- digunakan untuk membeli pakan. Kadang - kadang pemberian pakan babi diselingi dengan makanan tradisional seperti: batang pisang, daun lantoro dan kangkung. Rumah yang dihuni sekarang bersama suaminya, Ketut Kaler, adalah rumah milik sendiri. Selain bertani, suami Ni Komang Suarniti juga menjual pakan sapi yang berupa rumput \u2013 rumputan yang banyak ditanam di pekarangan rumahnya.

She sells basic goods like rice, vegetable oil, floor, spaghetti, juice, bread and so forth. She started her business two years ago in order to deal with the family's financial issues. She also sells charcoal (obtained by heating wood), since in her community not all the people have sufficient means to use gas. Women in Don Juan use the charcoal to soften up peas, because peas take a long time to be well-cooked and that consumes a lot of gas.

The worst plight of a mother is to see her kids sick.

She had worked every day, from dawn to dust, with her husband to make their land productive. But something happened that made things harder. Her 23 year old daughter needed a surgical intervention for appendicitis, after which she had to remain in the hospital for 6 months. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> This emergency and its outcome was very painful and expensive for Te\u00f3fila\u2019s family. Her husband had to look for another job to try to make up for all the expenses, so he became a driver. Now Te\u00f3fila has to work double to do the job her husband used to do with her. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> The family can get back on track if they manage to get a loan of US$ 175 to buy the seed needed to cultivate broad beans and potatoes. That investment would return enough profits for them to get back on their feet.

Their customers\u2019 orders have made the business grow little by little. To face this challenge Elva is asking for US$ 200 loan. She will use this money to buy more goods to sell. And maybe, in the long run and working hard, she would get a plot of land. There she would build a little house and set up her store.

Her father helped her by lending her a small amount of money to start her business. With this loan she bought potatoes and grains in bulk. She then began working independently. <p>\r\nShe needed more money to grow her business and accepted the invitation of her neighbor to increase her income by joining a community finance group. With her first loan of  $96 dollars she bought potatoes, barley and other grains. Little by little her business started growing. Presently she distributes her products weekly in the main markets of Trujillo. Thanks to this business she was able to buy land and cultivate her own produce to sell.

Ayudemos a que Elga pueda recuperarse, al igual que su hija de los malos momentos que la vida tiene para alguno de nosotros."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":73803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of items for her small sales stand.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-10-13T08:55:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elga Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-27T12:49:06Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-11-27T10:34:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-27T09:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87735,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-12-27T10:19:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-27T09:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103825,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-01-27T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-27T09:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":122940,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-02-27T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-27T09:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":143404,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-03-27T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-27T09:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167459,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-04-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-27T09:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":193302,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-13T12:49:06Z","paid_date":"2008-04-27T09:10:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":20758,"name":"Piyalo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Married and mother of one child, Piyalo is  an expert  in the preparation of fried  yams and potatoes, called  in local jargon \u201cKoliko.\u201d Koliko is a local food which  any child loves to eat .

Panen  dilakukan setelah pemeliharaan bejalan 3 bulan dengan total penjualan Rp.1.300.000.- Keuntungan  bersih yang didapat sebesar Rp. 500.000.- setelah dikurangi biaya pakan.

His two oldest children currently work along with their father with moto-taxis and the two younger children are still in school. This family has a home and five motos, three of which are used by Jose and his sons to work and the other two are rented out daily. While Jose works as a moto-taxi driver during the week, he works as a carpernter on the weekends, and in both roles he has sufficient experience and has worked like this for more than 20 years. There is a lot of business for transporting passengers by moto-taxi, but there is also large demand along the local highways.

Now she has been doing this noble task for 20 years and is the mother of three children. Her children motivate her day by day to work diligently. Her daily work fills her with pride and makes her feel more independent. Her husband is a mason and his jobs are often sporadic.

For this reason she is asking for a loan of $175 which she would use to buy more wool for her knitting and with which she would increase her income and ensure her children's wellbeing.

Aside from that she weaves jackets made of wool in her free time in order to offer them for sale inside her community in the hopes of generating additional income that would allow an increase in her family\u2019s wellbeing. <P>\r\n She hopes very much to be able to open her own export company of woven hats and to become partners with other women in her community that do the same thing.  Like a good mother she wants to offer her children a comfortable life and a suitable education so that they can forge a prosperous future.<P>\r\nAs a first step to achieve this goal she has dedicated herself to increase even more the variety of weavings she makes and needs more capital to invest.

She is a married woman with four children. L. and her family left Gulu because of the war that was in the north. It was so terrible to the extent that it took so many people's lives. In 1998, L. and her family fled to Kampala and settled on the land (the Acholi Quarters) which was offered to them by the King of Buganda to settle on since he had sympathy for the people of northern Uganda.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen Christine settled in the camp, she began to work in the stone quarry to earn some income. From the stone quarry, she was earning 1000 \/= (about 60 cents; the symbol \/= here stands for Uganda shillings) per day. As time went on, she worked even harder and was able to earn 2000 Uganda shillings (about US$ 1.20) per day. This is how much she is still earning now, which makes her earn 60,000 shillings (about US$ 35) per month.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 2005, Christine joined Life in Africa Foundation where she learned how to make  paper beads and started to earn 60,000 to 100,000 shillings most months.

She does well but with a large family she needs to increase her income to provide for their needs.\r\n<br><br>\r\nChristine's plan is to add capital to expand her business. Demand is high but she needs to add stock to meet this demand.

A. is an Acholi by tribe and was born in 1955. She is a married lady with four children. When the 20-year-war in the north became unavoidable, life was difficult and many lost their lives or were displaced. Lilian, for fear of her life, had to take refugee in Kampala in August 2000. On her arrival in Kampala the only place to settle in was Acholi Quarters which is on one of the hills that the King of Buganda offered to the refugees.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt was Lilian's first time to be in the city and the way of life became difficult. No way to grow your own food, no barter or trade, and no free things. To survive here you needed money and she had none. The option for Lilian was to involve herself in stone quarry activities that helped her generate a little capital.

She did not have a chance to go to school so she is illiterate, for this reason she was afraid of meetings. With the love and support from her group, she applied for and received a loan. She invested the money into raising pigs and poultry.  It was a success, the business grew and grew so she was successful in securing bigger loans in later rounds. She had overcome her shyness and became an active member of TYM branch 3 in the village of Nam Vi\u00eam, Ph\u00fac Y\u00ean where she lives with her husband and 3 children. Ms Tuy\u1ebft requests a loan of 575 USD to buy food and more ducks for her paddling of 60 + ducks.

Ms Le Thi V. puts a lot of efforts to raise all four children. When V. was 43 years old and her first child attended college, her family was in a great need.  With the encouragement of her husband, a retired officer, Ms. V. applied for a 125USD loan from TYM Fund to open a shop selling tea, sundry goods and clothes.  Her monthly income has increased constantly in the past 11 years.  Although all her children are now grown up, and her family has become pretty stable, she has never thought of leaving TYM Fund.  After more than 10 years, V. has considered TYM Fund her second family.

Before joining TYM Fund, her life was really difficult because she could not get any fund to start her business.  Her family income comes from only a 5-acre corn-field.  H.\u2019s first loan from TYM Fund was 50USD.  She used this money to buy soya to make soya curd and sell it to the villagers.  She uses the profit from this small stall and her husband\u2019s wage to pay the weekly repayment.  She also uses the soya waste to feed the pigs. After 6 years, her loan now is 575USD.  From this loan and the savings, she has expanded her business.  Her customers now include not only the villagers but also the other soya curd sellers and restaurant owners near Noi Bai Airport.  She sells up to 50 kg soya curd per day.  At the same time, she buys material for fitting up electrical equipment services.  Her family\u2019s total income now increases to 225USD a month.  This time she plans to borrow 1200USD to buy more soya to make soya curd and buy mash for her 10 pigs.

She said that since she became a member of TYM fund, it had helped her escape the poverty. With each loan that she received, it was divided into 2 parts: one for buying livestock to breed, one for buying poultry to resell at the market. The monthly revenue for her family is about 150 USD. Part of it goes to payment toward the fund and part is re-invested in the business.  With their savings and loans from their family, they had built a 2 storey house in 2005.

is the mother of two small children who are enrolled in basic courses at the school in their city.  She enjoys the support and company of her husband, who makes a living through the extraction of wood.  It is for this reason that Nelly decided to begin selling the wood to increase their profits and to avoid the loss of money that happens when they use third party sellers.  With the intention of starting her work soon, Nelly set up a small space in her home to keep the wood her loving husband obtains through his sacrifices safe for its later marketing.  Before summer starts (along with the scarcity of wood extraction), they have to increase the quantity that they have in their small warehouse, and to be able to carry out their goal, they need the help of each one of you.  With the profits that they receive from the sales of their products, they hope to open a small bakery so they can consolidate their income and increase the quality of life of their children.   Let's help this family make their dreams a reality and remove the obstacles so they can have peace and happiness in their hearts.<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nNelly es madre de dos peque\u00f1os ni\u00f1os que se encuentran a\u00fan cursando estudios b\u00e1sicos en un modesto centro educativo de su ciudad, goza del apoyo y compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo que se dedica a la extracci\u00f3n de madera; es por esta raz\u00f3n que ella decidi\u00f3 incursionar en la venta de estos productos para incrementar sus ganancias y evitar la p\u00e9rdida de dinero cuando recurre a las personas intermediarias.Con el prop\u00f3sito de iniciar pronto con su labor acondicion\u00f3 un peque\u00f1o ambiente de su domicilio con el objetivo de mantener a buen recaudo el sacrificio de su querido esposo para su posterior comercializaci\u00f3n Antes de que se inicie la temporada de verano en la que escasea la extracci\u00f3n de madera, requiere acrecentar la cantidad que posee en su peque\u00f1o almac\u00e9n y para llevar a cabo su prop\u00f3sito requiere de la ayuda de cada uno de ustedes.As\u00ed mismo con las ganancias que reciban por la venta de sus productos desean aperturar una peque\u00f1a panader\u00eda para que puedan consolidar sus ingresos e incrementar la calidad de vida de sus hijos.Hagamos que esta familia convierta sus sue\u00f1os en realidad y extraiga los obst\u00e1culos para sembrar paz y alegr\u00eda en sus corazones."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":74784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","use":"Purchase and supply of wood to increase their sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-10-14T02:15:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-28T14:18:19Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2007-11-28T10:22:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-28T09:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88104,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2007-12-28T10:23:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-28T09:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":104203,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2008-01-28T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-28T09:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123431,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2008-02-28T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-28T09:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":143913,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2008-03-28T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-28T09:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":168039,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2008-04-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-28T09:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":193941,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-10-14T14:18:19Z","paid_date":"2008-04-28T09:07:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":21108,"name":"Fiso","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fiso is a mother of six .
