They need to buy additional cattle to expand their herd, and hope that in 6 months the income from their business will be increased by up to 20%, allowing them to make a US$500 profit from each

She could never imagine that one day she would be an owner of a big store like the one today. \"I was only 23, newly wed. I had no experience\". She did not have a house nor any land, her only hope was that the revenue from her little stand would be enough to cover her daily expenses. Hard working, determination and discipline had enabled her to always repay her loan on time every week. Because of this, her fund limit raised higher and higher each round. Her revenue grew and grew. Ms M. had purchased a 150 square meters space in a prime location in  S\u00f3c S\u01a1n. She had built a 3 storey house with a store selling goods on the first floor. Her 2 children don't have to worry about the expenses for their schooling anymore. Ms M. is requesting a loan of 1200 USD to buy more products for her store.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nB\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u v\u1edbi m\u1ee9c v\u1ed1n vay 50 USD \u0111\u1ec3 m\u1edf m\u1ed9t hi\u1ec7u t\u1ea1p h\u00f3a nh\u1ecf c\u00e1ch \u0111\u00e2y 13 n\u0103m, c\u00f3 l\u1ebd kh\u00f4ng khi n\u00e0o ch\u1ecb Hoa Thi M. l\u1ea1i h\u00ecnh dung ra m\u00ecnh s\u1ebd l\u00e0 ch\u1ee7 m\u1ed9t c\u1eeda h\u00e0ng l\u1edbn nh\u01b0 b\u00e2y gi\u1edd: \"Khi \u1ea5y t\u00f4i m\u1edbi l\u1eadp gia \u0111\u00ecnh, m\u1edbi 23 tu\u1ed5i, ch\u01b0a c\u00f3 kinh nghi\u1ec7m kinh doanh\".

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

Her husband died some time back; fortunately she has managed to look after her children very well. <p>She operates a retail shop near the hospital and sells sugar, rice, samosas, doughnuts, bread, various categories of juices, air-time cards for mobile phones and operates a pay phone.

Adelina is 38 years old and was born in Choctaloma, in the Julc\u00e1n province of the La Libertad region. She attended elementary school up to third grade. She has been living in the Alto Trujillo Projects in the Florencia de Mora district in Trujillo for the past ten years. She has four children and three are her dependants. When she left her village, she looked for a job and found one removing the veins of yellow chili peppers (aji escabeche) for drying or grinding. She made very little money and starting her own business was always on her mind, so she paid close attention to everything that could be of help and this is how she learned to peel garlic. As she worked removing the veins of peppers, she bought small quantities of garlic to peel and sell. She found out about the existence of the Communal Banks  through a neighbor from her native village, and they decided to form \u201cLas Conquistadoras\u201d Communal Bank. Since obtaining her first loan, of approximately $96, she quit her job and started buying garlic, to peel and sell in bulk at the \u201cLa Hermelinda\u201d market in Trujillo. She presently peels and sells 300 kilograms of garlic weekly, giving jobs to three young women. With the recent loan of approximately $318, granted by Manuela Ramos, she intends the buy a scale and shelves, in order to open a grocery store at her home, since her neighborhood is new and there are no stores in the area. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Adelina tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, naci\u00f3 en Choctaloma, caser\u00edo de la Provincia de Julc\u00e1n, Departamento de La Libertad y estudi\u00f3 s\u00f3lo hasta el tercer grado de primaria.

Albina is 32 years old, attended school up to 9th grade, is the single mother of a girl and is expecting a second child. She lives is the Alto Trujillo Projects in the Florencia de Mora district of the Trujillo province. Ms. Albina started her business with a loan of approximately $96 she obtained from \u201cLas Conquistadoras\u201d Communal Bank. With that loan she bought fruits and vegetables to sell at the market of the Victor Larco district at the Trujillo province. With her next loan, she incorporated little outdoor coal stoves (\u201cbriquetas encendidas\u201d) to her sales, which yielded a higher income. However, due to her pregnancy, she was forced to stop selling them, as the emanated smoke constituted a health risk. With the latest loan of approximately $286, given by Manuela Ramos, she bought corn and all kinds of produce to sell at a regular stand she now has in that same market. Ms. Albina dreams about traveling to the Sierra, to her native village of Cuyuchugo, in order to bring potatoes and other products to sell in bulk. She also wants to own her stand at the market. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Albina tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 solo hasta tercer a\u00f1o de secundaria, es madre soltera de una ni\u00f1a y est\u00e1 en espera de otro beb\u00e9.

She is 42 years old and has two young daughters who depend on her. She attended school just up to the third year of high school.\r\n\r\n<p>Mrs. Verail says that she learned to work from a very young age, because she helped her mother sell things on the streets of Otuzco. She became pregnant at age 19 and, because her husband was a student, she had to look for some form of work to help cover the expenses. She started processing dried potatoes and wheat in small quantities to sell in the market, but when she became ill she was prohibited from spending much time in water, so she could no longer process grains. She thought then she could buy grains in bulk and sell them wholesale. Because she needed capital for this, she accepted an invitation from a neighbor to join the Communal Bank called \"The Olive\". With her first loan of approximately $96, she purchased a large quantity of wheat and potatoes, and sold it wholesale. In this way she worked for about two years, saving her resources to start a warehouse, which she did successfully. At present, she does various activities: she and her children take turns working in the warehouse, she buys and sells grains wholesale, and and on Wednesdays and Sundays she sells cheeses in the plaza to pilgrims visiting the Virgen a la Puerta.\r\n\r\n<p>The loan that was recently approved by Manuela Ramos for approximately $636 will be used to buy grains such as wheat and corn, as well as dried vegetables, in bulk. Mrs. Verail hopes to buy a car and two motorcycle taxis to rent out, and in that way she can generate more income.\r\n\r\n<p>(Translated from the Spanish by Naomi Johnson, Kiva volunteer)\r\n\r\n<p>La se\u00f1ora Verail naci\u00f3 en Muchamaca un caser\u00edo de la provincia de Otuzco pero desde muy peque\u00f1a vive en el distrito de Otuzco, Provincia de Otuzco del Departamento de La Libertad; tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad y dos hijas menores que dependen de ella.

She sells and buys recyclables since more than 15 years ago. Thanks to this job and to the help of her husband she could raise and educate her children, as well as improve her home with basic commodities. Francisca, comments that this job of buying and selling recyclables is very complex because one needs to be a quick assessor; when her neighbors come and sell her the products she needs to value and quote on the spot. Francisca and her husband are hard-working dynamic people. They are early risers, they start their working day very early, because of this they sell their products in the main recycling plants of the city. The previous loans that she got from Fundacion Paraguaya were invested in the purchase of a scale and for the enlargement of the floor in her backyard to store the products. Now, she is asking for a loan so she can buy more recyclables such as irons, plastics, and cartons. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Ana Escalante, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Francisca tiene 48 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada y tiene 2 hijos, se dedica a la actividad de vender y comprar art\u00edculos reciclables hace m\u00e1s de 15 a\u00f1os y gracias a  \u00e9ste  trabajo y con la ayuda de su marido pudo mantener y educar a sus hijos, como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n pudo dotar  las comodidades m\u00ednimas a su casa.\r\nFrancisca, comenta que \u00e9ste oficio de comprar y vender \u00e9stos art\u00edculos es muy complejo ya que uno debe ser un tasador veloz, porque los vecinos de la zona se acercan a su domicilio a ofrecerle los art\u00edculos  y en el momento debe cotizar y pagar por la compra.\r\nTanto, Francisca, como su marido, son personas trabajadoras y muy din\u00e1micas, ya que se levantan a muy tempranas horas para iniciar su jornada laboral, debido a que estos productos  ellos los venden a las principales f\u00e1bricas de la ciudad.\r\nLos pr\u00e9stamos que obtuvo anteriormente de la Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya los ha invertido en la compra de una b\u00e1scula, y tambi\u00e9n en la ampliaci\u00f3n del piso de su patio para almacenar sus mercader\u00edas.

Wilfrido has owned a general store and butcher shop for more than 20 years.   He explains that just like all businesses, he has ups and downs in his sales, and right now the drought that is affecting the whole country has caused a small crisis in the number of cattle and with agriculture as well.  Milk and wheat products have gone up in price, causing a drop in sales at the shops.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> One of Wilfrido's greatest hopes is that the economic situation in his country improves.  The current crisis is leading to a lack of opportunities for young people.  This affects entire families,  forcing people into economic exile and in turn, causing a migration of people out of Paraguay to other countries in search of work. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Wilfrido says that thanks to his business, he was able to buy his own house, take care of his family and help his son continue his studies at the university.  With his loan from Fundacion Paraguaya, he would like to buy products to better stock his store, especially with those products that move daily such as milk, meat, beer, soft drinks, wine, noodles and other food products. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEl se\u00f1or Wilfrido tiene 51, est\u00e1 casado y tiene un hijo  de 25 a\u00f1os qui\u00e9n le ayuda en la atenci\u00f3n del negocio.  Wilfrido es propietario de una despensa y carnicer\u00eda desde hace m\u00e1s de 20 a\u00f1os,  comenta que como todo negocio  tiene sus momentos de altas y bajas en cuanto a las ventas, actualmente la sequ\u00eda que est\u00e1 afectando al pa\u00eds genera una peque\u00f1a crisis en el rubro de la ganader\u00eda y la agricultura, por lo que la carne vacuna, la leche  y los productos derivados del trigo aumentaron de precio, eso trajo consigo una disminuci\u00f3n de las ventas en las despensas.\r\nUno de sus mayores anhelos es que mejore la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica actual por la que est\u00e1 pasando el  pa\u00eds ya que la falta de oportunidades para los j\u00f3venes genera una consecuencia que  afecta a las familias, y que trae como consecuencia  el exilio econ\u00f3mico de nuestros compatriotas, \u00f3sea la migraci\u00f3n de las personas a otros pa\u00edses en busca de trabajo.\r\nComenta que gracias a su negocio pudo hacerse de casa propia, mantener a su familia y

She and her husband have three children ages 7, 12 and 18.  Loyola has a business serving food and drinks while her husband drives a minibus.  They both work hard to give their children a good education and quality of life.  On weekends, the whole family works together to serve traditional Bolivian meat dishes, but during the week Loyola's husband is off driving his minibus and Loyola works by herself, or with the help of her children if they aren't in school.  The restaurant is well-situated in the family's home.  They have been open for 12 years and Loyola's cooking is very popular.  This loan, the family's ninth from Agrocapital, will pay for installation of a new gas tank for the minibus, saving the family money on fuel.

a widow, Miatin has to work for her own living since all of her children are married and live with their own family. Before her husband passed away, Miatin had been selling meatball-noodle in a mobile food stall. After his husband passed away, no one could hep her to carry her food stall around. Miatin switched to a stationary food stall near the harbor. She opens her stall from 8AM to 9PM.\r\n\r\nWith initial capital of 300,000 IDR (1USD~9,000 IDR), Miatin can earn a profit of 40,000 IDR daily. She used the profit to pay for her basic needs, for additional working capital and for paying the rent for her food stall of 150,000 IDR per month. With the loan from Dinari, Miatin plans to add more variety to her food stall so she can earn bigger profir and serves more customers.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nSebagai seorang janda, Miatin harus berusaha untuk menghidupi dirinya sendiri karena semua anaknya sudah menikah dan tinggal bersama pasangannya masing \u2013 masing. Sebelum suaminya meninggal, Miatin berjualan bakso dengan cara keliling di lingkungannya. Namun, setelah suaminya meninggal, tidak ada lagi yang bisa mendorong rombong yang dipakainya berjualan. Karena hal itu, Miatin beralih usaha dengan membuka usaha warung nasi di dekat pelabuhan. Miatin membuka usahanya dari pukul 8 pagi sampai pukul 9 malam.\r\n\tDengan modal awal sebesar Rp. 300.000.-, Miatin bisa mendapat keuntungan Rp. 40.000.- per hari. Dengan keuntungan itu Miatin sisihkan untuk keperluan sehari \u2013 hari, menambah modal dan juga untuk membayar sewa tempat usaha sebesar Rp. 150.000.- per bulan. Dengan pinjaman dari Dinari, Miatin berencana untuk menambah jenis dagangannya sehingga ia bisa mendapat keuntungan yang lebih besar dan melayani lebih banyak pelanggan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":66639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase raw materials and ingredients for her food stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-09-18T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miatin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-03T00:51:56Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":75,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2007-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-10-09T03:29:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":64978,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T02:57:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85200,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:15:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100210,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T03:57:26Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116770,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:39Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137341,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-09-19T00:51:56Z","paid_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":18480,"name":"Khan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Khan S.

Sekarang dia tinggal dirumahnya yang sangat sederhana dengan lantai semen dan dinding gedek ditemani oleh seoranng anaknya , Supianto, yang sekarang duduk di bangku STM kelas 2.\r\nTabiah menjajakan jualannya mulai pukul 5 sore sampai pukul 2 dini hari, sedangkan paginya ia melakukan persiapan untuk jualannya sambil mengerjakan pekerjaan rumah tangga. Awal mula Tabiah hanya bermodalkan Rp. 300.000.- dan hanya mendapat sedikit keuntungan yakni Rp. 15.000.- per malam. Keuntungan itu pun harus disisihkan untuk biaya hidup dan uang sekolah anaknya. Namun setelah mendapat pinjaman dari DINARI, Tabiah sudah mampu mengembangkan usahanya dengan menambah jumlah dagangannya sehingga Tabiah mampu meningkatkan keuntungannya menjadi Rp. 50.000.- semalam. Dengan keuntungan itu, kini Tabiah dapat menyisihkan sedikit dari keuntungannya untuk ditabung."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":66757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","use":"To buy merchandises such as cigarettes, snacks, beverages, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-09-20T13:55:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tabiah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-04T14:51:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":75,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2007-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-10-09T03:42:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":64981,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T03:20:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85203,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:15:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100213,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T03:57:26Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116775,"comment":null},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137342,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2007-09-20T14:51:32Z","paid_date":"2008-02-18T01:00:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":18528,"name":"Zinnat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hoshimova Zinnat has been our client since 2002.

Her two eldest children attend high school, another is in 5th grade of elementary school, and the youngest has yet to begin school. \r\n<p>\r\n\tEdith recounted with much sadness how she had to work very hard for 10 years in the neighboring country of Argentina, where she managed to start a small dressmaking business after a lot of sacrifices. \r\n<p>\r\n\tWith a strong desire to return to Paraguay, Edith sold all of her sewing machines to make enough money to move back. With what she could earn from the sale of her machines, she managed to return to Paraguay, build a house, and start a small convenience store business out of her house. \r\n<p>\r\n\tShe started out buying a few goods to sell in her store. With time the business improved, and she began expanding her inventory. Today she is building an additional room to start a small hamburger restaurant. To do this, Edith needs a loan of $800US in order to buy the building materials she needs to finish the room. \r\n<p>\r\n\tHer dream for the future is that her children will be professionals; and, above all, that they will be able to work in their own country without having to immigrate to find work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":66932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ita","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.483333 -57.35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2007-09-18T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-03T03:35:08Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-10-19T09:26:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69562,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-11-19T10:30:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":83754,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-12-19T10:31:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99514,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2008-01-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118232,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2008-02-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138323,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":130,"local_amount":130,"processed_date":"2008-03-19T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":130,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":161329,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-09-19T03:35:08Z","paid_date":"2008-03-19T10:08:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":18616,"name":"Hana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Some people think that only men can be farmers.
