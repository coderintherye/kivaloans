Eliseo works with the support of his four children in the maintenance and commercialization of the fruit. His wife is in charge of the housework and, on occasion, goes to markets to sell fruit. This family has been perfecting everything involved in the production process, as well as increasing their technical skills for the task of land maintenance. This is costly due to the items that are needed in each stage of the production process which are manual weeding or natural control of pests and the use of organic fertilizers, which provide them better yields, since they allow the soil not to deteriorate so much, providing better conditions for seed cultivation and a better quality harvest. With financing, this family will be able to maintain their crops, pay for the harvest, and, in this way, subsist since they offer their products during different seasons during the year which generates enough earnings for them. Eliseo is requesting a loan so he may purchase organic inputs, since the next harvest is in May and requires proper maintenance.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Eliseo tiene 25 a\u00f1os de experiencia en producir pi\u00f1a y pitahaya, actividad que la desarrolla con su familia, habita en Ticuantepe, zona que presenta un clima favorable.

is said that Coca Cola is one of the most recognized symbols in the world. And it\u2019s true. Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of \u2018bar\u2019 selling Coke, Fanta, and Guiness (Pepsi has made it to most African capitals but not to the sticks, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re working on it!). The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing - a very cheap marketing tool. All of which explains why selling soft drinks is such a popular venture, whether you\u2019re the CEO of Coca Cola Ltd in the United States or a micro-entrepreneur in Tanzania.\r\n<p>\r\nThirty-seven year-old Hidaya K. is one such entrepreneur. She is married with three children, aged 4, 12, and 15, and has two other dependents who live with her because their parents died of HIV\/AIDS.\r\n<p> \r\nIn 1996, Hidaya established a soft drink and tailoring business. Working six days a week, and assisted by her sister and one employee, she earns about $85 per month from this business. Hidaya has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase additional stocks of material and soft drinks in bulk. She hopes that this loan will enable her to double her monthly profits. In the future, Hidaya also plans to diversify her business.

This is 37 year-old Mwanaidi M., who is single with two children, aged 7 and 15, and has two other dependents who live with her because they are orphans.\r\n<P> \r\nIn 2007, Mwanaidi established a caf\u00e9.  Working 9 to 12 hours a day, six days a week, and assisted by her mother and two employees, she earns about $260 per month from this business. She now requests a loan of $275 in order to purchase ingredients in bulk. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately $30. In the future, Mwanaidi also plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock and dishes.\r\n<P>\r\nWhen you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling.

The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":133408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase ingredients in bulk for her cafe.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-04T01:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mwanaidi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-18T02:37:57Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-04-18T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":185890,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-05-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":213620,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-06-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":241832,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-07-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270817,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-08-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":300026,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-09-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:15:07Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":330717,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-23T07:12:58Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364767,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":24,"local_amount":26181.85,"processed_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":27910.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347506,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":31981.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970126,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":31981.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886376,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-04T03:37:57Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":38261,"name":"Karomatoy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":133503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase ingredients for her cafe in bulk, including oil, rice, and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-03T19:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-17T20:00:34Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-04-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":185068,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-05-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212768,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-06-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":240925,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-07-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269845,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-08-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":298988,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-09-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":329596,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-17T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-22T07:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":32562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":363624,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":24,"local_amount":26181.85,"processed_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":27910.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347515,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":31981.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970135,"comment":null},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":31981.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886385,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-03T21:00:34Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":38327,"name":"Nsamba's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A teacher by profession, Joseph N. is also a businessman.

In addition the community bank provides support and training on relevant subjects.<p>Associates of \u201cTernura\u201d have a variety of different businesses.  Some own restaurants, some sell vegetables, ice cream, or hamburgers.  They all said that they are excited to be part of the community bank and happy with how the process has gone so far.<p>One client in particular is excited, Julia T. P., as she was elected the president of the community bank for the first loan cycle.  Julia owns a restaurant.  She has owned the restaurant for several years but now she will be able to expand.  With her first loan she plans to buy more tables and chairs to serve more clients.<p>All of the associates will use their loans to invest in their businesses.

Her responsibility as a partner in her household is demonstrated through her restless effort in running her food mart business. Despite very small, the business is very meaningful to her since it provides her with the kind of productive activity as well as with the needed additional income to support the family (e.g., to cover her children's school expenses). For her village community, the food shop is felt very beneficial to save the people from traveling to the city to shop for food. This is what makes her food mart successful although the profit is not that much, around IDR 20,000 to IDR 30,000 per day.

She hopes by so doing, she could increase her family's income to live a more prosperous life in a nice and comfortable house.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nHidup di desa dengan segala keterbatasan yang ada tidak membuat Ni Ketut Sarini bermalas-malasan. Tanggung jawabnya sebagai ibu rumah tangga yang wajib membantu suami ditunjukkannya lewat kegigihannya dalam megelola usaha warungnya. Walaupun masih kecil tapi baginya usaha ini sangat berarti selain bisa memberi kesibukan tapi juga mampu menambah pemasukan bagi keluarganya termasuk juga membiayai pendidikan anaknya. Bagi masyarakat pedesaan yang jauh dari kota keberadaan warung yang menyediakan bahan kebutuhan dapur dirasa sangat bermanfaat kerena mereka tidak perlu pergi jauh-jauh untuk berbelanja. Hal inilah yang membuat warung Ni Ketut Sarini tetap bisa bertahan walaupun dengan keuntungan yang tidak banyak, sekitar Rp 20.000,- sampai Rp 30.000,0 per hari. \r\nHarapannya untuk mengembangkan usaha warung ini mengalami kesulitan karena modal yang dimilikinya sangat terbatas, tidak cukup untuk menambah isi warungnya dengan barang dagangan yang lainnya. Kemudian karena ada peluang kerja sama dengan DINARI dalam bentuk permodalan, Ni Ketut Sarini mendapat pinjaman modal usaha yang kemudian dipakainya untuk menambah jumlah dagangannya.dengan  harapan  bisa meningkatkan pendapatannya sehingga bisa hidup lebih layak lagi dan tinggal di rumah yang nyaman dari hasil-hasil usaha warungnya tersebut."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":133786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To add working capital to buy more merchandising goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-03-09T22:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Sarini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-23T23:01:08Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":7,"local_amount":56000,"processed_date":"2008-04-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":64154.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":190574,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":7,"local_amount":56000,"processed_date":"2008-05-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":64154.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":218088,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":7,"local_amount":56000,"processed_date":"2008-06-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":64154.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":247066,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":7,"local_amount":56000,"processed_date":"2008-07-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":64154.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":275671,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":7,"local_amount":56000,"processed_date":"2008-08-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":64154.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":305211,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":7,"local_amount":56000,"processed_date":"2008-09-24T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":64154.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":336190,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":2,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":18329.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":370380,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

Most of the people are farmers whose incomes are declining due to cocoa plantation failing to yield properly   and due to the rice paddy fields not generating enough earning because of the raising fertilizer's cost. Some of the community members, who are mostly housewives, decide to help their husband generating more income for the family. They form a group named Kemuning Sari. The members agree to give the name of Kemuning Sari to represent the name of their hamlet of Kemuning and to reflect the Balinese belief of 'Sari' which means 'blessing'. They hope that the animals would grow very well as blessed and bring prosperity. Since they have a strong desire and very little capital, they requested for a loan from Dinari Foundation. Dinari then provides training and guidance on how to raise hogs, how to handle and prevent diseases, how to provide good animal feed, and how to manage the financial aspect of hog farming. After they felt comfortable, the group's officers are formed. Ni Putu Miyarni is the chair person, Ni Ketut Budiani is the treasurer, Ni Wayan Suriani is the secretary and there are ten other  members.  The loan will be used to purchase high quality piglets and animal feed. They hope that the earning will grow rapidly so they can improve the economic condition of their families. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nKemuning Sari sebuah kelompok ternak babi yang berlokasi didataran tinggi desa Manistutu, Bali Barat. Sebagian besar masyarakatnya bekerja sebagai petani yang penghasilannya sekarang sedang menurun karena tanaman coklat tidak berbuah dengan baik dan juga sawah yang dimiliki tidak menghasilkan dengan maksimal karena harga pupuk naik dengan drastis. Sehingga anggota kelompok yang sebagian besar ibu-ibu mempunyai keinginan untuk membantu penghasilan suaminya. Maka mereka membentuk sebuah kelompok.  Nama ini diberikan karena sesuai dengan persetujuan anggota,bahwa tempat kelompok berada di dusun Kemuning sedangkan Sari sesuai dengan keyakinan orang Bali bahwa Sari itu berarti berkat. Sehingga nantinya semua ternak yang dipelihara oleh anggota supaya di berkati dan berkembang dengan baik. Karena keinginan yang begitu besar dari anggota untuk menjalankan usaha dibidang beternak babi ,sedangkan modal yang dimiliki  sedikit hanya cukup untuk memelihara babi lokal,maka mereka mengajukan permohonan untuk pembinaan dan pinjaman modal ke Yayasan Dinari. Oleh Dinari kemudian diberikan pembinaan bagaimana beternak yang bagus, cara mengatasi penyakit secara tepat dan cepat, pemberian pakan yang baik,dan juga pengaturan keuangan agar modal untuk memelihara babi tidak dipakai untuk keperluan yang lainnya. Setelah semua dirasa cukup maka dibentuklah sebuah kepengurusan kelompok dimana yang menjabat sebagai ketua adalah Ni Putu Miyarni,Bendahara : Ni Ketut Budiani,Sektretaris : Ni Wayan Suriani dan anggota berjumlah 10 orang, kemudian Yayasan Dinari memberikan pinjaman modal. Modal ini oleh anggota ada yang dipakai untuk membeli bibit unggul  dan ada juga yang dipakai untuk membeli pakan ternak yang berkwalitas.
