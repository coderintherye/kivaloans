is a 40-year-old father of three daughters. He talks with pride about how he gets up at 2 a.m. every morning to heat the water he sells to people to make mate, a popular drink in Paraguay that requires special preparation to give it its unique taste. His main clients consist of carriers whose route crosses in front of his home. Two of his daughters have successfully completed their studies and today have bright futures thanks to the income Merardo earns. His wife supports him unconditionally. He also runs a snack stand selling empanadas, fried steak, and other foods, and plans to start selling fish as well, since he has a freezer where he can store them. Merardo is a hard working and dedicated person who deserves your support.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunter<\/b><p>\r\nMerardo tiene 40 a\u00f1os, es casado,tiene 3 hijas.Cuenta con orgullo que se levanta todos los d\u00edas a las 2 de la ma\u00f1ana para calentar el agua que luego vende a las personas que la utilizan para la preparaci\u00f3n del mate. Comenta que el mate es una bebida que se toma mucho en el Paraguay y que tiene una preparaci\u00f3n muy especial en base a remedios que le dan un agradable sabor.\r\nSus principales clientes lo constituyen los transportistas que se desplazan por la ruta que cruza frente a su casa. \r\nDos de sus hijas lograron culminar sus estudios y hoy d\u00eda son flamantes docentes gracias al ingreso que Merardo genera con sus ventas. \r\nSu esposa lo ayuda incondicionalmente, tambi\u00e9n tiene un peque\u00f1o copet\u00edn en donde vende empanadas, milanesas y otros tipos de comestibles.\r\nPlanea comprar pescados para poder venderlos posteriormente ya que tiene una congeladora en donde podr\u00eda almacenarlos.

After she takes the measurements and her clients choose the frames, she sends the glasses in to get the correct lens put in.

makes furniture in a shop that he runs out of his home. He started off as an assistant for another furniture maker and learned the trade quickly. With the help of his father and with the money he saved from his job he decided to open up his own business. He rented a location where he could work and sell and he also invested in a couple of necessary tools. He soon realized that the costs of renting were too much and he moved the business into his home. <\/p>\r\n<p>This business provides for him, his wife and his three children. He uses his earnings to put his kids through school and dreams of them having college degrees. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carlos is now lending for the second time through Kiva and Mifex. Although Carlos planned to invest his first loan in new machinery he found that the costs were extremely high. He bought a second hand polishing tool that has helped, but most of the money from the loan was invested in raw materials. He was able to increase his production and hire a new worker that helps him greatly. He made some basic improvements to his workshop and his home as well. His children are doing well in school and he is grateful for the opportunity to improve his business. He hopes he can receive a second loan so he may continue to purchase raw materials at large quantities. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from English by Maria Ramirez-Gregg, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<p> Carlos hace muebles y gabinetes en su taller, el cual opera desde su hogar. El empezo como asistente de otro ebanista y aprendio el oficio rapidamente.  Con la ayuda de su padre y el dinero que ahorro de su trabajo, Carlos decidio abrir su propio negocio.  El rento un lugar donde pudiera trabajar y vender sus creaciones.  El tambien invirtio en un par de herramientas necesarias.  Carlos pronto se dio cuenta que el costo de rentar un lugar era demasiado y movio su negocio a su hogar.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Este negocio provee para el, su esposa y sus tres hijos.  El usa sus ganancias para costear el costo de la educacion de sus hijos y suena con el dia en que ellos tengan sus diplomas universitarios.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Esta es la segunda vez que Carlos hace un prestamo atraves de Kiva y MIFEX.  Aunque Carlos planeo invertir su primer prestamo en maquinaria el hallo que los costos eran extremadamente altos.  El compro una pulidora de segunda mano que le ha ayudado pero la mayoria del dinero del primer prestamo fue invertido en materia prima.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> El ha sido capaz de aumentar su produccion y ha podido contratar a un nuevo empleado que le ayuda mucho.  El ha hecho unas mejorias basicas a su taller y a su casa tambien.  Sus hijos van muy bien en la escuela y el esta agradecido de la oportunidad que ha tenido de mejorar su negocio.  El espera poder recibir un segundo prestamo para asi poder continuar comprando materia prima en grandes cantidades.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":42595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Purchase raw materials for furniture making","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-06-14T02:27:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-28T10:21:52Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":88,"processed_date":"2007-07-18T09:15:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33173,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":88,"processed_date":"2007-08-18T09:15:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":43874,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":88,"processed_date":"2007-09-18T09:15:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":55863,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":88,"processed_date":"2007-10-18T09:15:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68805,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":88,"processed_date":"2007-11-18T10:15:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82922,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":88,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T10:15:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98613,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":88,"local_amount":88,"processed_date":"2008-01-18T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117352,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2008-02-18T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137372,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-06-14T10:21:52Z","paid_date":"2008-02-18T10:15:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":11907,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

Through these programs she has been able to support herself in Kampala.\r\n<br><br>\r\nShe was born in Kitgum in Northern Uganda. In the year 2000 she narrowly escaped being abducted by the LRA rebels and was forced to flee her home. Her aunt, who had resettled in Kampala, offered to take her in. These early days were very difficult, almost as difficult as the life she left behind in the war torn North. Her aunt was caring for many other children and very often there was not enough food or other necessities of life. Another aunt invited her to join Life in Africa and this has changed her life by giving her money of her own.\r\n<br><br>\r\nShe has been able to provide herself with a few things and has even been able to rent a small house for herself. She wisely invested her money in a business. She noticed that where she lived in the Kiwatule-Kampala area there were very few shops.

This business is so promising that she now plans to expand in order to increase her profits.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo do this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 250,000\/= to purchase more stock for her shop.

is married and has a one year old son. He used to work in a factory, but they let him go four years ago. Since money was tight and he had mouths to feed, Juan opened up his own business, which has become a local favorite in Guayaquil. In fact, whenever the Mifex team visits Ecuador, Juan (or \u201cNene\u201d as he likes to be called) serves up the best dishes around.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He and his wife work seven days a week managing their restaurant which sells rice & beans, beef, chicken, and chorizo. His wife Betty is the cook, and Nene attends to the clients. It wasn\u2019t easy to start the restaurant because they didn\u2019t have much capital. However, like many other Ecuadorian businesses, they started out by working from home in order to save money. Through perseverance, things have gone pretty well over the past four years. They have received such high demand that they had to build an extension to their home just to make space for more tables. Not only are customers coming from the local neighborhood, but from all around Guayaquil. Nene and Betty run the restaurant from 6:30 pm until 2:00 am.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Juan and Betty have made great progress with their business over the last several months with the help of a Mifex loan. The chairs and tables they bought were good investments as they allowed their customers to be more comfortable. They also used part of their money to buy meats in bulk. Their business has done so great that they are now offering lunch during the day as well.

Also I would like to help to pay for the education of my granddaughter who is in school now.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Laura Kirkvold, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMi nombre es Narcisa Z. me dedico a la venta de productos de consumo popular, tengo mi negocio hace unos 4 a\u00f1os, mis clientes son muy buenos ya que los atiendo personalmente y les doy un trato especial tambien les gusta mi tienda por los precios de venta que les doy. mi meta es abastecerme mas de producto y tener mayores ventas para asi poder contratar una muchacha que me ayude a atender mi tienda ya que yo no me doy abasto sola tambien ayudar a pagarle el estudio a mi nieta que esta en la escuela."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":43002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"purchase of flour, rice, bread, beans, butter, oil, coffee, sugar, cafe, soap, spices, soups, chiles, and pastas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":5,"posted_date":"2007-06-16T17:21:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narcisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-30T19:54:27Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":41.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-07-16T09:15:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-16T10:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":32470,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-08-16T09:15:08Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-16T10:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":43066,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-09-16T09:15:08Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-16T10:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":55013,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-10-16T09:15:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-16T10:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":67837,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-11-16T10:15:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-16T10:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":81988,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2007-12-16T10:15:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-16T10:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97603,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-06-16T19:54:27Z","paid_date":"2007-12-16T10:15:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":12104,"name":"Albertina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Albertina is 39 years old.
