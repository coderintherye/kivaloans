She buys the \"vifaranga\" (\u201cchicks\" in Kiswahili) when they are very small, and then sells them for about $3 per chicken when they have grown. She started this business very recently and has only just begun to sell the older chickens.\r\n\r\nSheila runs her business from her home, and she says that people come at all times of the day and night to buy her chickens. Her monthly profit will vary a lot, she says, because chicks sometimes die of diseases or cannot be sold when they are older because they look unhealthy. She estimates that in the first month of business she made a profit of about $300.\r\n\r\nSheila hopes to use this loan to buy more chicks and chicken feed to expand her business. She will share the loan with the members of her subgroup C of Agano, and subgroup B of the same larger group. The members will hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group have a variety of businesses.

She used the first to increase the inventory at her business, and she paid the loan back successfully with no late payments. She hopes to use this loan to increase her stock of medicines, soaps, and hair products.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Flora is sitting on the bench wearing a green dress. She and the members of her group, Dira, will hold each other accountable for paying back their loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":429688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"To buy more

They are 50-years-old on average, have 5 children, and live in the Bagadadji quarter of Segou village (the 4th administrative region of Mali).They know each other through neighbors, are professional, and work trading miscellaneous articles. After having paid back their last 5 loans, they are together for their sixth loan. They plan on using it to buy 10 pieces of waxed cloth, 4 embroidered dress fabrics, 10 bed sheets, 5 cotton suits for men (Faso danfani), 20 5-meter damasque fabrics, products for dying, 3 tons of wood charcoal, 1 truckload of firewood, 15 sacks of unshelled peanuts, and supplies to make incense. They buy the cloth and linens in bulk once a month in Lom\u00e9, Guin\u00e9e Conakry and Burkina Faso while they purchase the damasque fabric and dye products in Bamako; the firewood and charcoal are provided by transporters from Konobougou. The peanuts and the incense supplies are bought at the Chateau market at Loulouni and Koutiala's stalls. Now, with the holidays approaching, provisions and sales are increasing. They sell the clothing and incense in Sikasso, Dioila, and Macina, traveling across the Angouleme and Bagadadji regions, while the wood and charcoal are sold to households and the peanuts are sold at the weekly fair in Segou and at the Segou Coura Market.

He lives with his two wives and his children in his own house in Sanoubougou I, one of the working-class neighborhoods of Sikasso in the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali.\r\n<p>\r\nHe didn't have the chance to attend school and after having tried several activities without success, he finally initiated himself into commercial activities and began a business trading in electronic appliances (radio sets, cassette recorders, satellite dishes, batteries, dish antennas, cell phones and similar products). That was over 20 years ago. Today he has gained such an experience in his trade that he enjoys a solid reputation among his customers and attracts a lot of orders, but he lacks the financial resources to fully meet this demand.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is why he came to Soro Yiriwaso and applied for his third individual loan. He will use it to buy 20 radio sets of various brands, 7 satellite dishes, 3 armor-plated batteries, 8 dish antennas and 180 tape cassettes. He gets his supplies in Bamako and brings them to his store in Sikasso, which is located at the bus station, right next to the office of the travel company K\u00e8n\u00e8dougou Voyage.

She lives in her own house with her husband, Eleuterio, 53, and her 17-year-old son, Rub\u00e9n.  Her greatest wish is that her family have a happy life.  Her business is located in a highly commercial area of her city and she is convinced that the variety of her products increase her sales so she makes a special effort to keep her designs unique in the clothing she weaves.  What she most likes about her work is the weaving itself; she enjoys doing it very much and her state of mind is reflected in the finishes she gives her work.  She has had this occupation for 10 years.  The most difficult part of the work is transporting the finished items to her sales stall because the bundles are very heavy.  For further into the future, she would like to establish a large store from which to sell woven handicrafts and where she can sell her clothing items more peacefully.  This is Evangelina's second loan with MFP and she has discovered the value inherent in working in a group.  She is confident that she will repay her loan on time and not cause her communal bank any problems where she is very well-liked for the joy she expresses.

Married to Albert Houessou, a motorcycle electrician, Blanche has two children, both in school. Blanche has lived together with her husband and children for nine years in the Cococodji area, close to Cotonou. Blanche ended her education in secondary school. Only Blanche's husband provides for the family. For seven years, Blanche has run a business selling fabric, bags, and shoes through the distribution system. Blanche gets her supplies in Lom\u00e9, the capital of Togo, a country bordering Benin. Blanche has already benefited from one loan through ALID\u00c9 (one of Kiva's field partners), which she repaid properly. To further increase the size of her business and better satisfy her clientele with the upcoming holiday season, Blanche is seeking a second loan through ALID\u00c9.

She has two children who are 4 and 1 year old.  With income generated from her store she is able to help her husband meet some of the household expenses.  Wendy stated that the funding is needed to restock her store so that her sales and profits will increase despite the losses suffered the last few months due to the situation the country is undergoing.  Still, things are beginning to improve little by little.

What little she can save goes to cover certain household and personal expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Zal Bilimoria, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":429943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase of rice, sugar, butter, soap, salt, coffee, seasonings, corn and wheat flour, instant soups, juices, churros, margarine and eggs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T22:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Henry ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":669.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110753151,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":669.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118142205,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":669.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123979596,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":669.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129010608,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:47Z","rounded_local_amount":669.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136734972,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":669.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144768431,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":669.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152085890,"comment":null},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T09:17:00Z","rounded_local_amount":669.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159799755,"comment":null},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":669.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166904928,"comment":null},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":1999.97,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2008.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172172829,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Her first two are married and live independently and the last two are students at the Guillermo Mensi school in Valle.  Her  husband is a carpenter and they live in their own home.  Mar\u00eda has raised chickens for the past 3 years and she comments that she does well selling her chickens in the community and to neighbors who come to her house to buy them.  She gets along well with all the other members of the bank.  This is her first loan with the foundation which she was encouraged to request by a girlfriend.  As she says:  due to lack of funds one always must look for resources to be able to continue working.  With the loan from ESPOIR she will buy young chicks and chicken feed.  Her goal is to see her children succeed at their work and become professionals.  Mrs. Carmen P., 48, is also a member of the bank.  She is a single mother of three children who are 26, 22 and 10 years old.  Her eldest daughter is married and lives independently elsewhere; her second oldest works and helps her mother with utility payments and her youngest son is a student at the Tomas Rend\u00f3n school.  Thanks to the strength of her efforts she has managed to build her own house.  Carmen sells prepared meals.  She slaughters a pig and prepares delicious pork stew and fried pork dishes.  She also roasts chickens and guinea pigs.  She has had this work for the past 15 years and does well  producing earnings to sustain her household.  She gets along well with all the other members of the bank.  This is her first loan and she was encouraged to solicit it by a member of the community.  She will use some of the financing  from ESPOIR to invest in her business, some to  buy school supplies for her son and the rest to buy food for her home.  Her goal is to improve her house because it is currently made of adobe (wood and straw bricks).<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

He works in this business with his brother, who is very good, and together it is easier to solve the problems of their clients. Previously he worked transporting passengers, but it did not go well. Now with his new activity he is very satisfied because he can put into practice the experience he acquired with each one of the motorcycles that he repairs. His workshop is very popular, since his clients recommend them to other people due to the good work that they do. \r\n\r\nThis is their first loan with  MFP, an affiliate of Kiva. He is very enthusiastic because he has good references about the communal banks and the partners of the group who are responsible people and very communicative.

This place is known for its craftwork in weaving and also for archeological sites like Cauzhin and Tambo de Marivi\u00f1a, which attract national and foreign tourists alike. The community bank consists of a group of businesswomen who have forged a solid friendship while always looking to improve their families and community bank. Rosario C. is an active member of this community bank. She lives in Cumbe, is 54 years old, married and has three children, ages 33, 30 and 20. Her eldest daughter has her own family and lives at home, while the other two migrated abroad in search of better days for themselves and their parents. Her husband is a construction worker, and with everyone's efforts they were able to build their home. Rosario dedicates herself to households chores and also raises animals like chickens, guinea pigs, pigs, sheep and cows, which produce milk that she delivers to neighbors in her community. She raises the animals as much for her family to eat as to sell them.

She has three sewing machines, one for embroidering and the other for straight stitch and zigzag. She employs one person who is in charge of gem embroidery for wedding and quincea\u00f1era gowns. One wedding gown is worth 300 dollars, depending on what she has to invest in each one.

Her eldest son is married and lives on his own. Her other children are still in school. None of the children know their father, and he also doesn't help them economically, so Delfina is in charge of providing for her family. They do not have their own home and live in a borrowed house where they only pay for basic services (electricity and water). Delfina sells roasted pork Tuesdays and Saturday in Cumbe's central plaza, and Wednesdays and Friday she sells coffee and empanadas at the livestock fair. She has 15 years' experience and tells us things are going well. Delfina says she joined the community bank a year ago, had to withdraw because of situations out of her control, and then returned. She is now in her second loan cycle, and with the loan she is requesting from Kiva partner Fundacion Espoir, she plans to use a portion to purchase pork, flour, lard, oil, etc. to make her meals, and to use the other part for her children's education.

This bank is located in the Cumbe parish in the southeast part of the city of Cuenca.

She can't remember all of their ages, but six of them are now married. She owns her own home and lives with her ailing husband and their two youngest children, aged 18 and 15. Because of her economic situation they haven't been able to go to school and they can only work when a family friend can hire them temporarily. \r\nMaria works raising chickens, guinea pigs, and hogs which she sells in the local markets. She also grows vegetables for home consumption and for sale to neighbours and markets. With the loan requested from Fundacion Espoir, she will buy chicks, guinea pigs and lambs to increase her animal raising business.

Manta is a tourist coastal town that is visited by many from all over the country and abroad.

She lives in the San Pedro neighborhood, in the Manta canton with her 15-year-old daughter. She is a nurse and she has worked in a health center for a year. She also has a business selling all manner of basic supplies for the home and other seasonal products. When school starts, she sells school supplies; during the holiday season, she sells ornaments and trees; and during carnival, she sells soft drinks. She has had her store for five years.

She is 45 years old. Corazon is married and has 8 school-aged children. To make a living, Corazon owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing repair services to local community members. Corazon has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Corazon joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Corazon has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. Corazon is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Corazon from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

And she hopes that they will continue for a long time and aid many families and enterprising women. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":430156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"TO BUY GROCERIES IN ORDER TO AUGMENT HER PRODUCTS FOR SALE","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:01:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":266.66,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":286.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727843,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":143.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118229,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:13Z","rounded_local_amount":143.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953940,"comment":null},{"amount":49.99,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":143.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987006,"comment":null},{"amount":50.01,"local_amount":133.35,"processed_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":143.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713126,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-11T02:37:06Z","paid_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":154575,"name":"Magdalena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Magdalena T. is married, 67 years old, and has 5  adult children.

She is married, 52 years old, and is the mother of 5 children, one of whom is still a dependent.  Nicida has maD. undergarments for 4 years, and little by little she was generating her own income and saving her money, wanting to have her own workshop.  With her skills in sewing she had no doubt that she could do it, and with the support of the Movimiento Manuela Ramos organization she was able to accomplish this.  She tells us that it is going very well; she works on orders that her customers place in advance.  She attends to them with characteristic friendliness and charisma.  With this loan of 1,500 soles nuevos she will buy meters of fabric in different types and colors, tools such as scissors, thread on large spools in a variety of colors, needles for hand and machine sewing, pins and buttons.  Today she feels like a very accomplished woman, with a desire to continue to reach for her goals and make her other dreams a reality.  She is grateful to the Movimiento Manuela Ramos organization for helping her start her business, and also for helping many women who want to grow as entrepreneurs. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":430159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"to buy dressmaking supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:01:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:44Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727844,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":251.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118230,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":251.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953941,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":251.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987007,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":251.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713127,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-11T07:36:58Z","paid_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":154578,"name":"Nenita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nenita R. is married, 63 years old, and has 6  adult children.

H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,578,000 VND from SEDA, which was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 6,322,000 VND, which will also be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell. This loan will be the fifth loan she has taken out from SEDA.

B. who lives in the village of Brgy. Patic, Pulupandan Negros Occidental,is 50 years old, and married to Jersom who is a fisherman. The couple have 2 children who are 14 and 20 years old. \r\n<p>\r\nJulie works hard to help her husband improve their living situation and send their children to school so that they will have a brighter future.\r\n<p>\r\nJulie believes that the family should come first before anything else; that\u2019s why she is doing everything to improve their life by providing proper nutrition and education to her children. When she got married she decided to help her husband by selling his catch within their village and even up to the nearby towns. \r\n<p>\r\nShe was so good at selling fish that demand from her regular customers grew, prompting her to think of expanding both her husband's fishing venture as well as her own operations. So she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 so that she could purchase additional fishing gear for her husband and have access to more capital for her fish vending business.\r\n<p>\r\nBusiness did not always stay up - through the years, Julie and her husband encountered ups and downs in their business but she never lost hope and held on to her dreams for her family - the one motivating factor that made her go on in spite of the hurdles they encountered.\r\n<p>\r\nNow, her business is more stable and she earns a monthly average income of 12,000 PHP which is quite sufficient for her family's household expenses with some left over for savings.\r\n<p>\r\nJulie\u2019s previous loan of 19,500 PHP was utilized as additional capital for her fish vending and fishing business. The loan was fully repaid on time and in full without delay. For her 13th loan cycle she is borrowing the same amount to buy additional fishing nets for the fishing venture and to have working capital for her fish vending business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the picture, Julie and her husband Jersom pose with their fishing boat and some of the catch which she will sell.\r\n<em><p>\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n<\/em><p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":427216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Additional

She is married and has 3 adult-aged children. To making a living, T. operates a family member's manufacturing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from manufacturing and selling products to local businesses and community members. T. has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately 3.500.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2.204.000 VND from SEDA. She used the previous loan to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. T. is now requesting a new loan of 4.142.000 VND, which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products.  The loan will be the third loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA. T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About SEDA<\/b>\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Note<\/b>: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nT. \u0110\u00e0o Th\u1ecb (10107070005) l\u00e0 51 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

Battulga is 47 years old and lives with his wife and four children in a house in Uvs province, Mongolia. His oldest son and daughter are both  university students and his youngest son and daughter attend local secondary schools. \r\n<p>\r\nBattulga manages a meat and animal fat oil trading business in his town with the help of his wife. He sells a variety of meats and fat oil which he makes from the internal organs of animals. Animal fat oil is a popular product among residents who live far from the market and can't make frequent trips into town. They use it to make everyday foods such as buns and to fry potatoes.

Bolinchuluun is 51 years old and lives with her husband and three children in Tuv Province in central Mongolia. Her oldest son is currently serving in the Mongolian military and her youngest daughter attends a local secondary school. Bolinchuluun operates a grocery trading business out of a rented stall at the local market in her town. She started her business in 1999, with capital of 500,000 tugrugs (~350 USD), and has built a stable business over the last 10 years. Today, she has much experience as a businesswoman and has a great reputation among her many customers and suppliers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This loan will benefit him as well as the family that he loves so much.\r\n<em><p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<em><p>\r\nIMON's History<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<em><p>\r\nIMON's History<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in his own home in Boane with his family and supports 4 more people who live in his house as well.  He left Chibuto for Maputo during the war as a way to find refuge.  He ended up staying in Boane until now.  He has had his own business for more than 15 years, where he works along with his wife from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m.  He learned this work in South Africa when he was employed in a store.  He sells alcoholic beverages and makes an income of around 1,000 meticais per day.  He puts away savings every month in his account in the Millennium Bim bank.  He has never had a loan with another credit institution.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through his mother-in-law, who is also a client with this institution.  This is his third loan, and it is in the amount of 20,000 meticais.  He will use it to acquire products for his business (beer, wine, soft drinks, and basic goods) as a way to respond to his customers' demands.  His previous loans were for 6,500 and 15,000 meticais, both for the same purpose.  He has a goal of increasing his merchandise so he can consequently increase his income.  In the future, he would like to request more loans to construct his house and to furnish it. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

She is separated and the mother of 3 three children, who are 13, 10, and 4.  The oldest ones go to school.  She studied through 10th grade and later continued studying to be a teacher in the Instituto de Magist\u00e9rio Prim\u00e1rio in Matola.  She lives in her own home with her children and doesn't support anyone else besides them.  She never moved from the city where she lives.  After her separation, she continued living with her children, and she works as a teacher for the Ministry of Education.  She earns a salary of 7,600 meticais per month.  With the help of a subsidy that the father of her children sends her every month, she feeds her family and saves some in her bank account.  She has never had a loan with another bank.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through her colleagues, and this is her 3rd loan.  It is for 20,500 meticais and she will use it to buy construction materials (doors, windows, cement, etc.) to improve her home.  Her previous loans were also used for this purpose.  She hopes to request more loans in the future to be able to finish her home, to buy furniture, and to offer better living conditions to her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She is 37; married; and has 5 children who are 17, 11, 8, 4, and 1.  The oldest ones go to school.  She studied through 6th grade and had to stop going to school due to her parents' lack of financial resources.  This year she returned to school and is going to the 7th grade.  She lives in her own home with her family.  She also supports her nieces and\/or nephews who live with her.  After she got married, she left Manjacaze for Maputo in 1998 with her husband, who works at the National Road Directive as an inspector.  She is a merchant and has owned her own business for more than 3 years.  She doesn't have employees and only has the help of two of her children.  From this business, she receives a daily profit of 500 meticais.  With the help of the salary of her husband, which is 10,698 meticais a month, she manages to save some in the Barclays bank.  She hasn't had a loan at other banks.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through her friend, Maria Ndlate, who is also a client of the institution.  This is her third loan, and it is for 15,000 meticais.  She will use it to purchase construction materials (metal sheets and bars) to continue putting a roof on her home.  Her previous loans were for 9,000 and 10,000 meticais, which were both used for the same purpose.

She is 51; single, and the mother of 3 children who are 35, 32, and 25.  None of them goes to school.   She didn't go to school because her parents didn't have the financial resources to send her.  She lives in her own home with her family and also supports 2 grandchildren who live with her.  She left the province of Gaza for Maputo in 1987 in search of better living conditions after the death of president Samora Machel.  Afterwards, she constructed her home in neighborhood 5 in Boane in the province of Maputo.  She has had her own business selling basic goods for more than 3 years.  She also practices traditional medicine, which is known as curandeira.  With these activities, she make a monthly profit of 5,000 meticais, which she uses to support her family.  She also saves some every month through a traditional rotating savings program.  She has never had a loan with another insitution.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through a friend.  This is her 7th loan, and it is for 15,000 meticais.  She will use it purchase merchandise (rice, margarine, sugar, peanuts, etc.) to respond to market demand.  Her previous loans ( 4 for 15,000 meticais, 1 for 10,000 meticais, 1 for 5,000 meticais, and 1 for 2,500 meticais) went towards her business and housing needs.  In the future, she hopes to request more loans to construct a shelter of conventional materials as a way of guaranteeing the safety and freshness of her products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":524.61,"image":{"id":430547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy and sell various food products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T01:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.39,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonor Elija","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":659.14},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":688.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":720.08},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":752.63},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":786.65},{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":822.21},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":859.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":898.23},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":938.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":981.28},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1025.64},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1072},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1120.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1171.11},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1224.05},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1279.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.07},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.53},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.86},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.21},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.99},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":65.35,"local_amount":1867.12,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1904.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709070,"comment":null},{"amount":233.39,"local_amount":6668.38,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6803.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938187,"comment":null},{"amount":163.22,"local_amount":4663.5,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-21T07:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4757.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938188,"comment":null},{"amount":62.65,"local_amount":1801,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1837.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.39,"payment_id":128972056,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T06:37:01Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":154812,"name":"United We Stand Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mark K. is a leader of a group of 5 borrowers called United We Stand.

(greetings) from Tanzania!

She works at her business for between nine and twelve hours per day, six days per week. She currently earns about $100 USD from her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":430570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough, wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot, sticky dough made from maize flour), and plantain (a cooked, savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. Eni works at the business for between nine and twelve hours per day, seven days per week, and currently earns about $90 USD from her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":430577,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To improve the quality of her business premises","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eni  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":71906.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757727,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":71906.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146821,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":71906.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984966,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":71906.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015639,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":71906.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740645,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":71906.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773759,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-03T20:48:03Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":154823,"name":"Fanice Imali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fanice is 51 years old and widowed with one son.

is a 29-year-old man who lives in the Bekaa with his wife and their four children. Achraf has been working as a furniture painter for almost two years. Achraf requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to purchase some tools and a car for his work. This is his second loan cycle and he has always paid on time. \r\n\r\nAchraf is special in his work because he has a lot of skills and always does nice and precise work.

B., 52, lives with his wife and their three children in a community called  Cimarr\u00f3n de Santa Teresita de Turrialba in the Cartago province.  It is a small, rural community with approximately 2,000 inhabitants.  The population works in milk production and farming.  The landscape is irregular, and much of the land is humid tropical rain forest.  Cimarr\u00f3n is located approximately one and a half hours by bus from Turrialba, the closest commercial center.  However, several times a year the road becomes impassable because of the rains.\r\n\r\nAbel is a milk producer.  At this time he wishes to get a loan for \u00a2500.000 (five hundred thousand colones) to buy one more dairy cow to increase production.  He knows that having another cow is a big sacrifice, and that it will demand more work. He says that if he wants to get his family ahead, he needs to make the effort to produce more.\r\n\r\nHe does his work in a place equipped to milk.  He says that he produces approximately 80 liters of milk a day.  With an additional cow his production would increase to 100 liters daily.  That is why he is very excited to be able to see how his business grows and gets stronger.\r\n\r\nAbel is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Nuevas Esperanzas para Cimarr\u00f3n (the New Hope for Cimmar\u00f3n Communal Bank), one of the 100 member organizations of Edesa in Costa Rica.  This will be his second loan.  With the loan he hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level.  He will also actively participate in the credit organization in his community.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

This is a semi-mountainous area and its economic activities focus on agriculture and, principally, cattle ranching.  The community offers great opportunities to develop and establish micro-enterprises in both agro-industry and commerce.\r\n<p>\r\nVilma has had her own business, a small grocery store, for 4 years.  She sells basic products to her neighbors.  The store has proven to be profitable and it's the only source of income she has.  It has helped improve her family's quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nAt present, she needs a loan of 600,000 colons to buy more merchandise and increase her inventory.  Specifically, she wants to buy basics such as rice, beans, vegetables, canned goods, soft drinks, soap, sweets, and all that may be found in the rural Costa Rican's basic basket.  Vilma comments that the service she offers is very important since no other grocery store exists in the zone and as a result, she has many customers.\r\n<p>\r\nVilma is a member of the Canalete Community Credit Enterprise, one of the 100 organizations belonging to EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her first loan and she hopes to continue growing at the personal and economic level, as well as to participate actively in the credit organization in her community.<br
