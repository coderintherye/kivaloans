Pheap K. is a 29-year-old who has three children, all of whom still young, and they live in Ptasrong Commune, Pursat Province. Her husband, Mr. Saov Shon, is 28 years old. They are both local farmers who grow rice and vegetables for revenue to buy food for their kids to eat.

","en":" Shodigul S. lives in the Huroson District. She is 49 years old. Her family is very large; she is married and has eight children. For the past seven years she has been raising livestock. She finishes - buys, fattens, and resells - cattle. Now she wants to increase the number of animals by buying a pure-bred bull calf. To do that she decided to take out an 18-month loan. This will improve her business and help her to further develop it.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva

Indeed, for the past eight years, she has been selling beans and maize to support her family. She treks to farming communities to buy her stock of beans and maize from farmers; by doing so, she avoids dealing with middlemen, who buy from the farmers and resell to her at higher prices. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is currently seeking a loan to buy beans and maize in bulk to meet the daily demands of her customers.

Having a stock of that feed will result in well finished animals. To do this he contacted us about receiving a loan. The loan will be repaid over 12 months. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":229086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Complete feed supply","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Vakhsh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"37.710833 68.831111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Snat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3500,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":291.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":583.34,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":595.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10230621,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20428626,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27122403,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36017765,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:25:46Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44601809,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52996382,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T17:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63217605,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T20:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73646923,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T00:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87086351,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-18T09:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":297.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97002125,"comment":null},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":291.63,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-20T09:22:38Z","rounded_local_amount":297.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846993,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-06T19:39:58Z","paid_date":"2009-12-20T09:22:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":75716,"name":"Golib","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Golib U. is 36 years old and lives with his wife and two children in Spitamen in Tajikistan.

A. is a 32-year-old married woman with two children. To earn a living, she has been a trader for the past seven years; in particular, she sells used clothes in the local market of Tema. With income from her business, Florence is able to support all of her children in junior high school. <p>\r\n\r\nHer major business challenge over the years is her lack of funding, which prevents her from scaling up the business. She has a great deal of marketing experience, so she is very confident that she can improve the business with an injection of capital. As such, she is seeking a loan to enable her to achieve remarkable business progress. Specifically, she would use the loan proceeds to buy more bales of used clothes to meet her customers' demands.

She has been running these businesses under one roof in a stall she rents in Bulwa zone.<p>\r\n\r\nShe is 38 years old, married and the loving mother of six children aged 15 years to 5 months, of whom 5 are in school. When she tired of being a housewife 5 years ago, her husband and a driver with Lake Victoria environmental management, helped her raise capital for both businesses. She has hence kept her businesses going by providing excellent customer care to her clients and maintaining good hygiene at her stall.<p> \r\n\r\nThis is Victo\u2019s 2nd loan with BRAC Uganda and she hopes it will help her business grow, thereby increasing profits. With such financial progress, she looks forward to supporting her husband in raising funds for the purchase a plot of land and construction of their residence.

Now they work for themselves and reap the full reward for their labor.  Starting very early in the morning, they both work hard making bricks, something that requires several steps.  It takes 4 days to make thousands.  It's a profitable business but seasonal and sales vary depending on the time of year.  Sales increase substantially in March and April and, though the work is hard, those months are a good source of income that inspire the family to go on with the business.

She sells them to bigger businesses, a good option for her now that she's moved from the country to the city.  Her only source of income before was farming but now she has the weaving business which has helped her to pay for her youngest daughter's education.  Despite having lived in the city for some time, she still works at farming, growing potatoes and maize, which she takes to market for sale at harvest time.  The harvest only rolls around every 6 months, though, and the weaving business provides her with a fixed income.  She truly enjoys her work.

Also included in his dreams is to have his own motorcycle so he can have something to use whenever he is required to take photos in far places where his customers asked him to go.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHe has a lot of plans for his business but he must do it step by step and he believes that with faith, hard work and perseverance all will take place.

Besides these children, he lives with and is responsible for two grandchildren.\r\n\r\nSalom\u00e3o studied until 4th grade and stopped because at that time, they were not allowed further study, except in some zones.

Angelica attended school up until the 5th grade only because she got pregnant and had to move to her own place. She always lived in the same city with her parents before getting pregnant. Angelica makes her living purchasing bales of used shoes and selling them at retail prices; she has one employee, and she has been in business for over 15 years. These bales are purchased for 3800,00mt each; they contain 50 pairs of used shoes, and each pair can be sold for 350,00mt. Everyday she might earn between 2500,00mt and 3000,00mt. This will be the first time Angelica is requesting a loan fro Hluvuku and Kiva. She wishes to pay it back early so that she can apply for a second loan that will be used to speed up construction of her house to better accommodate her kids, and to further expand her business. <br

She is 36 years old, a widow and mother of a 6 year-old son. Also living with her are her mother and a sister - she provides for both of them as well. Her father's passing when she was very young created financial difficulties for the family, and Virginia had to drop out of the school while on the 8th grade. Unfortunately, in 2007, after 10 years of marriage, she also lost her husband. Virginia makes her living by selling chickens, and a small variety of assorted articles, without help from additional employees. She is able to purchase these small articles for 80 rands (200,00mt) and sell them for 420,00mt, generating a monthly income of 10000,00mt. This is Virginia's second loan request from Hluvuku and the first through Kiva. She applied the whole loan amount of 15000,00mt from the first loan in her business. Ultimately, she wants to fulfill her dreams: make improvements to better accommodate her family and help her business grow further.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice,

that they have obtained for various purposes. Mr. Thavy A. is the village bank president who has been selected by the members. He is a farmer who owns a plot of land used to cultivate rice and earn income. As well as running this business, he is also a palm juice collector. His wife, Mrs. Let Phal Len, is a pig breeder. Since her business is going well, she wants to expand it. Therefore, Mr. Thavy A. decided to ask for a loan to buy two piglets to add to his wife\u2019s breeding stock. He hopes to increase their income and improve his living conditions with this loan. Mr. Thavy A. does not have children. \r\n\r\n<p>This is a group loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Three members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.

Due to her old age, Ni Nyoman Dendi decided she would make Praying materials from her home. She makes and also buy from other housewives, which she would then later be sold to a local trader. Due to limited capital, she is facing problems.  However with the help of Dinari, she hope that her 8 year old businees will grow.

With previous loans, she opened a veterinary office in her house which provides her husband with employment.  With her share of this loan she will invest in the veterinary office and will also continue raising animals.  Her family\u2019s life has gradually improved and she is very grateful to the Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be split equally between all six borrowers with each member of the group borrowing 1,626,900 Vietnamese Dong, or just under US$100.  The other borrowers in the group will use their share of the loan as follows:\r\n\r\n* Mrs. Minh Nguyen Thi is borrowing money to buy vegetables from farmers that she will resell at market.\r\n* Mrs. Chieu Hoang Thi is borrowing money to buy and raise chickens and ducks.\r\n* Mrs. Tham Bui Thi is borrowing money to invest in her tailoring business.\r\n* Mrs. Tinh Pham Thi is borrowing money to buy fertilizer and for growing vegetables.\r\n* Mrs. Huyen Pham Thi is borrowing money to buy pig meat to make a very popular food in Thanh Hoa province that she will sell to restaurants and street vendors.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":227105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Veterinary Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Veterinary sales and agricultural products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Viet Nam","town":"Thanh Ho\u00e1","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":121,"posted_date":"2008-11-24T23:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"T\u00fa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Th\u1eafm","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"T\u00ecnh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chi\u00eau","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Huy\u1ec1n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":9761400,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T04:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1633814.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5316002,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1633814.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9934161,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:18:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1633814.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14857987,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1633814.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20398704,"comment":null},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1633814.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27090630,"comment":null},{"amount":95.85,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1633814.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35983998,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-25T09:32:06Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:14:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":75938,"name":"Rosie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosie S. is a 54-year-old widow living at Biasong, Lopez Jaena Misamis Occidental, 19 kilometers from Oroquieta City, where she sells her fresh fish.

Each time she renewed for a greater amount and has not defaulted; therefore, she is a member in good standing.  As the wife of a fisherman, she used to sell fish from her husband\u2019s catch. Now that she is a widow, she tries her best to cope with the present demands of her children, especially with four of the seven still studying (two are in their college years).  Because of financial constraints, one of her children decided to stop her college studies to allow her sister, who is in her senior years and soon to graduate, to continue to pursue her studies. \r\n\r\nAt present, Rosie is still engaged in the fish vending business.  She applied for loan at Paglaum amounting to twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00) for additional capital for her recent business.  This amount is very helpful in purchasing enough fish to supply the Lopez Jaena Public Market, and some for delivery to Oroquieta City. An expected return of income will be materialized.  Her average net income per day ranges from Php 300 to Php 700.\r\n\r\nRosie aspires to someday become a fish broker.  And her utmost ambition is to send her remaining unmarried children to college.

We consider her  a member in good standing (MIGS). She applied for a loan amounting to Php 20,000.00. This is mainly for the additional capital for the purchase of \u201clahoy\u201d.

Hamidova lives in the Bokhtar District. As a businesswoman, she has been in sales for 7 years. She sells fruits and vegetables at the district's food market.

She then just contented herself looking after the house and help her husband in his farming chores.To while away her time she decided to join PMPC and got deeply involved in its community activities. She was even able to organize a group of women in her village to develop their entrepreneurial capacities. \n\nAfter undergoing a series of training conducted by PMPC on how to become an entrepreneur and manage household finances, she then renovated the frontage of her house and converted it into a small retail shop. She was able to do this using a start-up loan of PHP 2,000 from PMPC. Her little business gradually grew and after two years she was able to increase her working capital to PHP 20,000. She is now able to earn an income of her own and not depend so much on the meager income from the farm of her husband. While the couple is childless, Melinda has focused her attention on leading the group of women entrepreneurs she organized in her village and help them succeed in their ventures.\n\nRecords of PMPC would show that for 15 loan cycles, Melinda has no record of default, and she was able to maintain her Member In Good Standing status. Her husband also helps her business when he is not on the farm.  \n\nHer knowledge about how to handle customers properly helped her gain additional regular clients and increase the demand for her goods. Now she is applying for a loan worth PHP 20,000 for the purchase of additional stocks to further expand her retail shop.\n\nThe couple\u2019s future plan is to increase their business assets so that they can build a concrete sari-sari store to protect their stocks. They also have plans to renovate their house, as it is only made of light

When they decided to marry, they agreed to live in Severino\u2019s hometown. Arlene\u2019s primary income is from her \u201ccarinderia,\u201d a mini eatery.  Severino is a carpenter. \r\n\r\nArlene is one of the pioneer Paglaum Coop members. She joined when the program was introduced in Lopez Jaena in 1997. She has taken out five loans with this group.\r\n\r\nArlene lives near Mindanao State University-Lopez Jaena, which offers classes from the primary grades through high school. Many of her customers are students, teachers, and fisherfolks. Now Arlene is requesting a loan of Php 15,000 ($325 USD) so she can buy supplies for her carinderia and add new menu items that her customers have requested. \r\n\r\nArlene is hoping that through this loan she can increase her income, enhance her carinderia, and purchase a door lock for the carinderia.  She also wants to buy a refrigerator so she won\u2019t have to rent a freezer from her neighbor anymore.  The income from the carinderia is of great help to her family, especially in times when her husband has no work.  Arlene is very thankful for Paglaum.

She is 46 years old and married to Juanito, a devoted and brave fisherman. The couple was blessed with two children and both of them have settled down.\r\n\r\nMr. Juanito once worked with their neighbor who had a fishing boat. He had a small share of the fishing income, but it was not enough for the whole family. Meriam happened to become a Paglaum Co-op member when one of their neighbors (a co-op member too) sold the couple Paglaum\u2019s programs and services five years ago. The couple was so thankful for Paglaum because they were granted enough money to purchase machinery for their own fishing boat. From then on, Meriam's husband no longer worked with their neighbor, but focused on his own fishing boat and has reaped their income from it. While her husband is focusing on fishing, Mrs. A. is also vending snacks, ice candy, ice, and bar-b-que in their neighborhood to provide additional income for the family. Bar- b-que is a kind of thinly sliced pork or any meat attached to a bamboo stick and grilled. It has a minimal selling price of only two to five pesos and is very affordable to the market.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the couple has acquired three unit motorized pump boats and is applying for a loan worth fifteen thousand pesos (P15,000.00) for the acquisition of another fishing boat which is bigger and better than what they have now.  According to them, the bigger the boat is, the more it can fight big waves, can run through even during stormy season, and can transport and hold a number of huge fish caught at sea. An average of fifty kilos per day is their daily sales from one unit motorized pump boat, with an average of forty pesos (P40) selling price per kilo, depending on the type and variety of fish. \r\n\r\nThe couple was so grateful for Paglaum MPC because through the co-op they were able to build a partially concrete house. The couple hopes for more blessings to come as they faithfully maintain their Member In Good Standing status with the co-op and pay their loans on time with no trace of default. The family is dreaming of having a \u201clantsa\u201d, a much bigger fishing boat with at least 20 workers so that they can fish from coast to coast in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":229962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase

With the rice revenue, she not only cannot support her household, but she also cannot afford to buy another piece of land to cultivate more rice. Therefore, she decided to ask for a loan for this purpose. With this loan, she hopes to increase her income and improve her living conditions within a few months.

It\u2019s a big help in their family but still insufficient for their basic necessities.  \r\n\r\nSusette is now asking for a loan of P20,000 to provide additional capital for her sari-sari store, particularly for the purchase of assorted canned goods, spices, toiletries, rice and many other items. This additional capital will surely have a return of at least 300 per day.\r\n\r\nSusette has a simple dream for her family: to become a successful business woman in her sari-sari store, for her children to finish their studies, and to have a happy family.

She currently rents her market stall, but if the business develops well after she receives the loan, she plans to buy her own space. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":230028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"Increase Sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gissar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.524722 68.551389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazokat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":333.34,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":340.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10230633,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20428638,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27122415,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36017777,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44601821,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52996393,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T17:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":170.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63217616,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T20:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73646934,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T00:25:58Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87086362,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-19T09:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97002134,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.63,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-21T09:23:48Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103847002,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-11T18:49:22Z","paid_date":"2009-12-21T09:23:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":76020,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary O. is 50 years old and married with 7 children.

This was the time she needed money to finance the bakery and decided to join Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative in 2006. She has requested a loan amounting to PHP 20,000. The purpose of the loan is to buy additional sacks of flour and sandwich-slicer equipment in order to increase the volume of production. Paglaum MPC has also helped her to save a part of her income for future use, aside from its other benefits like insurance and dividends. With God's help and hard work, her business is going so well that she was able to send her son to college and purchased some baking equipment.<P>\r\n\r\nMrs. E. plans to undertake major renovations on her bakeshop, extend its eat-in area, and have a presentable bakeshop in the future. She also plans to send her bakers to attend a training course for new technologies and baking techniques so as to be competitive.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":230032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"to purchase sacks of flour, sugar, and other ingredients for bread-making and buy sandwich-slicer equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Ilaya, Dapitan City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":"2008-11-25T22:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":17,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:35:08Z","rounded_local_amount":832.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5343524,"comment":null},{"amount":153,"local_amount":7200,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":7496.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14881392,"comment":null},{"amount":255,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":12493.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53000747,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-26T01:15:06Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T23:17:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":76070,"name":"Anna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anna is married and has one child.
