Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janyl is the leader of this group. Her divorce has made her a stronger woman and a better mother. She is doing her best to provide for her only son, a school student. As a divorced woman she receives child compensation in amount of four and half dollars a month from the government. So Janyl cannot depend on or ask help from anybody. Now she has to rely on herself. \r\n<p>\r\nEven though she is forty-three years old, her age has not prevented her from making a major change in her life. About two months ago a friend of hers went to trade in another market and left her stall to Janyl. Janyl, who had never done trading before, gave up her former occupation and decided to take a risk. She invested all her money, $700, in women\u2019s clothing and started selling. Very soon the sales started to go well, and she has been able to increase her turnover up to $535. Now she is making $200 a month. \r\n<p>\r\nHer son also helps her run the stall after school. Janyl is teaching him some basic lessons of survival, giving him a chance to earn his own pocket money. Janyl has applied for this loan to purchase more goods, mainly women's seasonal clothes. She is eager to work hard and increase the turnover. She wants to buy a more profitable spot for the stall. \r\n\r\nThese are Janyl\u2019s partners: Aftandil, Jumabubu and Jyrgalbubu. Aftandil, 31, has two daughters. Aftandil\u2019s relative has suggested that she set up in business. This relative trades in bedclothes. So Aftandil has decided to obtain this loan and purchase bedclothes for resale.\r\n \r\nJumabubu, 48, is divorced and has one son. Her husband is temporarily unemployed, so Jumabubu supports her family by selling foodstuffs. She needs a loan to purchase goods, mainly foodstuffs.\r\n \r\nJyrgalbubu, 45, is a widow and has one thirteen-year-old daughter. Jyrgalbubu is engaged in sewing. She makes traditional articles and takes them in to some shops. She needs a loan to purchase fabric at \u201cMadina\u201d market, since fabric is cheaper there.\r\n \r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulnara, the leader of this group, used to work as a schoolteacher. Her teacher\u2019s salary was far less than sufficient, even for basic survival. She believed that there had to be another way of life, a more deserving one. Gulnara made a choice toward improving her life even though she knew that it would require some sacrifice. \r\n<p>\r\nSeven years ago she convinced her husband to sell their car. She invested the proceeds, about $1050, into setting up a business. She started trading in foodstuffs (candies, biscuits, canned food and cereals) in her own stall at a city market. Her family's quality of life has indeed improved. She is making $350 a month, which is one-third of the car\u2019s selling price. Besides being able to pay for their children\u2019s education, they have been able to buy a car, to open another shop near their house, and to put a refrigerator, a freezer and a rack in the shop . \r\n<p>\r\nGulnara has three children. Her husband still works at the school. Her son, 19, works as an electrician. Another son goes to a law school. Their daughter, 14, goes to school, and after school she substitutes for her mother. \r\n<p>\r\nGulnara wants to obtain a loan to purchase cereals, candies and vegetable oil, and to buy some winter clothes for winter trade.  She is making plans about expanding her shop and making changes to attract more customers. \r\n\r\nGulnara\u2019s partners are: Gulnura, Shaiymkul, Anarkan and Gulnara.\r\nGulnura, 36, has two children. Her husband is a welder and Gulnura helps him support the family by selling milk. Gulnura needs a loan to purchase two sheep and a calf and to put up new gates. \r\n\r\nShaiymkul, 58, is a farmer\u2019s wife. They have three children. Shaiymkul keeps some cattle and sells milk. Shaiymkul hopes to obtain a loan and buy a calf and with the rest of the loan harvest the clover. \r\n\r\nAnarkan, 46, has four children. She is a housewife and sells milk. Anarkan needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nGulnara, 46, has two children. Currently she is busy harvesting crops: clover, corn, pumpkin and sugar beets. She needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Her eldest son, 31, lives in another town and her daughter, 29, is married and lives separately as well. Another son, 26, is married and lives with his family. Only her youngest son, 20, is still single and lives with her. To earn her daily bread, Rosa occupies herself with cattle breeding. She manages to make some extra money from selling milk and also works part time as a guard. From time to time she produces cottage cheese and sour cream and also sells it to local villagers. Rosa brought up her children doing this same job, and continues to work hard even though her children are now able to support themselves. Rosa\u2019s total earnings amount to 70 US dollars. It is the way of life she has gotten used to, including receiving enjoyment from breeding cattle. Now, Rosa needs a loan to buy a calf for breeding. She is already awaiting grandchildren and making arrangements to marry her youngest son. \r\n<p>\r\nRosa\u2019s partners are: Erkinbek, Elmira and Venera. Erkinbek, 55, is a father of five children. All his children are grown-up and earn their living themselves. He works as a security guard at a car station and raises livestock. Erkinbek wants to increase the total population of his cattle and hopes that by obtaining a loan he will be able to buy several sheep. \r\n<p>\r\nElmira, 54, has mothered four children. She is a widow. To make a living she is engaged in poultry farming. Her son, 29, works as a car maintainer and another son does odd jobs at a brick producing factory. Her daughter has recently gotten married. Her youngest son is a senior at high school. Elmira needs a loan to prepare her daughter\u2019s dowry. \r\n<p>\r\nVenera, 34, is married. She has two children. Her husband works as a shepherd. Venera is a housewife. She manages to earn a little money selling milk. Their total monthly income is around $105. Venera wants to obtain a loan to buy another cow.\r\n<p>\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<p>\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kerezbu, a fifty\u2013seven year old widow, is the leader of this group. Several years ago, Kerezbu left for Russia as a migrant worker. Hard work and determination helped her save her earnings and upon returning home, she started her own business. She is a mother to and has raised four children.  Her eldest daughter is married and lives separately. Her elder son is still working in Russia. Her middle son does odd jobs at the local market and her little daughter, 26, helps her in the business. Some people believe that the active part of your life ends once your children become grown\u2013ups, and you can quietly meet an old age and have rest. That\u2019s not the case with Kerezbu. Moreover, having received Kerezbu\u2019s upbringing, her children know that there is no free cheese in this world. Kerezbu has preferred to be active and not depend on them. Instead, she is a great example of a strong independent woman. Kerezbu\u2019s business is trade in women\u2019s underwear, night gowns, pajamas and T\u2013shirts. From her earnings, she invested around $715 to purchase goods. Now her current monthly income is $120. Her Russian experience is helping her to survive and be competitive. Kerezbu needs a loan to purchase goods for fall and winter seasons and increase her range of goods. Her immediate plans are to save money to buy a car for her middle son and marry her little daughter. \r\n<p>\r\nKerezbu\u2019s partners: Aida, Asel and Uulkan. Aida, 36, has three children. She plans to start her own business of running a shop. She hopes to obtain a loan as she wants to purchase foodstuffs, drinks, cereals and sugar.\r\n<p>\r\nAsel, 26, has one child. Together with her husband, she sells socks at a local market. They need a loan to buy a milk cow for breeding and for milk. \r\n<p>\r\nUulkan, 22, is married. She sells various kinds of jackets. Her husband and his brother help her transport the goods. Uulkan has applied for this loan because she needs to purchase new goods and increase the assortment. \r\n<p>\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<p>\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Her group is based in the Samana peninsula in the east of the Dominican Republic, where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unavailable.

She will use this new loan to invest in more products such as plantains, name (a potato like root) and booklets to sell in her store. She plans to use the profits to purchase, clothes, school uniforms, notebooks and shoes for her children, a cow for her family and to continue to improve her home. Additionally, in the long term she would like to save money for a vehicle to move her products and to continue to increase her savings.

M. is from the village of Sepac. She is 20 years old. Merlyn is married and has one infant-aged child. To make a living, Merlyn owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating as a reloader. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from being a load retailer in the local community. Merlyn has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Merlyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merlyn is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP to invest in expanding the business as a load retailer. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Merlyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a very responsible woman with three children under her care, who are the most important part of her life. She takes care of the children by herself, as she is a single mother. She has worked as the proprietor of a general store for 15 years, a business she started from her home. Little by little Maritza has managed to increase her sales as her number of customers has increased. Despite the difficulties she has faced, such as the lack of support since she has not had the sufficient amount of capital to invest in all the products, Maritza wishes to keep up with her business.

Camba-og, Hinigaran Negros Occidental. Analyn is 34 years old.  She is married to Jose Hernal, who presently operates a Tangkop business, which is a kind of fishing using a fish trap in deeper water just off the shoreline. Food is placed inside the trap to attract the fish, crabs and shrimp. After an hour, whatever is in the center of the maze-like cage is harvested. The couple has 3 children who are 12 to 17 years old. \n\nBased on experience,  Analyn knew that she could not rely on her husband's income from the Tangkop or fish trap because it is seasonal and the catch can sometimes be erratic. During stormy weather, her husband could not go to his fish trap and collect the catch. This is the reason why Analyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 - to be able to borrow money to add to her capital and start a general store which could provide her family with a more steady daily income. \n\nBecause of Analyn's regular income from her business, she could send their children to school and also provide for the daily household expenses. She earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,000 from her general store. Having her own income has gone a long way in improving the quality of life of the M. family.\n\nAnalyn's credit history with Kiva's partner NWTF-Project Dungganon has been good. She always pays her dues on time and completely pays off her loan within the loan term. Her last loan, which was her 12th from NWTF-PD -- amounting to PHP 17,000 -- was invested in her general store. She industriously paid her weekly installments.  Now that she has paid it off, she is borrowing her next cycle loan of PHP 19,000 to fix her husband's fish trap so that he can continue with his fishing business. \n\nThey intend to use the profits from this loan to start a rice retailing business to further increase their income and save up for their children's college education. \n\nAnalyn is shown here in front of her General Store as it is quite difficult to photograph her in the middle of the sea where her husband's Tangkop or fish trap is located.\n \nAbout NWTF: \n\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":396031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"Maintenance of Tangkop (fish cage)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Hinigaran, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-10-03T09:17:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Analyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":760}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":3800,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4030.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004163,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3040,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3224.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848934,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3040,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3224.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739602,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3040,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3224.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129028,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3040,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3224.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965825,"comment":null},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3040,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3224.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997739,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-03T15:49:56Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":141376,"name":"Ana Judith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana Judith M.

He has engaged in this profession for more than 17 years, having started the business with help from his brother, who loaned him the money needed to start his own business. This is how Noel came to own his own business; he had to struggle since he has two children to care for. Noel has faced many challenges such as not having enough capital and not having people to support his progress; for this reason, financing has been of great help to his business.

Her husband, James P., is now 26 years old and is working as a farmer. It is difficult for them to manage financially because neither of them has a stable job, but with the help of their parents, they survive. <p>\r\nAt present, her husband is also sometimes hired as a house carpenter when not busy with farming; however, his income is not sufficient to finance all the needs of his family. In this regard, Janet decided to engage in a hog raising business to help her husband in generating income for their family needs. Janet wanted to borrow a loan from Kiva lenders amounting to PHP5,000 as additional working capital for hog raising. She hopes to have a productive business in order to provide her family with a secure and comfortable living someday. She hopes that lenders will lend her the funds she is requesting for the improvement of her newly opened piggery

They are currently living harmoniously with their two children at Barangay Tuao North Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. According to her, \u201cHard work and thriftiness are the keys to success\u201d. Having this principle in life gives Judy guidance to work harder and economize as much as she can, to give her family a better and more successful living. Despite the hardship and difficulties of life, they work hard to earn and support the education of their children, for they want them to be successful in their studies someday.<p>\r\n\r\nFarming is their main source of living. They cultivate their farm land twice a year by planting rice, corn and some vegetables and root crops. As harvesting takes a long time, they needed to have a side line business to provide for their daily needs and support the financial needs of their children in school. In this regard, Judy tried to engage in selling food snacks in their village through house to house vending. When she found out that this was so beneficial to her customers, she planned to continue and strengthen the business. Because of financial difficulty, she came to join the Kiva loan program of ASKI where she could have the chance to avail of additional working capital of at least PHP5,000. She hopes to have the opportunity to enhance her business for the improvement of their poor living situation.

End-of-term  loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Borrowers with EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term  loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

Sergelen operates a ger cover selling business at Narantuul, the largest market in UB. He purchases the covers from his family's company and sells them out of a small workspace at the market.. Sergelen started his ger cover business in 2002 and has been successful. Due to the high traffic of the market and his ability to cheaply purchase ger covers from his relative's business, his earnings have been high. For the future, he hopes to one day start his own factory where he can produce his own ger covers to sell.

In the rice growing, they face A. obstacle because they do not have enough money to buy rice seed and fertilizer to support the paddy field. Thus, Mrs. Horn B. decided to ask for a loA. for this purpose. She is 51 years old and the mother of six children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory while another stays at home to do housework and the others are enrolled in the local school. \n\nTwelve members in this group loans are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loA. until the very end of the loA. term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows thE. to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loA. term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

She is 41 years old, married, and has 2 children, ages 14 and 16.  She attended school through the seventh grade when she dropped out due to pregnancy.  At that time the government did not permit pregnant girls to continue attending school.  She lives with her husband and children in their own home.  They do not support anyone else. \r\n\r\nShe left the city of Maputo in 2000 to move to Boane to find better conditions and opportunities for business.  She has had her own business since 1980.  Besides her running her business (selling commodity goods) she also raises cattle and grows crops in the Umbeluzi river valley, in the Boane district. \r\n\r\nIn her business she sells rice, flour and drinks where she earns approximately 5.500,00 MT monthly.  She uses the money to support her family and she manages to save money in her Barclays bank account.  Her husband does not have formal employment and does odd jobs.\r\n\r\nThis is Atalia's first loan with Hluvuku-Adsema, in the amount of 10.000,00MT, to be used for the purchase and resale of commodity goods (rice, flour, etc.).  She has previously had loans with a similar organization that operated in the district on an ambulatory basis.  She decided not to continue with them for various reasons.\r\n\r\nShe plans to pay back the loan without incident in order to have access to future loans with the goal of growing her business, especially during the next holiday season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

Once they adapted to their new environment and assimilated into the local community, the couple started looking for better ways to support their family.\r\n\r\nOnce settled, she started making new friends in Escalante, and one of them invited her to do something that literally changed her life. When she said yes to her friend to attend an orientation at NWTF-Project Dungganon, Manuela opened a new door in her life. With 3 kids to raise and a family to support, she was receptive to new ideas, and when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997, she decided to invest her first loan into a fishing business, because she observed that it provided a decent living for most of her neighbors. Even with no previous experience, the couple was able to make a go of this new venture, and they were able to payback the first loan.\r\n\r\nStriving hard to move out of poverty, they kept focus on their goals, and as the loan amounts available to them increased because of their good business practices and prompt payments, they were eventually able to buy a motorized fishing boat which allowed them to go farther out to sea. They also bought additional fishing nets and crab traps, increasing their income potential.\r\n\r\nThe business earns a net income of PHP 4,000 per month which helps a lot in supporting their family. She just paid off her previous loan of PHP 7,000, her 8th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, which she used to buy fishing tools. Now she is borrowing PHP 9,000 for her 9th loan cycle to repair their fishing boat and nets so that she and her husband can continue earning a livelihood for their family of five.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

Jessie, who is 54 years old, is married to Renato  and lives in the village of Purok 2, Barangay Carabalan, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.  Their children, the oldest of whom is 27, and the youngest 12, live with them.\r\n\r\nShe already had a cafeteria beside her house years before she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon. It was not much but it helped defray their daily expenses and the education of their children. But it was only after she became a PD member in 2002 that her business expanded. Pouring in more capital to her cafeteria resulted in higher returns, and as she paid off the loans in each cycle, she was able to access even bigger loans because of her good track record of paying on time. Later she decided to turn over the management of the cafeteria to her husband and she set up a vegetable stand in the market to earn additional income. This new arrangement proved to be a wise decision for the couple as their family income grew. She has even started selling household commodities in addition to vegetables to provide her customers with variety. The vegetable stand nets an average monthly income of PHP 4,000 and pays for the education of her children and provides savings. From her earnings, she was able to buy a motorcycle to use in her business.\r\n\r\nOver the years, she's kept a her good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon. On her previous loan, her 21st loan cycle, she borrowed PHP 25,000 and put it all into her business and fully paid on time without any delays. And for her 22nd cycle she borrowed PHP 26,000 which she intends to use to purchase larger quantities of vegetables and spices to boost her earning capacity. She is planning to invest her income from this cycle to go into the pig-fattening business and also to add to the capital of the cafeteria.  The balance will be used for house repair.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

Malingin, Bago City, Negros Occidental. She is married to Eliseo T., who owns and operates a machine shop.  They have a 12-year-old child who is currently in school. \r\n<p>\r\nLina and her husband are entrepreneurs.  Even before she got married, Lina already had her own general store, while her husband already had his machine shop. When they got married, it looked as if they would have a stable life, with both of them already having their own livelihoods. But sharp economic downturns can befall anyone. At one point, Eliseo wanted to give up his machine shop because he thought that he could no longer afford to buy the necessary spare parts for his machines and he was worried about the competition. But Lina encouraged him to go on and not to lose hope.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause she was able to spare some of her capital from the general store to help her husband's business, they were able to survive that crisis. That event opened Eliseo's eyes to the fact that, in order to grow, they needed to have additional capital. When he heard about NWTF-Project Dungganon, he encouraged Lina to join, which she did in 2004. From then on she was able to borrow money to use as capital for both the general store and the machine shop, helping both businesses thrive.\r\n<p>\r\nOn her 4th loan cycle, Lina expanded her general store and also purchased additional materials for her husband's machine shop. Their combined monthly net income from their businesses provides them with 12,000 pesos per month, which they mostly plow back into the businesses after setting some money aside for household expenses and savings for the education of their only child.\r\n<p>\r\nFor her previous 14th loan cycle, Lina borrowed 19,000 pesos and this amount contributed to the continued success of the family businesses. She was able to pay everything back on time and in full. She plans to borrow 20,000 pesos for her 15th loan cycle, so that she can buy more items to sell in her general store. She plans to use the profits to rent a farm so that she can increase her income even further. She has high hopes for the future of her child.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

though she has only one daughter, Melanie H. still works hard to earn a living because she wants to provide her daughter with financial security. She is a 43-year-old woman, living in the village of Brgy. Canggapas Anahaw, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. Melanie is married to Jose H., a truck driver who delivers sugarcane from the farm to the sugar mill. Driving a truck, in an industry that is known for its seasonality, cannot provide even a small family with a stable source of income. Even less, when the actual amount he receives for his labor is examined.\n\nWith no guaranteed income from her husband for part of the year to rely on for their family's needs, Melanie decided to earn her own living to supplement whatever income her husband earns and to provide their family with a more stable financial resource. When she was ready to start her business, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access a collateral-free loan it offers, and used it to set up a general store. \n\nAs her earnings grew, and her customer base expanded, she saw another opportunity for expansion - offering electronic reloading to prepaid mobile phone subscribers, many of whom were already patronizing her general store. With the fast turnover of her business she was able to increase her income. She now earns a monthly average of 7,000 pesos from her general store. Her industriousness has paid off:  she is happy to report that her daughter has graduated from college.\n\nIn her previous 16th loan cycle, she was able to borrow 19,000 pesos which was used as additional capital for her business. She paid back all of the weekly installments on time, keeping her good credit rating with NWT-Project Dungganon. She is planning to borrow 19,000 pesos for her 17th loan cycle to support her general store and electronic reloading business.\n\nAbout NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon!\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":395747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

C.'s an entrepreneur who values her time - she says that time is gold so she does not waste any of it, if she can do something to earn money to achieve her dream faster. She is a 50-year-old widow who lives in the town of Valladolid, Negros Occidental. She has one big long-term dream and several smaller ones. Her biggest dream is to be able to renovate her house, improve her living standards and help her granddaughter afford higher education. \r\n<p>\r\nHer smaller, and maybe more immediate dream, is to be able to buy a tricycle (a motorcycle with a side car for passengers or goods) so that she can easily travel from town to town in pursuit of her business. Edna, or \"Nanay Edna\" (Mother Edna) as most people call her, has an ambulatory business selling fruits in different towns during their market day. She is so focused on her goals that she does not mind the rain or the heat of the sun if her efforts bring her one step nearer to the achievement of her dreams.\r\n<p>\r\nNanay Edna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 to increase the volume of fruits she offers for sale \u2013 in effect also increasing her income potential. She now earns an average monthly income of 10,000 pesos for her tireless efforts. She is very prompt in her payments, and follows all the rules, depositing her payment in the bank a day before the scheduled weekly NWTF-PD Center meeting. She pays directly to the bank to avoid any untoward incidents.\r\n<p>\r\nFor her previous loan, she got 19,500 pesos which was quite a lot of capital for her, but she was able to fully pay her loan on time and within the term set. This time around, for her ninth loan cycle, she has requested the same amount, 19,500 pesos, to be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital for her business. Income from the business will be used for house improvements.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable.

capacidad para 15 pasajeros) la cual inscribi\u00f3 en una compa\u00f1\u00eda de transporte p\u00fablico que cubre la ruta Pimentel \u2013 Chiclayo, esta es la \u00fanica fuente de ingreso con la cual se solventan los gastos econ\u00f3micos diarios y tambi\u00e9n los gastos de educaci\u00f3n y cuidado de sus hermanos menores.\n\nEl continuo uso de esta unidad m\u00f3vil ha hecho que empiece a sufrir considerables da\u00f1os en el motor, dej\u00e1ndola fuera de operatividad, lo que le ha llevado a solicitar por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 2500 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la reparaci\u00f3n y en el mantenimiento general de su fuente de ingreso.\n\nCarla sue\u00f1a con tener una flota de veh\u00edculos dedicados al servicio de transporte p\u00fablico y

located on the highway to Pimental, 15 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nWith her family's savings and great sacrifices, they were able to purchase a combi (a 15-passenger van) which was then registered with a public transportation company that covers the route between Pimental and Chiclayo. This is the only source of income with which they cover daily expenses as well as education and childcare expenses for her younger siblings. \r\n\r\nThe continuous use of this vehicle has begun to cause considerable damage to its engine, leaving it inoperable. This is what has led her to request her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 2500 nuevos soles, which she plans to invest in the repair and general maintenance of her source of income. \r\n\r\nCarla dreams of owning a fleet of vehicles dedicated to public transportation as well as pursuing a technical degree in administration in order to continue supporting her family.\r\n\r\nShe is

Her husband works from time to time as a fisherman, and since it is difficult to support a family with this activity, Luisa decided five years ago to support the family finances with a business selling fresh fish.  She started to sell fish in the streets, and little by little her business grew. Now she sells in the towns of the region that don't have access to the sea and sporadically she also sells in the city of Tumbes, which is six hours from the city of Chiclayo.  Generally when she travels to Tumbes she distributes some advance orders, but the majority of times she sells in the area market.  She goes to purchase merchandise in the district fisheries terminal two or three times per week; she also sells salted dried fish that are processed there.  Currently her children are about to finish school.  Luisa would like to provide them with the opportunity to study in a university, but the income that her business generates is not sufficient to achieve this desire.  For this reason she is planning on expanding her business with the purchase of more fish to process and sell, financed by a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 2000 nuevos soles.  She wishes to continue working with her husband so that they can buy an automobile and to use it to transport passengers in a transportation business that covers the Chiclayo-Santa Rosa route.  Luisa has worked with Edpyme Alternativa on other opportunities and in all of them she has demonstrated responsibility and punctuality in her payments, and for this reason she is considered to be an excellent client.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

For the last 8 months she has had a small restaurant in her brother's house, which she runs with her sister-in-law.  The idea for the restaurant originated with her sister-in-law, who had already had a restaurant in Jaen before moving to Reque.  The women started to work by selling beer and, later, using their own resources, they have been able to enlarge the business.\r\n<p>\r\nThe establishment has many customers due to the quality of service and the good flavor of the dishes that Clotilde prepares.  Her potential customers are the farm workers who work nearby, and even people from the city, including some tourists.\r\n<p>\r\nWith earnings from this business, Clotilde helps her parents by sending them money, since they are of advanced age and can no longer work.  Everyday she gives her best to advance her business.  One fruit of this business is that they have begun constructing a small room on the second floor for attending to customers.\r\n<p>\r\nClotilde is requesting a loan for the first time with Edpyme Alternative for $700, to be used in buying construction materials to finish the room already under construction.\r\n<p>\r\nShe dreams of making her establishment grow and having her own home.  Clotilde is hardworking and enterprising, and her customers and neighbors consider her a responsible and amiable person.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

Her husband used to work as a civil construction worker, but due to his age he had to quit his job and take up his previous profession as a baker. \r\n\r\nGregoria works with her husband from 6 in the evening until very late in the night, mixing the ingredients to make bread and then baking early in the morning before taking it out to sell. Every day her two youngest children leave the house by bicycle at 5.30 in the morning to distribute bread to the customers and then go on to school once they have finished.\r\n\r\nThe continual increase in the price of the supplies that Gregoria regularly uses to make bread (flour, butter and wood for the oven) has meant that the business' daily income is not enough to cover all the family's costs. For this reason, she has seen the need to apply to Edpyme Alternativa for the first time for a loan of 1100 nuevos soles, which she intends to invest in the purchase of more supplies to expand her business.  \r\n\r\nGregoria dreams of being able to finish building her house and for her two youngest children to study a technical degree. She is a hardworking, honest woman who is very loved by her neighbours.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzanne Grasso, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":398426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of supplies to make bread","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chosica del Norte - La Victoria - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-10-02T01:50:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1100,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":134.31},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.03},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":147.18},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.18},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":176.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.96},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.13},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":48.84,"local_amount":134.31,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":141.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780653,"comment":null},{"amount":53.47,"local_amount":147.03,"processed_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":154.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669552,"comment":null},{"amount":53.52,"local_amount":147.18,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":154.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065059,"comment":null},{"amount":57.96,"local_amount":159.39,"processed_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":167.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900169,"comment":null},{"amount":60.13,"local_amount":165.38,"processed_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":173.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934305,"comment":null},{"amount":126.08,"local_amount":346.71,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":364.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661942,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-02T04:45:30Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":141537,"name":"Maria Asunta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Maria Asunta, es natural de distrito de Anta, e la provincia de Anta y departamento del Cusco, ubicado a 1 hora y 10 minutos de la provincia de Cusco.\n\nNuestra socia tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad, ella vive en la comunidad campesina de Inquilpata, la socia es madre soltera, tiene 2 hijos menores y ella es madre y padre para sus menores hijos, ella alterna sus actividades del hogar con la crianza de animales menores, nuestra socia, compra animales al por mayor y menor, los hace reproducir y a sus ves los vende, entre los animales que ella cr\u00eda est\u00e1n, los cuyes, aves de corral, chanchos, la socia requiere el pr\u00e9stamo para aumentar su producci\u00f3n en la adquisici\u00f3n de m\u00e1s animales menores.\n\nNuestra socia agradece y valora el pr\u00e9stamo otorgado y as\u00ed mismo se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas en el plazo establecido.\n","en":"The member, Maria Asunta is from the district of Anta, province of Anta, department of Cusco, located an hour and ten minutes from the province of Cusco.\r\n\r\n<p>Our member is 30 years old and lives in the country community of Inquilpata.

Mar\u00eda has had a small restaurant\/bar for the past three years, which operates next to her home. At present, this business is the family's only source of income since Mar\u00eda's husband works on and off as an agricultural laborer. This business has been growing steadily, and the few tables and chairs in it are not enough to accommodate the many clients that come to enjoy the great service it provides. Therefore, for the first time, Mar\u00eda finds herself asking Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa, a PEN 2,500 loan that she plans to invest in the purchase of furniture to increase the service capacity of her establishment. Mar\u00eda dreams of making her business infrastructure better to offer good service and to start serving tourists who come to the area to visit the natural reserve of the P\u00f3mac forests. In the future, she would also like to provide her kids with the opportunity to study a technical career with which they can earn a living.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":398661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase crops in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-10-02T06:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felista ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87832,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868345,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":87831.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757541,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":87832,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146635,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":87832,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984780,"comment":null},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":87831.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015453,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87832.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740459,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-04T14:44:46Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":141581,"name":"Karine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Karine B. lives in the village of Gandzaqar near the town of Ijevan.

from Tanzania! This is 25-year-old Lidia S. from Tukuyu. She is married with 2 children, aged 2 and 4. Lidia has been running a business selling used clothes since 2007. The business involves importing second-hand clothes across the oceans from America and Europe, which are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers. The retailers then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost and the general appeal of anything modern. She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Lidia currently earns about $80 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more clothes in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Lidia thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":398684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

She is a widow and has two daughters. One of the daughters is married and lives separately, and the other one lives with Leyli. Since 2003, Leyli has operated a food store in a place her brothers owns in the central street of Ijevan. Previously, she had worked in the Ijevan food-processing factory, until it was closed, along with most of Armenian factories. With the profits from her business, Leyli provided for some of her family\u2019s needs, such as buying necessary furniture and home appliances and organizing her elder daughter\u2019s wedding. Leyli likes her work and, most of all, appreciates that she can help pensioners by taking them home and helping to carry their purchases. Leyli is a fifth cycle borrower in Nor Horizon, and now she needs 600,000 AMD to buy sugar, sunflower-seed oil and tomato sauce for her shop. In the future she hopes to increase her income in order to collect enough money to repair her

She has four children, aged 15, 20, 22, and 24. She sells fruit in La Pampa, which is the fruit section of La Cancha.  La Cancha is an open-air market in the city of Cochabamba, and it also happens to be the largest open-air market in all of South America.  <P>\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda sells watermelons, Peruvian coconuts, pineapples, and papayas.  She also sells sugar cane and cane juice, which sell very well because she is one of the only vendors that offers them in La Pampa.  She typically sells the most on Saturdays and Sundays, and sometimes she travels to different markets to offer her goods.  <P>\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been selling fruit in La Pampa for five years.

All of his products are made with great care and attention to detail which has earned him a reputation among his customers as a quality furniture provider. <P>\r\n\r\nHe would like to increase his sales so that he can afford to build a house by the end of next year.

Tarqu\u00ed is characterized by its plains, and it is the sector that produces the most milk and dairy livestock.  Its climate is cold.  Most of the people work in agriculture and livestock.  A large part of the population of youths has immigrated to different parts of the world to give their families economic stability.  The members, with their characteristic charisma, tell us their stories.\r\n\r\nDelia Eudocial V. V. lives in the Chilcato Tora community in the Tarqu\u00ed parish.  She is a member of the communal bank with the same name as her community.  She is 55, married, and has seven children.  She does not remember their ages because they are all adults and married.  She only remembers that her last daughter is 27, and she is the only one that is single.  Three of her married children live in her house and help economically once in a while.  They have their own responsibilities in the home.  Her husband is a farmer, and through his work in his youth they were able to build a house.\r\n\r\nDelia has been a farmer ever since she was young.  She plants cabbage, lettuce, and turnips, etc.  She raises hens and sells their eggs.  She has two calves, and she is raising them to later sell.  She also has a small store, but she is lacking a lot of supplies.\r\n\r\nWithin the communal bank the members are very good friends.  They are from the same community, and they have known each other for several years.  This is her first loan with the foundation.  She will buy products like rice, sugar, oil, and noodles, etc. to better stock her store.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have no more debts.  She is now helping her son who traveled abroad to pay the expenses he incurred on his trip.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Tr\u00e1nsito P. C. is another member of the Mujeres de Chilcato Tora Communal Bank.  She lives in the community that has the same name as her bank in the Tarqu\u00ed parish.  She is 65, married, and has five children.  She does not remember the ages of her children.  She only remembers the age of her last child who is 25, single, and still lives with her.  Her husband does not work because he became allergic to the cement dust.  This stopped him from doing his work.  She and her husband built a small adobe house.  Their economic situation is down, and all of the community knows it.  Also, she was diagnosed with diabetes five years ago.  Now she has to take very good care of herself to not have a relapse in her health.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been raising chickens for a short time.  She also has a cow, and she sells her milk to the milk carts in the area.  But, they pay very little.  This is her first loan with the foundation.  All of her friends supported her joining, and she tries to get ahead with the benefits the foundation offers their members.  With this loan from ESPOIR she will buy more chickens, food, and vitamins for their growth.  This way she will expand her business and have a secure income to pay the medication and household expenses.  Her dream is to see all of her children succeed personally and economically.  \r\n\r\nTeresa Elvira C. C. lives in the Chilcato Tora community in the Tarqu\u00ed parish.

Her first daughter is studying dressmaking at an open academy.  Her second daughter is married and lives independently.  Her 20 year old son works in construction, but all of the money is only for his expenses.  Her last three children are still in school.  Her husband migrated to the exterior to give them a better future.  Thanks to that, they have been able to build their own house.\r\n\r\nTerese is a farmer; most of her crops are for household consumption.  She also raises animals like dairy cows, pigs, and chickens, etc.  She sells them in the community.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with the foundation.

For eight years she has had a small grocery store in her house in which she offers her clients essential products (rice, oil, sugar), vegetables, and drinks (soft drinks and beer).  This business is the only stable source of economic income that her family possesses, since her husband works occasionally as a miner in the southern part of the country.\r\n\r\nA few months ago, thanks to the shared effort of her husband and the support of Edpyme Alternativa, she was able to finish building her house.  However, the construction forced her to stop attending to her business, and consequently her business now finds itself unstocked.  For this reason she is requesting a credit of 1,000 nuevos soles from Edpyme Alternativa, with which she plans to restock her business.\r\n\r\nThe product of which she sells the most are drinks.  However, thinking of the future of her children who are still studying, she plans to expand her business with the sale and promotion of groceries.

P. is a 31-year-old woman living in the village of Punta Tagda, Brgy. Tagda, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She is married to Edgardo P., who drives a motorcycle to shuttle passengers around their community and also manages the operations of the two motorized fishing boats they own. Aside from being a business women, she also works as a clerk in their barangay (Village Council), and the salary she earns supplements their family income.The couple has two children who are only 4 and 5 years old. They are the reason Analyn strives so hard in her business ventures \u2013 so that she can provide her children with financial security and be able to send them to good schools.\r\n<p>\r\nThe couple\u2019s eagerness to attain their dream is the driving force behind all their endeavors. It was actually Edgardo who encouraged Analyn to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 so that she could start her own business. Her first venture, after she joined NWTF-PD, was selling fish in her community and the nearby barangays. She immediately saw that it could provide her family with a good income because, even with the small capital she started with, she was able to help her husband pay for some of the household expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nAnalyn continued with her business activities and expanded by selling capiz shells to a handicraft maker. With a more steady income, she was able to pay her loan installments on time and establish a good credit performance with her group, center and NWTF-PD. Accordingly, she has been able to increase her loan amount at each new loan cycle, enabling her to afford a motorized fishing boat. From the profits of her fishing venture, she bought a motorcycle with a sidecar for her husband to enable him to add to their daily income. Her husband operates it when there's bad weather conditions or when there's trouble with the fishing boat. As their business activities improved, she was able to buy a second motorized fishing boat and hire a helper to operate it. Analyn continues to sell the fish catch in the public market and around their community.  This earns her a minimum of 7,000 pesos per month. She has been able to save for her children\u2019s future, pay her debts on time and cover household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nFor her 11th  loan cycle, she borrowed 29,000 pesos to add to her working capital. When she paid that off, within the loan term and without any delays, she applied for a 12th loan of 29,000 pesos so that she could have revolving working capital for her business ventures: fishing, fish vending and selling capiz shell. She intends to save some of her income for her children.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable.

and dedication are the keys to success according to Florentina S., 48 years old, who has continuously improved her living through her own efforts. \r\n<p>\r\nShe is married to Jose Jerry S. who is presently engaged in fish vending together with his wife. They have 3 children, the oldest of whom is 21 and the youngest of whom is just 9 years old. The family lives in the village of Prk. Balinghoy, Brgy. Malingin Bago City Negros Occidental.  \r\n<p>\r\nFlorentina grew up in a very poor family. Her parents could not afford to send their children to school, but she strived hard to support herself and get a proper education by selling fish with her parents to different barangays (villages). \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she got married, she, together with her husband, continued selling fish in her community, neighboring barangays and nearby towns. Because they sold good quality fish, they soon had regular customers in every place they went, selling all their stocks much faster. \r\n<p>\r\nBut even with the ongoing business, they were starting to worry that they might not be able to save enough to send their children to college later on. This propelled Florentina to join NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could expand her business and be able to buy more fish to sell. Now she earns an average profit of PHP 10,000 per month, good enough to support their family with enough left over to save for her children's higher education.\r\n<p>\r\nFor her previous 9th cycle loan she borrowed Php 15,000 for her business. She was able to repay her loan on time without any delays. She planned to borrow for her 10th cycle loan the same amount of Php 15,000 that she intends to use in her fish vending business. She plans to expand her business. If there is any extra income, she plans to put up a general store and the rest will be saved for children future.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout Kiva's partner NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":397216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Additional capital for fish vending","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bago, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-10-03T01:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2440.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004171,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2440.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848942,"comment":null},{"amount":65,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3050.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739610,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2440.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129032,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2440.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965831,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2440.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997745,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-10-03T08:56:53Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":141704,"name":"Mamerta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mamerta D. is from the village of Centro Napu,Tudela,Misamis Occidental.

L., who lives in Hacienda Sarait, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental, is married to Rey Largavita. She's a hardworking mother who wants to provide financial security for her two sons who, although already 25 and 26, have special needs because of their inborn disabilities. She is now 57 years old and worries how her sons will fend for themselves when she and her husband pass on. This is why Epifania and Rey are working very hard now to set aside some money to provide for their sons' future financial security. \r\n\r\nAs ambulant food vendors, they do a lot of walking. On a regular working day, Epifania and Rey wake up at dawn to go to the public market to buy the ingredients for their menu of the day. Epifania prepares and cooks all of the food they plan to sell, then Rey helps her pack the food into single-serve packets and arrange them equally in separate baskets. Once their food baskets are packed, Epifania takes her sons to her a neighbor she trusts to take care of them while they are working. That done, Epifania and Rey take their respective baskets and go on separate selling routes around the town, visiting their regular customers first. By walking, they increase their probability for a sale because people they meet on the street usually stop to buy the packed food they offer. When all the food is sold, they go home to rest and get things ready to do the same routine again the following day.\r\n\r\nIn July 2001, Epifania joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to borrow additional capital for her food vending business. With the additional capital, she was able to increase the food volume and also expand the variety of food that she and her husband sell. Her cooking has become so popular with other members of NWTF-PD that she now brings food to sell during the weekly center meetings that she attends. With the loans that provide her with much-needed working capital, her business has improved a lot. She earns a net profit of 8,000 Philippine pesos per month on the average, and it has been a great help for her family, especially in allowing her to afford the maintenance medicines that her sons need, as well as pay for all their household expenses.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 19,000 on her 15th loan cycle was fully paid within term and without any delays in the weekly installments. Now she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to buy a gas stove to cook food much faster, and the balance will again be used as revolving working capital to buy the daily ingredients of her products.\r\n\r\nEpifania is shown in the attached picture with her food offerings during one of the center meetings in the NWTF-PD Center house.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":397264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
