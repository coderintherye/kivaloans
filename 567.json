She carries out her responsibilities as a housewife, and besides her household work, she also supports her family financially by selling clothes to customers in her neighborhood. She visits Multan, a historic city famous for its embroidery art, once a month to buy clothes for resale.\r\n\r\nMunnawar has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to buy clothes in bulk to offer more variety to her clients and, hopefully, to earn more profits.  Buying in bulk will reduce the time and cost of travel to Multan, as she won't need to make as many buying trips.  She has had her business for five years and is hopeful that further investment will put her business in a more profitable position.\r\n\r\nNote: In the photo that accompanies this profile, Munnawar is

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Indelicia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,300, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 to buy salt, milk, and peanuts so that she can continue to save up for the future renovation of her house and the education of her children.

is a married woman who lives in the island of Cebu. She earns her living by raising pigs and operating a general store. Her husband Ramon, who is 53 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are between 15 and 30 years old. Lourdes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lourdes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy more piglets and feed so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Lourdes is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

C. is 67 years old, married and has seven adult-aged children. She is from the village of Danao within Plaridel municipality, a part of Misamis Occidental province on the Mindanao islands. Warlita runs a general store from which she sells a variety of different products to the local community. She has been in business for over eleven years and earns approximately 18,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 1999, Warlita joined PMPC to gain access to its financial services. She successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC which was used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. Warlita is requesting a new loan, her nineteenth loan from PMPC, of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase retail products for her general store. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that one-on-one translations of entrepreneur profiles are costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow it to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":725063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 43 years old. Emelita is the group leader of a 8-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nEmelita is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Emelita owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes  from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Emelita has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Emelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Emelita is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Emelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":735252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Kyrgyz people are proud of their horsemanship. It is often said that Kyrgyz boys learn to ride before they can walk. Cattle and other animals have played a tremendous role in Kyrgyz culture and history since nomadic times.\r\n  \r\nAnarkul A., 54, is the leader of this group. A proud mother of five children, she values animals like her own family. Her mother taught her to have a tender attitude towards animals so that they, in turn, can feel and reward you with help in hard times. \r\n\r\n<p>Anarkul's husband coaches in a local sports school and devotes his entire free time to helping Anarkul feed the cattle and take them to a cattle yard. Their children are no longer financially dependent on Anarkul and her husband. The reselling of cattle allows the couple to cover their daily expenses and improve home comforts. The idea originated two years ago, thanks to the advice of close friends, well-trained cattle breeders. The couple borrowed some funds to start up the business. They later earned enough to repay their debts in time. Now that the business allows her to cover her costs, Anarkul gathered together this group, which she believes deserves financial assistance from Kiva lenders. Anarkul is a very responsible and self-organized leader who promises to repay the loan on time. Her personal purpose for the loan is to purchase extra heads of cattle for further resale. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

In the future, she would like to use the returns from the business to finish construction of a temporary structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

They saved sizable funds and bought their first dairy cow. This purchase was very overwhelming and meaningful for Bermet\u2019s belief and motivation. Now the business has several heads of cattle and generates a profit of 2,000 KGS monthly and up to 3-4 liters of milk daily, which is further sold for 11 KGS per liter. It\u2019s been ten years since the start of the business, and the couple helped organize a nice wedding ceremony for their daughter. Bermet's short term goals include purchasing 2 sheep in order to diversify the household. Bermet believes in Kiva lenders\u2019 assistance to reach this goal.

Lidia's business is making skirts and traditional clothing and she has been in this business for 3 years.  She learned the trade from her friends and formed a partnership with her sister-in-law in order to buy sewing machines and embroidery machines which help her to optimize her work, producing better-quality garments more quickly.  This means that she saves time that she can then spend looking after her young daughter.  Lidia's usual work hours are 'nearly all day' but they also depend on the quantity of clothes that she has to make and on orders that her customers make for festive events in their area.  When this is the case, she takes her products to people who sell traditional clothing in the markets.\r\n\r\nLidia enjoys her work and would like to carry out plans to grow her business.  This is her second loan with MFP.

Oro\" [Little Gold Bell]. The group is located in the community of El Rincon D. los Pirules, San Felipe del Progreso. The community is low income, and a little far from town. Because of this, there are few public services, the roads have gravel on them or have a lot of loose earth. In general, the commuity works in farming and cattle. There is no traffic light in the community and transportation is very limited. It does have a high school so that the youth can be educated and not have to spend money travelling to the downtown. The group is maD. up of 8 people. They are 8 women who have their activities, but who need some help to improve a little. They decided to call themselves \"Campanita D. Oro\" because they think that it brings good luck to their businesses and is good for the group in general. The names of the group members are the following: \r\n\r\n1.-Florenacia D. L. C. G.,  48 years old.  \r\n2.-Claudia E. G., 23 years old.\r\n3.-Ma Benita Catarina B., 45 years old.\r\n4.-Delfina M. F., 32 years old. \r\n5.-Gregoria S. C., 56 years old. \r\n6.-Heriberta M. E., 32 years old.\r\n7.-Lucia S. A., 25 years old. \r\n8.-Juana A. T., 58 years old. \r\n\r\nThe group representative is named Heriberta. She is a neighbor of all of the members and she has known them for several years, and she gets along well with them. She has 4 children and they all go to school. She has been married for 10 years. She lives in her own house with her husband, who works as a bricklayer and carpenter. Heriberta has a small locale in her house where she sells beverages, water and chips. She needs more things so that things can improve for her a little. She needs an investment to buy other things as well that her store needs, such as: eggs and ham, which sell well, because they are far from town and a lot of people need them. Also, sausages and chorizo as well as dairy products. In short, she needs a lot of things that she wants to sell but she lacks the money to sell all of it. One of her goals is for the business to grow and little by little to have a large store in the community, in order to improve the quality of life in her family.

The three members of the group are as follows:  \r\n\r\nDeonila Guti\u00e9rrez M.: will invest her funds into the purchase of ingredients for making tamales, to later sell within her own community.\r\n\r\nCarmela Hern\u00e1ndez S\u00e1nchez: will invest her funds into materials for making doors, windows, and other items, to later sell.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda del Carmen N.

He is married to Jenny, 25, and they have two daughters, Sharleni, 6, and Yasmin, 4. They live in their own home, located in the Nueva Esperanza community, a village in the district of Quimbiri. \r\n\r\nFrom his childhood his parents taught him to work on the farm, so he knows the hard field work very well. Yoni is a farmer and owns 5 hectares of land with coffee and cocoa plants. He has worked in his land for 7 years. During harvest time he has the support of labourers who harvest the fruits and transport them. What he enjoys the most about his work is harvesting, as he feels that the quality of his produce is the reward for months of hard work. What he considers most  difficult  is transporting the produce on animals from the farm to the collection centres. He uses donkeys in the 3 hour walk to the collection centres.  \r\n\r\nHe says that he doesn't like winter, which brings insects and rain that hinder his work and damage his crops. The requested loan is to buy fertilisers to improve his produce. In future he would also like to expand his cocoa crops using machinery. This is his fifth loan with MFP and he is willing to fulfill the payment schedule, as the loans granted by the organisation will benefit him highly. With the 2.000 soles requested he will buy fertilizer and manure to improve the productivity of his cocoa  and coffee plants.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":736629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

By working in her new business, with savings and loans, she can make her dreams come true. \r\n\r\nHer story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) generally. Her group is located in Santiago, an area famous for tobacco and beef production, the second biggest city in the Dominican Republic. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.

It takes her several days to make each of these products.  She tells us that lately her business has been doing very well.  In order to sell her products, Ver\u00f3nica must travel to Pinotepa Nacional where she sells them in the market.  This is one hour away from her town.\r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica has been engaged in this business activity for 8 years.  She inherited it from her mom since it is a technique that is passed down from generation to generation.  Ver\u00f3nica dreams that her children will become professionals so that they will have better opportunities in life.  She would also like to see her products sell internationally since they are beautiful handicrafts that are made with a lot of effort and dedication.  Ver\u00f3nica uses the profits that she makes on her products to provide her family with money since her husband's income does not stretch far enough.  As he works in agriculture, they don't make much money and sometimes there is only enough money for food.  Ver\u00f3nica decided to make her products and sell them in order to help out.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are grateful to everybody who supports Fundaci\u00f3n so that they too can help lend to humble people who need it.

The group is comprised of 13 hardworking women.  All 13 are married.  They have their families and are housewives, but they are also involved in raising animals such as pigs, sheep, chickens, and turkeys.   They do this to obtain income and to help when they can with expenses, whether for their children in school or the needs of the household.  Also, because they don\u2019t have full time jobs they want to invest part of their time in something that is productive and that supports their husbands so that together they can progress, getting all the necessities of life that they currently need.\r\n<p>\r\nThe community of San Pedro is one of the most advanced communities in the municipality.  It has all the public services, like water and drains, a hospital, schools, and a service station.  In short, it is very complete and is also a community that has a lot of professionals and young students.  The group decided on the name Altamirano because it is a name which can bring a lot of luck to all its members since it is the name of a part of Chiapas and also of an important writer.  The thirteen members are:\r\n<p>\r\n1.-Concepci\u00f3n M. Mej\u00eda, age 30\r\n2.-Carolina S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez, age 29\r\n3.-Valentina B. Q., age 404.-Maria Jacinta D.

Q., age 31\r\n13.-Ana Rosa Severa S., age 24\r\n<p>\r\nCarolina is a representative of this group.  She has 3 children who study in primary school.  She lives in a common law relationship with her husband.  They have just built their own house, and she can help out by selling her animals.  What her husband earns will pay for the house.  Though they lack several things having the house is a big step.  Her husband drives a taxi, leaving very early and returning late.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Carolina raises lambs.  She tells us that her business is doing well because it brings in income, and it is not difficult to care for the animals.  The loan will bring great benefit because she is going to purchase lambs since, at the moment, she doesn\u2019t have any.  She sold what she had and the family needs income after building the house.  Her goals are to be able to finish their house so that it lacks nothing and to improve her family\u2019s quality of lif"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4775,"image":{"id":724803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy lambs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-03-23T20:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Concepci\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Jacinta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":57000,"loan_amount":4775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3562.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.44},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.44},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.43},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.44},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.44},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.44},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.43},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.44},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.44},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.44},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.43},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.43},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":895.31,"local_amount":10687.5,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":10729.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292495,"comment":null},{"amount":1193.75,"local_amount":14250,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":14305.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160753,"comment":null},{"amount":1193.75,"local_amount":14250,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":14305.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233627,"comment":null},{"amount":1492.19,"local_amount":17812.5,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:14Z","rounded_local_amount":17881.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512446,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-24T05:43:41Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":284325,"name":"San Bartolo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Rosario T.

This group is represented by Cerrano Cruz, she has three children and works as an aesthetician.

Alejandrina prepares homemade tortillas, tamales, sweet corn, squash, watermelon, and jicama. She sells about a third of what she prepares, and keeps the rest for her family's consumption. Alejandrina uses the maize and dried maize leaves (totomoztle) to make tamales. She sells all her products from a cart in front of her home and advertises her products through a car-mounted loudspeaker.   \r\n\r\nThis work has helped her family a lot, as she is able to feed and provide education for her children. Alejandrina says that despite farming many crops, she doesn't earn much from the harvest due to crop pests or too much rain. The family also consumes much of what is produced on the farm. Currently, Alejandrina's sales are good and she needs to buy some ingredients to continue making her food products. This is why she is requesting a loan to buy ingredients for making tortillas and tamales, such as whitewash (to coat the inside of the wood-burning oven), a tortilla pan, firewood, lard, chilies, onions, pork and chicken.\r\n\r\nThe following individuals are group members:\r\nCristina X Ram\u00edrez: Age 49, needs to purchase thread to embroider napkins that she sells.\r\nClaudina M.

He is a cheerful and hardworking man who lives with Marisol Navarro, 25, and their 3 children.  They all live together in a rented home in the jurisdiction of Santa Rosa, but they also own a home in the community of Anteccasa, an annex of the Santa Rosa district.  Marcelino started his business as a farmer when he was very young, working his parent's land.  His passion for agriculture led him to acquire his own land that he has been working independently for 17 years, cultivating coffee and coca leaves.  In all, he has 5 and a half hectares of land.  At harvest time he hires workers who help him to harvest the products more quickly, so that he can achieve faster progress with his work.  He is very dedicated to his job, because thanks to his daily efforts he is able to see his plants bear fruit and obtain good profits from every kilogram of product that he sells.  He asserts that he does not like the winter because during these months the insects are abundant and this negatively affects his crop yields.  The loan that he is applying for will be used to buy a cargo motorcycle to quickly deliver his products to the collection centers. But now, his priority is to replant his cultivations that were damaged with the intermittent rains.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he is ready to make all of his payments on time, since he wants to be able to access credit in the future.  He also feels very pleased that the institution is providing him with this loan.  With the 3,000 Peruvian soles requested, he will buy a cargo motorcycle that will he will use to transport his products from the farm to the collection centers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":736725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to buy a cargo motorcycle to transport his products.

The group has 10 hardworking members who struggle each day to have a better life.  \r\n\r\nCarmelita P\u00e9rez Nicol\u00e1s, 36, is the representative of the group.  She is a single mother who is admirable because she has worked hard and fought to provide for her 3 children.  Her oldest daughter is studying at the university and the two younger children are in elementary school.  Carmelita has a store where she sells groceries and perfumes which is called \"URI-MAURI\" because her two small children are named Uriel and Mauricio.  She has had this store for 19 years, ever since the birth of her oldest daughter.  She started the business because she needed to support her small daughter.  She is requesting a loan to buy products such as: rice, sugar, coffee, soap and other items because recently her sales have been very low and she does not have enough money to stock her store.  She uses the earnings from the store to support her children.  \r\n\r\nAnother member of the group is Martha Norma V\u00e1zquez S., 35, who is married to  Antelmo Quiroz Quiroz, a farmer. They have 4 children: 2 girls and 2 boys aged 20, 17, 12 and 11.  Martha has a business making bread, which she sells door-to-door.  She has had good sales and good earnings, since she has the only business in the neighborhood that sells bread.  In addition, her bread is very delicious and she offers variety in her products.  She started this business because her husband's income was not sufficient to cover the family's expenses, and because they needed more money to pay for their children's education.  She comments that at the start she only made 50 loaves of bread, but over time she has been increasing her sales.  For this reason she is requesting a loan so that she can buy more supplies and make more bread.  Martha says that her goal is to eventually have a bakery in her town, so that she could provide employment for some people in her community.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are the following:\r\nClaudina C. R., 27, who sells plastic products.\r\nAmada Yudiht Hern\u00e1ndez D\u00edaz, 40, who sells sweets. \r\nMartha Norma V\u00e1zquez S., 35, who makes bread to sell. \r\nJuanita Nicol\u00e1s S., 33, who has a grocery store.\r\nCita T.

From her home in the neighborhood of El Valle she works at her business selling soft drinks wholesale and selling beauty products through four catalogs with which Belkis is officially certified. These businesses started very small, she first started selling beer and soft drinks directly since she had a refrigerator. She now handles sales in wholesale volumes  to stores and establishments who increase their orders every day. Since Belkis is a very restless woman she not only has this business but also sells beauty products - a business she started before she was certified to sell products by catalog. A friend of hers provided her the access to the merchandise so that Belkis could sell it and she was able to get many clients which is why she decided to link herself to a catalog and to obtain her own certification. She currently handles four catalogs. Her dream is to have a shop in a location separate from her home and with its profits to pay for university studies for her children, something that is slowly coming up. This is the first loan she has obtained from field partner Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo which she will use to buy soft drinks at wholesale and she will also take advantage of sales so that she can better bargain with her clients and increase her profits.

His family could not help him financially so he got only as far as 6th grade.  He works very hard so this won't happen to his own children.

Although they make all kinds of clothes, their speciality is women's clothes because that is their biggest market.  Carlos Arturo and his wife share the work between them.  While he is in charge of buying raw materials and supplies, setting sales prices and negotiating their products in the market, his wife works exclusively on the production side of things.\r\n\r\nCarlos' wife learned her art by family tradition and the couple have become identified with it.  They used the profits that they made in their business to ensure that their children, who are now between the ages of 35 and 40, became professionals.  Their future goal is to hire a worker to increase their production, sales and profits as competition is strong, especially as regards imported clothes.  As a result, they must spend more time increasing their production possibilities.  However, right now they face their competition by producing their products one by one and responding to each customer in accordance with their personal situation and the personality that they want to project.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Carlos' first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he will use it to buy fabric, buttons and accessories in larger quantities because they are preparing new designs and already have orders for them from their good customers.

is a married woman who lives in Negros Oriental, Philippines. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: electronic games and a general store. Her husband Enorciso, who is 56 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living.  They have seven children who are 17 to 31 years old. Rosalinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to pay for an additional game unit and stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for a future business expansion. Rosalinda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

They have two children who are 33 and 34 years old. Arsenia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Arsenia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future needs of her family. Arsenia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

She earns her living by operating a pig fattening business and a fishing business. Her husband Leonardo, who is 36 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living.  They have two children who are 9 and 11 years old. Olivia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Olivia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 to buy feed, medicines and fishing gear so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Olivia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

is a married woman who lives in Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  pig fattening and poultry. Her husband Homer, who is 40 years old, works as an Operator (OFW) to earn his living.  They have four children who are between 9 and 19 years old. Naomi joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Naomi has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy piglets so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and house repairs. Naomi is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

Radhika M. T. is married and has three  children aged 30, 24 and 19.  In 1995, she established  her business selling cow's milk.  Working seven days a week and five hours each day, she supports her family.  Radhika has already received and repaid six loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent one to buy a young milk-giving cow.  In the future, Radhika plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. <p>\r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  <p>\r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our

is a married woman who lives in Cebu, Philippines. She earns her living by operating a general store and a fish vending business.  Her husband Emelio, who is 56 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living. They have five children who are between 19 and 31 years old. Lilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 to buy more stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for future space in the market for her fish vending business. Lilia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

She is one of those early birds, who catch the worm before others do. In spite her age Aisalkyn still devotes much time and energy to her farming. Aisalkyn and her husband, a pensioner, live on their own while the youngest of their three children helps in the household. They live in Tup, a rural area that does not have any industry or trade potential. Instead, the major occupations for local residents are agriculture and cattle breeding. The farmers cultivate not only traditional vegetables, fruits, and grain crop, but also try to innovate new exotic types of agricultural products. Aisalkyn, along with other group members, is getting ready to begin spring fieldwork. She grows mainly vegetables in large amounts, because she was fortunate to acquire a large plot of land in 1996. Large profits are gained in fall, when the harvest is gathered. Her monthly income is 3,000 soms. Aisalkyn led this group in applying for this loan because she needs funds to purchase potato seeds for the upcoming season. \r\n\r\n        --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She and her husband Kushbak have run a family business for 11 years buying, fattening and reselling cattle. The oldest of their four sons does his best to help his parents in this difficult work. \r\n\r\nPrior to starting the business, the family sold vegetables and fruits in a local bazaar, but due to declining profits they switched to cattle, a move that has made possible major repairs to the house. With a monthly income of about 6000 soms, Nasiba is requesting a loan to purchase additional heads of cattle. Her dream is to open a recreation spot and have many tourists visit.<p>\r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<p>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She is from the village of Naganacan within Cauayan City, a part of Isabela province on the Mindanao islands. Rebecca raises pigs to fatten and sell. Rebecca has been in business for over twenty years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP every three months. Rebecca is also the group leader of a twelve-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2011, Rebecca joined ASKI to gain access to its financial services. Rebecca is requesting a loan, her first from ASKI, of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase piglets to raise and sell in the future. She plans to use any additional revenue generated to expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nAlalay sa Kaunlaran, Inc., or ASKI, is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and -women, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He has been practicing mixed farming for the last four years in Litein town in Rift Valley, Kenya. His farm produces milk, which he sells to the local market, and tea, which he sells to Finlay factory. He employs one farmhand. He also earns income from his motorcycle transport business.\r\n\r\nEdwin has requested a loan of 50,000 KES through Kiva partner Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. He says that this loan will enable him to acquire a quality dairy cow that will produce enough milk for sale.

37, is married with four children between the ages of 1 and 8. Two of the children are currently attending school. He is a dairy farmer from the town of Litein in Rift Valley, Kenya. He has been in the farming business for ten years and employs one farmhand. He solely depends on the income from his farm to provide for the basic needs of his family.\r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan of 60,000 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a motorcycle for transporting his milk to the market.
