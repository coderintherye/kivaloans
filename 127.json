He is a head of household who works tirelessly to improve the standard of living of his family, always looking for opportunities to help himself and his family get ahead.  For these reasons, he currently works selling wood at wholesale.  It is hard work, and involves first buying the eucalyptus trees so that later he himself can cut them down into smaller pieces of wood.  His primary tools are an electric saw and an axe.  Once Felix has finished cutting, he selects what he is going to move and the amount that will fit into his truck for transport.  Felix has been in this business for five years, and this actity has allowed him to support the education of his four children.  He also plants and tends to several crops, including potatoes, on his land.  Felix makes great efforts to see his family get ahead each and every day, which is why he always seeks opportunities that may help him in this endeavor.  He seeks a loan to buy more trees so he can take advantage of the upcoming winter season when trees are scarce.  He hopes to, in this way, stabilize his earnings and have the ability to produce a greater quantity of product to offer for sale. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nF\u00e9lix tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad y vive con  su esposa  y 4 hijos.

The earthquake ruined all of her furniture and caused severe damage to her business and house.  Amalia didn't give up and with enormous maternal instinct, she pulled strength from weakness and decided on picking herself up, requested a loan to restart her business, buying cosmetology (dyes, shampoos, combs, etc.) that will allow her to get back on track, which she has been on for more than 25 years.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<P><b>Translated from Spanish by Donald Allen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nAmalia C.

P. Mel\u00e9ndez lives in the small town of Armenia in the province of Sonsonate.  For five years now, Santos has been running a small business selling sandals and CDs.  He lives with his wife and four children, all of them school aged.  His large family gives him various costs and economic complications, but at the same time, it's family that gives him inspiration and a desire to advance.  The journey hasn't been easy; in the beginning Santos lacked work capital and no banking institution trusted him nor loaned him money. This forced him to borrow money from individual lenders that sometimes charged him interest costs much higher than that of the loan itself.  With courage and faith in himself Santos never stopped believing in his dream.  Santos P. dreams about opening a store selling milk products and clothing, which will guarantee a decent education for his children.  For now, Santos is looking to expand his business.  This is the reason why he is requesting a loan to buy more sandals and CDs, which will help his small shop to grow and develop.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Donald Allen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nSantos P.

Junto a \u00e9l, viven su esposa y cuatro hijos, todos peque\u00f1os y todos estudiantes en la escuela. Su amplia familia le provoca m\u00faltiples gastos y complicaciones econ\u00f3micas, pero a la vez, es la misma familia, quien se vuelve su inspiraci\u00f3n y fuerzas de avanzar. El camino no ha sido f\u00e1cil, pues en sus inicios, Santos carec\u00eda de capital de trabajo, y ninguna instituci\u00f3n bancaria confiaba en el, ni le prestaba dinero. Esto lo forz\u00f3 a prestar dinero a prestamistas individuales, que le cobraban tasas de intereses a veces m\u00e1s altas que el pr\u00e9stamo mismo. Con valor y fe en s\u00ed mismo, Santos nunca dejo de creer en su visi\u00f3n. Santos P. sue\u00f1a con abrir una venta de de l\u00e1cteos y ropa, que garantice a sus hijos, una educaci\u00f3n decente. Por  ahora, Santos busca expandir su negocio. Es por esto que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s sandalias y cd\u00b4s, que ayuden al crecimiento y desarrollo de su peque\u00f1a

He lives in a polygamous family with two spouses, his children and his relatives in the Bamannankin district of Ouelessebougou (one of the subprefectures of the Koulikoro region).  He has worked as a butcher for 12 years.  This is a family profession and he learned it from his father who was also a butcher.  He runs this business at the Ouelessebougou market located along the road connecting Mali and the Republic of the Ivory Coast.\r\nConcerned about expanding his business and faced with an ever-growing demand, Mr. Kant\u00e9 decided to go to the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution.

The steers are slaughtered and sold as retail to a clientele made up primarily of women and restaurant owners.  The slaughtering takes place every two days.  Mr. Zoumana Kant\u00e9 runs a very profitable business and hopes to earn an average monthly profit of 135,000F CFA.

For this reason, he had to abandon his studies and start making money to provide for his family. He was trained as a tailor by several master tailors in the city of Sikasso. After 17 years of experience, he became a master tailor known all over Sikasso. His workshop, located in the grand market, is a melting pot of styles and designs, and is very much visited by a diverse clientele.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy an increasing number of ever more demanding requests from his customers, he decided to join the loan program of the microfinance organisation Soro Yiriwaso, in order to buy a new embroidery machine, seven pieces of tinted \"bazin\" (a sort of damask) in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali), and 200 meters of men's fabric in Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso, Western Africa). He intends to sew them to make shirts and trousers, that he will then sell. Due to an interesting profit margin, Mr. O. expects to make a profit of 150.000 XOF, to be used mainly to meet his family expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":198269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","use":"To buy a new embroidery machine and fabrics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-09-09T15:10:57Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sidiki","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-23T16:35:05Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":43750},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":43750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":97,"local_amount":43806.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-29T07:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":43908.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":370001,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for Soro Yiriwaso, a partner of Save the Children - Oct 23, 2008)"},{"amount":96.75,"local_amount":43693.55,"processed_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":43795.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350942,"comment":null},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":43851.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974005,"comment":null},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":43851.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889378,"comment":null},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":43851.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440171,"comment":null},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":43851.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135539,"comment":null},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:09Z","rounded_local_amount":43851.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033340,"comment":null},{"amount":96.86,"local_amount":43750,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":43851.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620761,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-09T16:35:05Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":63450,"name":"Bernadette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Bernadette in Kacyiru, Rwanda!

After separating from her husband 12 years ago, Justiniana found it a good idea to use her life savings to open a small store in her home.  That same business has enabled her to provide for her two children throughout the years.  Justiniana likes to man the store, although being there all day every Monday through Saturday makes her tired.  She wants to see her sons become professionals, and that\u2019s why she puts so much effort into her work.  With the loan that she will receive, Justiniana will be able to purchase more merchandise in order to supply her store and thereby help her business grow, making it larger and more profitable.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Debra Faszer-McMahon, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nJustiniana tiene 44 a\u00f1os, es divorciada, vive con sus dos hijos; Jos\u00e9 de 15 y Nilton de 10, los cuales son estudiantes.

On average, he makes around $2 profit each day. This couple together has only one child. Mrs. Path would like to request a loan from Kiva to purchase a trailer for her husband.
