is a 30-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a sari-sari (general) store.  She lives in Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000.  Rosalie is borrowing PHP 23,000 so that she can continue to fund her business operations. This will be her 26th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 25,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rosalie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in her own house in the company of her husband, Marcos, and three of their seven children.  For the last 10 years Elizabeth has sold perishables in her grocery store located at home.  She has also sold beauty products from even before her grocery store.  She does well in both activities so feels very motivated to continue working.  She likes dedicating all her time to her businesses because thanks to the profits from them she was able to pay for her older children\u2019s education, who are now professionals; she only still has the last three to go.  Because of this, this enterprising mother works with much responsibility and knows that she can count on your support and that\u2019s her greatest security.  She is, therefore, convinced that she can continue building a second story on her house and provide higher education to all her children.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP and she promises to pay all her installments on time because she does not want to disappoint all the people who made the loan possible that will allow her to stay in business seeking progress.\r\n\r\nElizabeth invests in food items weekly for her business so will use the requested loan to buy rice, noodles and oil at wholesale.  She will also buy cement and sand to finish building her house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":717214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy stock items for her store as well as cement and sand to finish building her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-21T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":204.81},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":205.15},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":217.15},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":219.4},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":237.53},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":241.51},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":251.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":263.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":274.39},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":284.16},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":295.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":304.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.1},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.22},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.62},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.45},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.09},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.56},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.21},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.74},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.61},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.19},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75.1,"local_amount":204.81,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":207.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327754,"comment":null},{"amount":75.22,"local_amount":205.15,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":207.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196277,"comment":null},{"amount":79.62,"local_amount":217.15,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":220.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269958,"comment":null},{"amount":80.45,"local_amount":219.4,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:17Z","rounded_local_amount":222.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549972,"comment":null},{"amount":87.09,"local_amount":237.53,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":240.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718652,"comment":null},{"amount":88.56,"local_amount":241.51,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-18T08:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":244.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350072,"comment":null},{"amount":92.45,"local_amount":252.14,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":255.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850624,"comment":null},{"amount":96.94,"local_amount":264.38,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":267.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665851,"comment":null},{"amount":100.17,"local_amount":273.2,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":276.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621023,"comment":null},{"amount":104.19,"local_amount":284.16,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":287.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835220,"comment":null},{"amount":220.21,"local_amount":600.57,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":608.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245016,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-23T08:04:51Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":275572,"name":"Graciela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cCAPAC QOYA\u201d;

His land contains cocoa and coffee plantations, with plants that are native to the R\u00edo Apurimac Valley woodlands. At harvest time he needs a helping hand from contracted day laborers in order to proceed with harvesting  the beans.

He believes that the hardest part of his job is transporting his produce from the farm to the warehouses located in the district of San Francisco, where he is offered better prices for his coffee and cocoa beans. In the future, he wishes to buy new lands and sow more cocoa plants using more modern methods so that he can produce organic cocoa. This is his tenth loan with MFP; he feels that this support will greatly help him to continue with his work, and he is wiling to comply punctually with his repayment schedule. He will use the 3000 Nuevo Soles to contract workers to harvest the coffee beans.    \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":717268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To employ day laborers to help him harvest coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-21T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaimer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":247.79},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":210.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":221.48},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":226.49},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":237.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":241.06},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":253.89},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":262.78},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":270.68},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":281.45},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":290.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":255.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.86},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.3},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.21},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.05},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.96},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.39},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.09},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.35},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.2},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":91.08,"local_amount":248.4,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":251.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327756,"comment":null},{"amount":77.83,"local_amount":212.27,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":215.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196279,"comment":null},{"amount":87.17,"local_amount":237.73,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":240.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269960,"comment":null},{"amount":81.77,"local_amount":223.01,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":226.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549974,"comment":null},{"amount":85.79,"local_amount":233.98,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":237.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718653,"comment":null},{"amount":88.17,"local_amount":240.47,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":243.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350074,"comment":null},{"amount":95,"local_amount":259.09,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":262.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850626,"comment":null},{"amount":91.18,"local_amount":248.66,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":252.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665853,"comment":null},{"amount":104.31,"local_amount":284.49,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":288.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621025,"comment":null},{"amount":103,"local_amount":280.91,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":284.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835222,"comment":null},{"amount":194.7,"local_amount":530.99,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:06Z","rounded_local_amount":538.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245018,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-22T00:52:59Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":275595,"name":"Luz Aurora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal\u201d CHASKA \u00d1AHUI\u201d;

He is a cheerful, hard working young man.  He cohabits with Sarita, 18, who is 8 months pregnant.  They live together in their own house where peace and concord reign.\r\n\r\nJhony is a very responsible young man who is very knowledgeable in his work: he\u2019s a farmer.  His parents taught his this occupation when he was quite young and since then he\u2019s worked his own field for the last four years.  He has three hectares producing the following crops: cocoa beans, coffee and bananas.  During harvest time he hires day laborers to help.  He is quite aware that this contribution he\u2019s getting is to produce good quality fruit.  He sells his cocoa beans and coffee in the city of San Francisco because that\u2019s where the best prices for these grains are available.\r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys the most about his work is harvesting because that\u2019s when the long months of hard work bear fruit in the good quality of his crops.  Transporting his products from the fields to the drying spaces is the most difficult part of the job.  For later on he\u2019d like to purchase new fields and plant coffee and cocoa beans.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.  He feels the loan will help him a lot with the progress of his work and he\u2019s willing to repay in a timely fashion.  He thanks Prisma for granting the loan.  He will use the requested 2000 new soles to buy food items to start a new business selling groceries.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":717284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy food items to start a new business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-21T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhony ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":175.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":174.69},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":182.98},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":187.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":195.95},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":201.52},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":207.76},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":217.93},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":224.22},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":231.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.6},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.02},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.03},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.05},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.32},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.99},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.28},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":63.6,"local_amount":175.46,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":175.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327758,"comment":null},{"amount":63.33,"local_amount":174.69,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":175.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196280,"comment":null},{"amount":66.33,"local_amount":182.98,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269961,"comment":null},{"amount":68.02,"local_amount":187.71,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":188.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549975,"comment":null},{"amount":71.03,"local_amount":195.88,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":196.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718654,"comment":null},{"amount":74.12,"local_amount":204.48,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":204.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350075,"comment":null},{"amount":75.45,"local_amount":208.15,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":208.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850627,"comment":null},{"amount":78.27,"local_amount":215.93,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":216.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665854,"comment":null},{"amount":164.85,"local_amount":454.72,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":455.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621026,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-22T03:51:50Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":275602,"name":"Jorge Ra\u00fal","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio pertenece al banco comunal \u201cCHASKA \u00d1AHUI\u201d;

He cohabits with Zelmira, 24, and they have two children, Yasmin, 5, and Kelvin, 1.  They all live together in their own house in the community of Santa Rosa, an annex of Anco district.\r\n\r\nJorge works as a farmer; he has cocoa bean and coffee crops.  His parents taught him how to till the land and thanks to that today he has his own fields.  He is well aware of how hard field work is; he\u2019s been doing it for 10 years.  During harvest time he hires day laborers who transport the harvested products a certain distance to be sold.  He is very committed to his job because thanks to his daily efforts today he enjoys watching his plants develop thus earning good profits.  He also tells us that he doesn\u2019t much enjoy the winter season because insects are plentiful and rain is constant making productive work impossible.  In time, he\u2019d like to buy more land and vary his crops to provide his family with a good economic stability.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP and he feels it will help his business\u2019 progress a lot and is willing to repay in a timely fashion.  He thanks Prisma for granting the loan.

Era ya muy conocida en su puesto, pero a veces sufr\u00eda  por el desalojo de los polic\u00edas municipales  por ser vendedora informal y, eso le hacia perder sus ventas. Por ello poco a poco busc\u00f3 y encontr\u00f3 asociarse en un mercado de frutas, desde entonces trabaja m\u00e1s segura durante 15 a\u00f1os, y con estas ganancias educ\u00f3 a sus hijos que ahora son profesionales.

In the previous cycle, the group ran into problems because two of its members did not fulfill their loan payments. However, with much effort they all managed to recover. The group is made up of 15 enterprising women who do their best to increase their incomes and to provide the best for their respective families. All the women are hard workers and have invested their loans in their individual businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nGladys is the president of the group. Every day she leaves her house at dawn in order to sell fruit to housewives before they decide to go to the store. She goes house to house and wants to own her own stand because everyone knows her for the high quality of her products. She needs the loan to buy more fruit to sell so she can increase her income and achieve her goals. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":717409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"to buy seasonal fruits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Paraguari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26 -57.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salustia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raimunda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirtha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ismelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ramona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":8992911,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":562057},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":562056}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":5058513,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-22T08:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":5119110.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202122396,"comment":null},{"amount":500,"local_amount":2248228,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2275160.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206159130,"comment":null},{"amount":375,"local_amount":1686170,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:20:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1706369.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211232119,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-03-02T20:12:04Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:20:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":275644,"name":"Betty Judith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Betty de 53 a\u00f1os de edad vive con su c\u00f3nyuge e el barrio La Magdalena; ella  tiene un negocio de peluquer\u00eda, donde tambi\u00e9n vende  a sus clientes productos capilares entre otros que resaltan la belleza e imagen femenina y masculina.

It is considered to be one of the most important urban, demographic, administrative, financial, and commercial centers in Chile, just behind Santiago and Valparaiso."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2775,"image":{"id":717418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase honey ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Concepci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-02-25T16:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margot ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"H\u00e9ctor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teobaldo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estrella ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guacolda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Myriam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magnolia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tailor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1291250,"loan_amount":2775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":90625},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":88822},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89410},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":89982},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90571},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":91143},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":91732},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":92322},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":92928},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":93535},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":94125},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94732},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":95357},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":95966}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.76},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.89},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.65},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.14},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.41},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.71},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.01},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.59},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.93},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":385.65,"local_amount":179447,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":180675.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195839764,"comment":null},{"amount":973.18,"local_amount":452838,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":455939.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201282256,"comment":null},{"amount":801.41,"local_amount":372910,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":375463.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206150263,"comment":null},{"amount":614.76,"local_amount":286055,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":288014.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211223346,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-25T23:25:33Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":275662,"name":"Shamshad Khusi Muhammad's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shamshad has lived in a small city in Punjab, Pakistan, called Kot Radha Kishen, for the past 12 years.

Mel\u00e9ndez is 54 years old and has two children, ages 28 and 30.  Through her own efforts, she was able to study and gradually become successful in whatever she pursued.  This woman lives in the town of San Jacinto in the Department of Bolivar, where she uses her loom to produce beautiful handicrafts such as hammocks and woven handbags.  Many foreigners and Colombian residents are familiar with these items and have them in their homes and businesses.  This trade is a tradition among the people of San Jacinto, so Vitelia continues the legacy.  For the past eight years, she has been making bags, backpacks, individual table settings, as well as student uniforms.\r\n<p>\r\nVitelia started her business after she won some prize money.  She invested it in materials for making bags.  Vitelia hired artisans and began generating sales, first in San Jacinto, and then she gradually opened new markets to the south in the Department of Bolivar and other cities in Colombia.  Now when she ships products to her customers, they deposit their payments into her savings account.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a mother and head of household, Vitelia is proud of being able to overcome challenges and move her children forward with the help of her business.  She dreams of seeing them advance so that they can become successful professionals.  Vitelia gives thanks to God that her situation has changed.  Her son completed his studies and is now a teacher who contributes to the household income.  Vitelia\u2019s other son works since everyone is able to help.  She owns her home and is able make repairs with the help of her children and the income from all of their efforts.  By sustaining her business, she is able to keep herself employed.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she will use the funds to buy yarn for making bags, five bales of wool, fabric used for lining the bags, slide fasteners, and clasps.  This investment promises to be a success because Vitelia is always able to sell what she produces in the city or ship her products to other regions of the country where her customers can hardly wait to see what she has created.  Her business has three employees who work with her in her home.  The products are sold to stores in the community as well as to customers in the south in the Department of Bol\u00edvar and other towns along the Caribbean coast.  Vitelia\u2019s business has very good cash flow.  Her accounts indicate that she is able to collect payments each week.  Most of her sales are made in cash, while almost all of her purchases for materials are paid in cash.

C. is 53 years old and her business is selling men's, women's and children's clothes from a spot in the center of Barranquilla, in an area that is has a lot of foot traffic.  Vilma started her business 16 years ago when she arrived in the city of Barranquilla from the town of Fundaci\u00f3n, in Magdalena department as her son wanted to enter university to continue his studies.  Vilma decided to sell sheets and towels that a lot of acquaintances ordered and she offered her goods on credit.  Over time, she expanded her inventory and added other merchandise such as socks, children's outfits and men's, women's and children's underwear.  However, she has always been supported by her husband in all her projects in life and this inspires her to keep going.\r\n\r\nVilma approached Fundaci\u00f3n Leon 2000 to request her first loan as she would like to achieve her dream of owning a business where she doesn't pay rent.  For this reason, she will use her Kiva loan, which is also her first loan, to pay for the spot where she sells her merchandise and which she doesn't currently own.  She tells us that her investment will be very successful because she won't have to pay rent for her spot and this will help her to reduce the price of her products and she will reach a larger volume of competitive sales.  It will also give her the personal satisfaction of making progress in her growth as a businesswoman.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":965.81,"image":{"id":717521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To

When he was 26 years old he became independent and purchased a plot of land with the money he earned working the fields.\r\n\r\nToday he cultivates corn and beans, sowing in the winter and the summer because his fields have a source of water. \r\n\r\nHe requests a loan to purchase 2 packages of urea, 1 package of complete fertilizer, and to cover labor costs. The loan will help him secure a good corn harvest. \r\n\r\nAmong his plans for the future is to keep cultivating the land. His next goal is to purchase another plot of land and to purchase 2 bulls to avoid paying to have the land tilled. His goal is to provide his children with a dignified home for them to live and to support them in their studies, something he was not able to do.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":717608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase agricultural products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-02-22T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaoquin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":340.46,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":340.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":340.46,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238663231,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-02-22T21:38:58Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:54:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":275743,"name":"Delicia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

The group consists of eight members.  This Communal Association is led by its Board of Directors.  At the head of the Board is the President, Sra. Daysi.  The members of the Communal Association engage in various businesses so that they can get ahead.  These incluD. making dinnerware to use as gifts, sewing garments, selling sausages and potatoes from a kiosk, selling American brands of clothing, selling quilts, selling vegetables, and making clothing for pets.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Daysi, the President of the Communal Association, said that she has been a member of \u201cAngoritas\u201d for approximately a year and a half and has participated in three loan cycles.  During this time, she has managed a business selling hamburgers and \u201csalchipapas\u201d (sausages and fried potatoes).  Sra. Daysi did not have a business before.  She used her first loan to buy supplies she needed to start her business such as bread, potatoes, oil, sausages, meat, and paper sacks.  The loan for this cycle will be used to buy supplies in bulk, thus allowing her to save some money.  Whenever the ladies purchase in bulk, the unit cost per item is less.  \r\n<p>\r\nDaysi conducts her sales from a kiosk she borrowed from her aunt.  Her business is open on Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.  By working to this schedule, she is able to take care of her five children.  Her greatest challenge is leaving them alone since her husband is deceased.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Daysi said she enjoys the opportunity to receive a loan with a group guarantee since she currently has no other type of guarantee.  In addition, she has been treated well by the staff and is excited about continuing ahead.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe photo shows nine adults because the mother of one of the members (the woman in the front row who is knitting) was present at this meeting.

They have seven children who are between 16 and 35 years old. Sarma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sarma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 24,000 to buy additional stocks for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Sarma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

R. is from the village of Kimanait, Pangantucan, Bukidnon. She is 43 years old. Marife is married and has 5 adult-aged children. To make a living, Marife owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and raising pigs for sale. She also runs a retail store which sells assorted products. Marife has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marife joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Marife has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Marife is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to expand her business by purchasing stock for her store. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Marife from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her businesses. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Gina is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to rent land to raise additional crops. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Gina from HSPFI.

When she began, Mamlekat had only a few calves. Later, her livestock grew and she obtained milk cows and was able to sell dairy products for a small profit.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nGloria is married and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Gloria owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Gloria has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Gloria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gloria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. Gloria is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase young livestock to raise & sell in the future. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Gloria from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

E. is from the village of Upper Carmen, Cagayan de Oro City. He is 27 years old. Ramel is married and has 2 infant-aged children. To make a living, Ramel owns & operates a business venture in the services sector providing recycling services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling plastics & other recyclables for local businesses and community members. Ramel has been engaged in his business for over 2 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ramel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ramel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Ramel is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional plastics & other recyclables to sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Ramel from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in Toledo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 2,900. Laurita is borrowing PHP 10,000 to fund the operations of her business. This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Laurita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,600,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her third cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, to buy products for resale so that she can continue to save up for future education and improvement of business. Ailaine is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy medicine and fertilizer for her vegetable garden so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children and expansion of her garden.

is a married woman who lives in the municipality of Carmen, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  food production\/sales and selling soft drinks. Her husband Carlos, who is 40 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. They have five children who are between 7 and 14 years old. Analiza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Analiza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Analiza is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Quezon, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a fish vending business. Her husband Rosaldo works as a truck driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 7 and 22 years old. Rowena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rowena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 17,000 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 21st  loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Rowena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 25-year old single woman who supports her family by operating a fish vending business. She lives in Narra, Palawan. Sheena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her first loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sheena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,200, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her second loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy more fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her children's education. Sheena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Rizal, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a general store and a fish vending business.  Her husband Fausto, who is 56 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 10 and 31 years old. Rosalia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500 uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000 to buy more goods to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Rosalia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Rosita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to purchase more goods to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and to have a tricycle for transportation.

Year in and year out, she managed to broaden her business by widening her assortment of goods.  She also paid for the education of her daughter in China\r\n  \r\nBut in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in the Osh city, Elmira lost her business, which was robbed and looted. Her husband, who supported and helped her in all activities, was injured in a shootout during the clashes and died.  This tragedy became a hard blow for Elmira\u2019s family and children.\r\n\r\nHowever, Elmira isn't giving up.  She is ready to resume her lost business and continue to work. For this very reason, Elmira is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her business selling women's clothes. She plans to rent a selling point at the local market.

is 52 years old, married and supports her family by fish vending and buying and selling of firewood.  She lives in Aborlan, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her two businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000. Erlinda is borrowing PHP 17,000 to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

is a married woman who lives in Narra, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a general store and a fishing business. Her husband Larry, who is 37 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 8 and 10 years old. Evelyn  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her first loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Evelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her second loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for future improvement of business. Evelyn  is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a married woman who lives in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a fish vending business. Her husband Bonifacio, who is 58 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 24 and 28 years old. Merilene joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Merilene has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for house repairs. Merilene is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
