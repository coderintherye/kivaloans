This situation led her husband to make a hard decision to leave his family in search of a job and better earnings abroad, a decision that thousands of other Moldovans have also reached.

He is a widower.  He has 1 son.  He has a high school education.  Abdumavlon fattens and sells livestock.  Abdumavlon has a flock of small livestock composed of approximately 35 sheep and 15 goats.  Abdumavlon takes the flock out to the mountains every morning, tends it and in the evening brings it back.  For now, Abdumavlon has few heads of large livestock, but he would like to use this loan to purchase two medium bulls.  After fattening them for 3-4 months he will be able to sell them for a very good price.  Abdumavlon is very happy to work with us, because he thinks that the credit will help him.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":312604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Fatten and sell cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Taboshar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.568889 69.640278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-12T02:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdumavlon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":837.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001037,"comment":null},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":837.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846265,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-05-20T09:34:32Z","paid_date":"2009-12-25T09:21:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":105813,"name":"Theresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theresa is 54 years old and married with four children.

Not having attended school for societal reasons, she soon became interested fifteen years ago in earning an income to support herself through such work as small-scale commerce.  Highly experienced, she is appreciated and in much demand in Koutiala.   These days, Kadidia is leaning a lot more towards the wholesale distributing and selling of <i>ati\u00e9k\u00e9<\/i> (a cassava or yam foodstuff).  \r\n<p>\r\nConcerned about satisfying her customers, Kadidia turned toward the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two years ago.  After having settled an initial loan successfully, she envisions a second individual loan for a 12-month period in the amount of 500,000 francs CFA.  With this loan, she intends to resupply herself with a sizable stock of goods from Cote d\u2019Ivoire mostly for the retailers of <i>ati\u00e9k\u00e9<\/i> of Koutiala City.  In addition to restocking, she sells retail, aimed at consumers at the grand marketplace of Koutiala.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a profit of 150,000 francs CFA that will be used to make loan payments and to care for her children.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":312614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy supplies of \"ati\u00e9k\u00e9\"","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020245,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678786,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028176,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763277,"comment":null},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991007,"comment":null},{"amount":170.85,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746132,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T04:14:27Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":105825,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace sells stationery and drinks in her community in Lagos State, Nigeria.

Supplies are gotten in Burkina Faso and at the grand marketplace of Sikasso City.  The merchandise is sold in mostly retail cash transaction to customers composed of men and women at different marketplaces in the city, in their homes, and in the area going door-to-door.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members each envision realizing an average monthly profit of 15,500 franc CFA.  A portion of the profits will be used for family needs (savings account), and the other portion will be invested in business.

Basilisa A., Pabla A., Fermina C., and Benigna A. sell meals; Andrea M., Mar\u00eda Angela B., Mar\u00eda Evergista B., and Mar\u00eda Benita Ben\u00edtez sell household goods and hardware supplies; Felicita Pav\u00f3n, Clara B., Carmen D., and Perla L\u00f3pez sell clothing; Elva A. sells vegetables; Sofia E. sells fruit; and Norma D. runs a corner store.\r\n\r\nAll of the group's members are very happy that, thanks to this opportunity, their incomes have risen and they have been able to better their children's quality of life. Having easy access to credit and working capital has made a huge difference for the group, and because they value this, they are very committed to communal banking. They work in solidarity with one another as a team and work to understand and support one another. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

Some of them will use their loan to begin or continue building a house; others to pay either for themselves to pursue further studies or pay for their children\u2019s education. Some will use the loan to invest in businesses in order to complement their monthly salaries. And still, others will use theirs to buy pieces of furniture.<P>\r\n\r\nJohn B.

By trade she is a weaver, \"making typical skirts for women\". She has a workshop with two looms and lives together with her children.

They have just finished moving into their new home. Ever since he was a child, he has been involved in agriculture. He grows peas and potatoes for a living. His crops have always done well because he is constantly fertilizing them, which requires a lot of investment. Despite how arduous his work is, he is happy at the end of the day because it is the only thing he knows how to do and his sole source of income. Amalio stresses that in order to harvest good crops for the demanding market, it takes a lot of sacrifice and it generally depends on the weather. He grows crops on seasonal farms, so he is subject to climate factors. For this reason, his goal is to obtain irrigated lands in which he does not have to invest too much to grow his crops. Amalio has been a very responsible client during the 9 consecutive months that he has been working with MFP.

She lives in her home with her only son, Carlos, who is 19 years old and to whom she hopes to give a good college education.  Selling clothing is a very profitable business for Felicia because her articles of clothing sell quickly and her merchandise is constantly turning over.  She is a very capable vendor who always receives her clients with a smile on her face.  She has been working in this job for 7 years and the part she likes best is chatting with her fellow vendors.  This keeps her up-to-date on what's happening in the neighborhood.  The hardest thing for her is bringing the clothing from Desaguadero (Puno district) because it's costly and tiring.  But even so, she doesn't lose hope of making her businesses progress, and in the future have her own store where she will be able to sell her textile products in more comfort. \r\n\r\nThis is Felicia's second loan with MFP.

is a woman who tries her best to give her family a better life.

She is requesting a loan of PHP10,000.00 as additional working capital for her business, so that she can buy products to sell and increase her income. She believes that if she has more products she can earn more profit.\r\n\r\nHer family lives peacefully in Barangay Minanga Sur Iguig, Cagayan. She is already a widow and strives hard to support her family's immediate needs. Her children are Carlota, 44 years old and Rodrigo, 41 years old, and they are both married and have their own families. Estelita works patiently to support the needs of her children and to provide a good education for her grandchildren.

M. is 28 years old and a mother of a four year old child named Jim-Owen, who is entering kindergarten. Her husband is a local proprietor of a furniture business in their village. They are happily living in Barangay Minanga Sur Iguig, Cagayan. Kathleen sells different kinds of vegetables to help her husband provide for their basic needs. \r\n\r\nKathleen plans to make their businesses more productive, and to accomplish this, Kathleen wants to borrow a loan of PHP5,000.00 for additional capital for their furniture and vending businesses. The amount will be a big help for the development of their businesses and to increase their income. Their daily income of PHP200.00 is not enough to provide for all their family's needs, and that is why she really hopes to improve their businesses with the additional capital she is requesting. She will use the loan to buy wood and other materials to manufacture more furniture that they will able to sell. Also, the loan will be used to buy more vegetable products for her vending business. Through this loan, they will be able to send their child to school and hopefully finish a college course some day. She believes that through her patience and sacrifices, God will make a way for them to attain their goals in life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":313162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture
