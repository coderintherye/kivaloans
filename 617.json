It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Saleh hopes to expand his business and to have a beloved family of his own in the future.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":747,"image":{"id":796311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"to buy extra coffee and sugar with special prices","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Tyre","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2011-06-21T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saleh","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:08:16Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221603633,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226973060,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232731174,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238534709,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-28T08:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244494233,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-17T08:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250702334,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:19:55Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257299274,"comment":null},{"amount":83,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317264,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-02T22:51:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":309130,"name":"Shonazar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shonazar is a hardworking man.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

has been in the business of cattle ranching for the last 30 years. The breeding business requires a lot of dedication and effort since it requires the strict control of every one of the animals, including feed and care for those that are older. Through this business, Rahmatullo is able to support his spouse and his four children. He is soliciting a loan through IMON International to buy more animals to raise and sell in the market. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Piglets are sold seasonally.\r\n\r\n Also in late spring and summer, Arkadi is busy with fishing. He fishes in lakes which are located nearby and sells approximately 100 kg of fish per month.

She is 42 years old and the mother of three children between 7 and 20 years of age. All of her children attend school. She went to school through the sixth grade but couldn't finish because her school was too far away. She and her family live in their own home, and she also supports her mother, sending her 1000 meticals a month.\r\nShe owns a tractor that she uses to do plowing and harvesting locally, which has allowed her to save up enough money to open her own business. Today she is also the owner of a retail establishment with two employees who earn 1500 meticals. The business provides profits of 6000 meticals a month, which she uses to cover household expenses.

All along her life she\u2019s learned to make the embroidery on \u201cfustanes\u201d (traditional skirts or petticoats) since this is a very commonplace activity in her area.  \r\n\r\nThree years ago she decided to work doing this artisanal embroidery.  She has, therefore, set aside space in her house for a workshop that she\u2019s equipped with tools like: sawhorses and embroidery frames.  Her work period is usually in the morning and she spends the afternoon taking care of her daughter.  She enjoys her work because she considers herself a very creative person for she applies novel designs and colors so that her embroidery will be attractive to her customers.  Besides, being done by hand adds value to her work and it\u2019s thus better paid.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan request at MFP; a girl friend invited her and encouraged her to become part of a communal bank.

He grows saplings every year and then sells them. In addition, he has a 0.3-hectare plot of the land where he grows strawberries. The harvested strawberries are sold on the local market. Tilling and fertilizing is essential for the land in order to get quality saplings. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Vazha plans to save for house renovation, as it is already old and needs some repair.

She has been in this business for approximately one year.  She started out offering her sewing services in nursery schools.  She then gave out information about her services in other places such as medical centers and provided information to individuals, offering to make shower curtains.\r\n\r\nHada buys her merchandise in the city of Angol in stores that sell sewing supplies, including fasteners, buttons, threads and fabric.  She used her loan to buy 37 meters of fabric for making borders (the top edge of a curtain).  In addition, she bought yarn since she also makes and sells scarves.  Her business has done very well.  She tells us that she always has orders, whether it be from individual customers or establishments that provide services to the community.\r\n\r\nHada's goal is to set up her business in established business premises where she can offer a range of products such as cushion covers, drapes, borders, christening robes, etc.  Her dream is to buy an overlock sewing machine as, right now, she only has an ordinary straight line machine.\r\n\r\nHada lives together with her husband and her 15 year-old daughter.  She is very grateful for the support provided by Fondo Esperanza and she feels very happy with the other members of her community bank since they have a very good relationship and are very united and supportive as a group.

She has a small warehouse of this raw material which is used a lot by her neighbors and her fellow bank members.  Our friend tells us that in order to buy the wood she has to travel to Picoaza, in Portoviejo canton, where she buys from farmers and salespeople who offer her a very good price.

Ainagul graduated from the Pedagogical University and worked at the school of Achy village as a librarian. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, her salary did not cover the expenses of her household at all. That\u2019s why, in 2004, using her start-up capital of 10,000 KGS, Ainagul started her business in trade. Year in and year out, she managed to broaden her business and earn about 30,000 KGS in a month. Her loyal customers were attracted by her optimistic attitude and cheerfulness. \r\n\r\nBut in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in the Osh city, Ainagu lost her business. Her sales place was robbed and looted. \r\n\r\nHowever, Ainagul isn't giving up and is ready to resume her lost business and continue to work. For this very reason, Ainagul is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her activity.

She is single but works hard to sustain herself. At this time, she is working hard to continually make enough for her everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nMary Ann operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, where groceries, toiletries and beverages are sold piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five Philippine pesos' (PHP) worth of cooking oil, or an egg. \r\n\r\nMary Ann earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also earns money through an electronic cellular phone loading station. What she does is to buy electronic cellular phone loads (minutes) in bulk, then resell them at retail. Her profit depends on the network's dealership policy. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 610 PHP in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 19,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She will also invest some of the loan to buy electronic loads from different local networks. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMary Ann hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to support her sister up to college level. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.
