She lives with her partner, Dan, with whom she has two children ages 16 and 14. They have their own home. Berita is a seamstress, a job that she learned at a very young age. She helped her cousin to to this work for three years, during which time she has been able to learn everything she needs to know to do this work, gain clientele, and become known. Then, she became independent and opened her own workshop in her home. Her customers' demand has increased, and she has now been working alone for six years. She enjoys being able to count in an income with which to cover her household costs, since her husband travels a lot--he is a gold miner and works in the jungle rivers. Berita does not enjoy the physical strain caused by the long hours of sitting in the same position, but this does not discourage her and she keeps working. In the future, she wants to expand her business and open a boutique in her home. This is her fourth loan with MFP. She feels comfortable with the members of her communal group; she considers them to be responsible and united people. With the amount requested, she will invest in the purchase of materials for sewing, such as fabric, thread, elastics, and buttons."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":368.64,"image":{"id":913975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"to buy fabric, thread, and buttons.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-11T17:40:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Berita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":229.79},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":238.35},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":237.43},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":256.09},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":265.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":272.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.36},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.02},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":88.09,"local_amount":229.79,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":238.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621990,"comment":null},{"amount":91.36,"local_amount":238.35,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:53Z","rounded_local_amount":246.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836072,"comment":null},{"amount":91.02,"local_amount":237.43,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":246.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245832,"comment":null},{"amount":98.17,"local_amount":256.09,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":265.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385865,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-17T16:48:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":356136,"name":"Rosmery","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosmery  es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cSanta Rosa de Lima\u201d, ubicado en el distrito Juli, provincia de Chucuito y departamento de Puno, tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente y tiene un hijo.

Elizabeth and her group joined One Acre Fund in 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program. \r\n\r\nElizabeth takes care of three children at home. She joined One Acre Fund for its low prices, to ensure food security for her family, and, later, to educate them. In the recent 2011 season, Elizabeth had an excellent maize yield harvesting 12 bags on \u00bd an acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Elizabeth was only able to harvest three bags of maize on \u00bd acres of land. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Elizabeth and her group during Kenya's next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund's integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Elizabeth will educate her children, build a house and invest in livestock rearing. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Bidii S.H.G. will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and one acre of land. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":913418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-14T16:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40950,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40950}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-15T11:00:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":356268,"name":"Chile","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chile is 33 years old and lives in Helen, Larena, Siquijor.

Teddy hopes that in the future she will be able to become a doctor. \r\n\r\nTeddy is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training.

is 17 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is single and has one child. For the past three years, Sofia has been working hard to manage her hotel, which sells food. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Sofia has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy food for cooking for resale and will help Sofia to generate greater profits and buy food to feed her family. Sofia hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nSofia is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Sofia's future prospects by helping to teach her job skills like hair dressing.

Nevless is 21 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. She is married and has three children, who are all currently in school. For the past three years, Nevless has been working hard to manage her wholesale shop, which sells beans and maize. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Nevless has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more beans and maize for resale, and will help Nevless to generate greater profits and pay for school fees herself. Nevless hopes that in the future, she will be able to buy a motorcycle. \r\n\r\nNevless is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Nevless' future prospects by helping to teach her job skills like hair dressing and how to save.

Plus Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cMo\u00efse Plus\u201d is a Community Bank made up of 23 micro entrepreneurs whose chairman is Emmanuel. These members are united and have the same goal to grow their businesses by loans received from Kiva through HOPE RDC. \nEmmanuel sells sacks of charcoal in his area located in the north eastern suburban part of Kinshasa. He began his business in 2004. After hard work and good management, he succeeded in making it thrive thanks to the accumulated profits. He is a loyal client of HOPE RDC who has already received two different loans and has repaid them properly. He intends to reinforce the working capital with the next loan by buying ten charcoal sacks to resell at a profit as people do not have power and hot plates in this area. The business gives him a profit of US$30 every week. Emmanuel is 32 years old, married and the father of four children whose ages vary between 1 and 9 years old. Two of them attend school.

His wife runs a small retail business (she sells essential goods).\r\nHe has never had loans in other banks. He first heard of Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client of this institution. This is his third loan with Hluvuku. It is for 16.000mt, which he intends to use to purchase construction supplies in order to make home improvements (window frames, doors, sanitary ware, etc.). The previous loans were for 6.000mt and 12.000mt, respectively for the retail business and for personal housing expenses.\r\nHe promises to repay according to the schedule. In the future he plans to finish building his house and to make more investments in his business. For those purposes he intends to request other loans from Hluvuku."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":161.39,"image":{"id":914393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase construction supplies in order to make home improvements (window frames, doors, sanitary ware, etc.).

Today, he operates a general boutique. He is 49 years old, married and has four children between the ages of 8 and 17. Three of them go to school.  His boutique has been strengthened thanks to the four different loans he has already received from MFI HOPE DRC, which he repaid properly. With a profit of about $45 earned per week, he plans with the next loan, to increase the inventory of his goods by purchasing items such as some soaps, sacks of sugar, cans, purified water, etc. for reselling at a profit in order to meet his customer\u2019s needs and make additional profits. Currently, Faustin is happy to be part of one of Hope\u2019s groups. He is determined to develop his business through the different loans he will be receiving from Kiva through MFI HOPE DRC.

Rakhim graduated from the Zafarabad Civil Engineering Technicum (Tajikistan) in 1998 with a degree in accounting and agricultural analysis. He worked until 2003 in the local administration. After leaving work in search of opportunities to ensure a future for his children, Rakhim decided to become involved in animal husbandry and horticulture. For 14,000 Kyrgyzstani som, he bought one cow, which began his own business. Today his business consists of three cows with calves and brings in around 12,000 som every month from the sale of dairy products. Also, when in season, Rakhim earns income from the sale of fruit grown in his personal garden. The income from his work has allowed Rakhim to buy a plot of land in order to build a home for his family. In order to further the growth of his business, Rakhim approached Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som to buy additional livestock.

In search of a financial support for his children, Turatbek started his animal husbandry (fattening up and reselling livestock) business.  Having started with an initial sum of 10,000 som (KGS), Turatbek was able to develop his business, which now has 4 cows, 20 sheep and 1 horse and a monthly profit of 12,500 som (KGS).  Turatbek sells fattened-up livestock at a livestock market.  His property also includes land, where he sows cereal crops and sainfoin.  He sells the harvest to his regular wholesale buyers.  In order to further increase his livestock headcount, Turatbek requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock for fattening up.  He plans to use the expected profit to stock up on fodder and hay for the winter in order to sell fattened up livestock at good prices in the spring.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":914441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase additional livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Issyk-Kol village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-11T19:30:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Turatbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1210}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-20T17:14:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":356448,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph has operated his butcher's shop in Nakuru town for the last six years.

Judith's work is tailoring. She makes all kinds of garments in response to orders from her clients, for men, women and children. She learned this profession when she signed up at an occupational education center. She had the economic needs of her household in mind, and she had a sewing machine as a tool, which she was able to acquire thanks to a loan she applied for eight years ago. What she likes about her work is being able to have an income to cover her household expenses, since she is now the only breadwinner in her family. She comments that she likes to sew -- she was already interested in it as a young girl -- and thanks to this opportunity she has a job. She has plans to expand her business and update it by purchasing another sewing machine so she can renovate the one she has. This will be her thirteenth loan with the MFP institution. She feels good about the work of her communal bank, since she can share with other people, and she thinks all of the members are good people.

She is married to Esteban and they live together in their own home with their two children, 18 and 15, and a nephew who they support in his schooling. \r\n\r\nRosa sells food at night like Peruvian fried rice, fried chicken, grilled chicken and other things. She sells them on a table in front of her house, where she tends to her customers. Her kids help her with this business. On the side, she also sells beer that she keeps in a freezer so she can sell them at the temperature that her customers like. She has been doing this for 6 years and it has given her an income so that she can help her husband with the costs of the home; often his public employee's salary does not cover their children's college studies. She feels productive and independent, and now wants to grow and consolidate her businesses. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 6th loan with MFP. She likes her work in the village bank and hopes to continue being a part of it.

He is married and has two children.\r\n\r\nSantos learned to farm when he was 10 years old.  It was his dad who taught him because they didn't have a regular job and he has several siblings.  In farming, they found a way of making a living and a way of life.  Santos currently sows corn with a gravity irrigation system as it is the dry season (a system through which water for irrigating the crops doesn't need any mechanisms, just gravity.  A slope is found for the water to run down and find its level, watering all the crops). However, when it rains, Santos says that they lose crops through flooding as the water is not very deep.\r\n\r\nSantos walks for fifteen minutes from his house to the main road where he boards a bus which takes thirty minutes to get to the city where he buys his farming supplies.\r\n\r\nSantos is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo so that he can buy 12 sacks of fertilizer, 80 pounds of corn seed, and other supplies that he needs to sow 14,000 square meters of corn which he waters with a gravity irrigation system and sells on the cob.\r\n\r\nBy purchasing his supplies all in one go, Santos obtains lower prices and avoids having to travel to buy in small amounts.  In addition, he will be certain that he can give his crops the care they need, when they need it.  This will allow his production to increase and also his income.\r\n\r\nSantos will work hard to build a house from brick as he currently lives in a house made from adobe which doesn't have internal room divisions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":914698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy 12 sacks of fertilizer, 80 pounds of corn seed and other supplies he needs to sow 14,000 square meters of corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T20:28:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":356590,"name":"Manuel Jos\u00e9","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A sus 63 a\u00f1os de edad Manuel Jos\u00e9 es un emprendedor dedicado a la recolecci\u00f3n de empaques, espec\u00edficamente costales, esta labor la desempe\u00f1a en su moto, logrando una mejor cobertura y optimizando los tiempos de transporte y comercializaci\u00f3n.\n\nActualmente genera 2 empleos, y con la ilusi\u00f3n de seguir progresando quiere comprar otra moto que le permita tener mas capacidad de recolecci\u00f3n y comercializaci\u00f3n, igualmente podr\u00e1 generar otro empleo, ayudar m\u00e1s con los gastos del hogar, y mejorar la dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica.
