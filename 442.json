Coffee is a highly lucrative cash crop that has helped many Ugandans to extricate themselves from poverty. William\u2019s story is typical -- he began his career as a dairy farmer, but soon switched to coffee because it presented greater opportunities. Today, his weekly profits come to about 50,000 Ugandan shillings. Though he is affected by changes in local and international coffee prices, his commitment to his crop has never wavered. He also believes that this prospects are bright, in part because of the revival of coffee-marketing unions in his area. His confidence is also strong because he continues to operate a small diary business, which means he has a diversified income source. He is applying for this loan to buy more coffee seedlings to plant, along with various pieces of equipment he needs to bring his crop to market.

three children.  Formerly in the farming business, for the past nine years Margret has operated a food produce enterprise selling products including beans, millet, sorghum, and maize in Rwentobo, enabling her to earn 400,000 Ugandan shillings on a monthly basis. <p>\r\n\r\nMargret works hard to meet her family responsibilities which include paying the school fees for her children and other necessities with help from her husband. To enlarge the scale of her business, she is requesting a loan to buy a larger stock of goods. This will enable her to increase her sales and live a more sustaining life as she looks to further business expansion and building a store. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":581349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase a larger stock of goods for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ntungamo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.916667 30.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-08-11T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mable","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Molly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joselyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Loy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2530000,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":632500},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":632500},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":632500},{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":632500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":293.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":293.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":632500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":645662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903725,"comment":null},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":632500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":645662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297191,"comment":null},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":632500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":645662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467466,"comment":null},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":632500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:27Z","rounded_local_amount":645662.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605556,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-15T19:53:49Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":221557,"name":"Selina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Selina C. is currently in the business of selling foodstuffs in a restaurant.

She is aged 48 years and is from Kitondo village, Rukungiri. Being such a determined, energetic and a hardworking lady, she worked tirelessly to start up the poultry business alongside the sale of bananas, which are commonly used to prepare a local dish by customers here in Uganda.\r\n\r\nShe is so fond of her enterprise, thus is always able to earn 1,500,000 Ugandan shillings (about $682) monthly through doing her daily business transactions both inside and outside Uganda, like transporting her goods to Rwanda. \r\n\r\nThis loan is to help her purchase chicken feeds and, furthermore, to expand the project to a large scale. This will help to improve Constance\u2019s yields and production, thus leading to an increase in sales revenue, which will enable her to enjoy a self-sustainable livelihood.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":581139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase chicken feeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ntungamo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.916667 30.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-08-11T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Constance","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brighton","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petience","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phiona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stera","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Winnifred","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6000000,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":458.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":458.34},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":458.33,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1007416.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903726,"comment":null},{"amount":458.34,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1007416.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297192,"comment":null},{"amount":458.33,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1007416.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467467,"comment":null},{"amount":459.71,"local_amount":1003000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1010438.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605557,"comment":null},{"amount":456.96,"local_amount":997000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1004394.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744675,"comment":null},{"amount":458.33,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1007416.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191482864,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-15T11:41:40Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:06:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":221560,"name":"Selina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Selina P. is currently in the business of selling maize flour, okra and eggplant and is requesting a loan to stock sweet potatoes and Irish potatoes to sell.\r\n\r\nSelina is 49 years old and is widowed.

Kiva borrower is a 31-year-old divorced woman from Lebanon. She lives with her parents and 3 siblings and contributes with her brothers to the household expenses. She started her business selling lingerie from her home. Today, she is the proud owner of a lingerie shop. She has been working hard in her store for the past four years. Today, she is requesting to borrow $1000 from Kiva's partner Ameen s.a.l. to further diversify her merchandise selection. She hopes that her varied selection of lingerie will continue to generate good profits and enable her to expand her business even further. She expects her productivity and income to increase in the coming year. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in her picture, not indicating her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

They live in the area of Pi\u00f1ami, in the province of Quillacollo, 10 km from the city of Cochabamba in an agricultural area on the edge of the city.\r\n\r\nAurelia raises cows for milk. She has five cows producing milk which she takes to be pasteurized to PIL (Planta Industrializadora de Leche), located about one kilometre from her property. As well as dairy farming, she also grows maize (corn) for sale. \r\n\r\nHer elderly husband Sr. Braulio suffers from Parkinson's, which has prevented him from helping with household duties, leaving Aurelia to do all the chores alone such as feeding the cows, looking after the pasture, milking the cows, buying supplies, and all the other necessary jobs that go along with her work. \r\n\r\nFortunately there is an NGO in Cochabamba that provides free assistance, such as physiotherapy, to people with this disease. This support is a help to them but they have to find the time to do the exercises. Amongst all her other chores, Aurelia has to take her husband to physiotherapy every day.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy food for the cows wishing to take advantage of the current low prices. While she knows that her husband will not recover completely because of his age, she must exhaust all possibilities and continue the daily struggle against this illness.\r\n<br

They have three sons: Pablo, 21, Luis Miguel, 16, in 9th grade, and Abel, the youngest, 12, who is about to start 6th grade and wants to become an Agronomist.\r\n\r\nShe is a housewife but also makes cheese, cream and cottage cheese.  She started this business two years ago.  She buys milk to curdle and thus make her products.  She comments that this activity has made it possible for her to get ahead because it is a profitable business that sells well because there are many persons who order from her in order to resell in other municipalities in the region; she also sells directly to residents of her area who buy from her because it\u2019s delicious, good quality, well priced, locally available cheese.\r\n\r\nShe was motivated to go into this work because she wanted to contribute to household income since her husband also works as a corn and bean farmer both for their own consumption and to sell.\r\n\r\nProfits from the cheese sales are used to buy more milk to make more cheese and are saved to help support the children\u2019s pursuit of their careers, something she wishes with all her heart and that together they build a large cheese factory where they can store the cheeses they make.\r\n\r\nShe became a member of the group thanks to the invitation from Mrs. Mar\u00eda Deysi who spoke about the program she represents.  The group is called \u201cEsperanza del Futuro\u201d (Hope for the Future).

They live together in the community of Santa Rosa, located in the tropical Peruvian rainforest, where they have their own home made of adobe.  Bertha has not been discouraged by the fact that she did not finish her studies.  Rather, this motivated her to gather her strength and will as a fighting woman, in order to face any obstacles that she encounters.  As a result of her constant efforts, she has been able to develop a business that has good economic results.  She grows and sells cocoa, and her customers feel satisfied with the quality of her product.  She wants to continue working in agriculture, as she feels happy with the work she is doing.  She receives help from her children during the planting and harvesting seasons, and she always works with her beloved husband.  They both work from 7:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening, and they make their sales for a fair price at the local gathering center.\r\n\r\nHer future plan is to diversify her products by growing coffee and citrus fruits, and in this way, to increase her income.

She has 3 children, 2 boys and 1 girl. Lisbeth is 11 years old and is at primary school, Adri\u00e1n is 6 years old and is going to start primary school, and Jos\u00e9 is one year old. She works selling products from a catalog and needs this loan to buy women's and men's scents, mascara, lipstick, makeup, and nail polish. She began her business 5 years ago when a woman invited her to sell products from the company Jafra. You can buy your order on credit, and when your order arrives, you have 28 days to pay for your products. Dolores goes door to door selling her products, her daughter helps her sell products to their neighbors. \r\nHer business is important because it helps pay the household expenses, and she also likes to go out and get distracted by her work for a while. She and her children can use the products. Her business faces competition from other brands and there are other people selling the same products. Dolores wants to buy a glass case to display her products and remodel her house by putting on a new roof. Her hope is that her children will continue studying so that the will be good people, hardworking and honest. She is very happy about the loan because she will receive supplies that she can offer to her clients. \r\nJaloxtoc is a very beautiful place where you can see the green countryside. \r\nThe group members are Dolores, who is going to buy perfumes for women, men, boys, and girls; lipsticks; and deodorants to stock her business; Maria, who is going to buy chicken meat to sell buy the kilo and stock her store; Rosalinda, who is going to buy trousers, blouses, skirts, dresses, and children's t-shirts to stock her store; Maricela, who is going to buy vegetables, tomatoes, potatoes, onion, fruits, watermelon, apples, bananas, mango, etc, to supply her fruit and vegetables stall; and Eva, who is going to buy quilts and sheets to start her business.\r\nThe group members want to tell Kiva and Fundac\u00edon \"thank you for the support that you provide to us.\"<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":580041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy products like perfumes for men and women, mascara, lipstick, makeup, and nail polish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"JALOXTOC, AYALA; MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-08-15T12:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolores ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.12},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":178.13,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854282,"comment":null},{"amount":534.37,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6757.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121180,"comment":null},{"amount":178.13,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415288,"comment":null},{"amount":178.12,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415289,"comment":null},{"amount":356.25,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4504.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554935,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-15T16:35:45Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":221597,"name":"Rodrigo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. L.

P. is 60 years old and lives the town of Coapilla in Ribera Llano Grande, State of Chiapas, M\u00e9xico.  She took the opportunity to get married at a young age, but unfortunately she does not have any children.  Her husband passed away ten years ago, leaving her alone with nobody to support her.\r\n<p>\r\nAurora stays at home where she manages a grocery store, selling sugar, beans, rice, oil, and other supplies.  She started this business and, thanks to God, has done well from doing a little bit of work.  Aurora has several customers who buy her products regularly since her store is in a good location and she provides good service.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe started this business out of necessity since she lives alone and is not able to depend on anyone.  Her neighbors encouraged to pursue this business so that she could generate a household income and have a means of working so that she can stay ahead.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the earnings generated by her grocery store, she is able to buy more merchandise that she is lacking and her customers are looking to buy.  She is also saving some money so that she can construct a building where she can sell more products.  Aurora says her house is very small, so she needs more space in order to provide better service to her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nAurora started this group by inviting two other members into the program.  The group is called \u201cIndependientes\u201d (Independent) because each of these women work without having to depend on their husbands.  The members of this group consist of three women involved in different business activities:\r\n<p>\r\n\u2022\tIddai S. Guzm\u00e1n will use her loan to buy pigs for fattening and resale in the local area.\r\n\u2022\tMargoth C. P. buys chickens and sells them dressed.\r\n\u2022\tAurora E. P. manages a store and is the woman who was interviewed.

She lives with her spouse and they have three schoolage children together. They live together in the community of Santa Rosa, where they have their own house made of wood. Despite not having finished primary school,  Katiuska was undaunted by the adversity in her path. She summoned the necessary strength to start her own business, specifically in agriculture.  Today she produces and sells considerable amounts of cacao to her biggest customers. This brings her good income, due to the timely delivery to each of her customers. Normally, she works with her spouse, but at harvest and planting time she hires farmhands so that it is easier to extract the cacao product and then sell it in the stockpiling centers of her community. Her plan for the future is to expand to other areas. For this she will look for new cropland in strategic areas with the purpose of minimizing time and cost.  This is her first loan with MFP. She is committed to making the payments according to schedule. She is also happy with her communal bank, since it has been very beneficial.

She lives in the locality of Santa Rosa (on the edge of the jungle), where she has her own home.  She recalls that a few years back, her spouse didn't have a job and they only had a small crop of cacao plants that in certain occasions could barely provide for her family.  Thanks to the unconditional support of her parents, they were able to overcome that difficult time.  Nowadays they cultivate and sell in large quantities to their buyers, who feel satisfied with the product that they are purchasing.  As a result, the sales produce good earnings.  In general, she receives constant help from her spouse and together they make a good team.  Sometimes she receives help from laborers to help facilitate the final production.  Normally she sells her product to the distribution centers in her area at a competitive price.  Her future plans are to acquire new land with the proposal of improving her quality of life and that of her family's.  This is her fourteenth credit with MFP.  As such, she promises to continue fulfilling her payment plan.  In addition, she is happy with her communal bank for providing good economic results.  With the credit that she is seeking, she plans to invest in the purchase of supplies and fertilizers in order to properly maintain her cacao plantations.     <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":581934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase fertilizer to be used on her cacao plantations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-11T13:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463082,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-12T19:01:14Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":221611,"name":"Se\u00f1or De Muruhuay Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"SE\u00d1OR D.

She lives in her own house together with her husband, Severo, aged 40, and their three beloved children. They are her strength and the reason for her efforts. Every day since very early in the morning Yanet tends to the fields very well knowing that her earnings depend on the quality of the harvest of potatoes and peas.  She takes the harvest to the markets to sell on a wholesale basis, in the city of Tarma. That is where she gets the best prices. What she most enjoys is sowing the seeds. She has been working in this occupation for the past 25 years. The hardest part of her work is having to transport the harvest. With time she hopes to purchase more land to increase production. This is her third credit with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). She indicates that this loan will be very helpful in improving their quality of life, one step at a time.

The loan she is requesting will be invested in cattle. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Fanning, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":582044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2010-08-11T18:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.51},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":175.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166844228,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172110406,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":175.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177403635,"comment":null},{"amount":62.51,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":175.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182542126,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188678896,"comment":null},{"amount":62.49,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":175.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191420362,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-12T16:16:03Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:18:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":221658,"name":"Maxima","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"M\u00e1xima es casada, tiene 2 hijos que estudian, M\u00e1xima es socia del Banco Comunal Futuro hace 10 a\u00f1os y lo que aprendi\u00f3 en este tiempo es ser puntual.\nM\u00e1xima tiene un puesto en el mercado 12 de abril en donde vende abarrotes en general, actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas desde las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 6 de la noche.\nM\u00e1xima necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1500 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de arroz, az\u00facar, fideo, aceite, jab\u00f3n.\nLos sue\u00f1os de M\u00e1xima son tener casa propia pues vive en casa alquilada.\n\n\n","en":"M\u00e1xima is married and has two children who are students.

Her prior loan allowed her to increase her income because she tells us that new capital to work results in profits for her.\n\nHer greatest challenge is her business\u2019 security and that is what she\u2019s working on to feel more relaxed because she's located just at the outskirts of town.\n\nShe will use these funds to buy stock items for her store during the month of love and friendship so that she can be prepared for the year\u2019s second semester, a very good time for commerce, when customers increase and there is better flow of money.  She will take advantage of this resource to also make some adjustments to her home to provide it with better security for the end of the year.\n\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael

18 a\u00f1os gracias a un funcionario del I.C.A.  (Instituto Colombiano agropecuario)  que llev\u00f3 este arte a Sabanalarga su pueblo, inici\u00f3 con 10 colmenas, con una inversi\u00f3n de $380.000, y gradualmente fue adquiriendo mas en las poblaciones de Sabanalarga, cascajal, Polonuevo, Caracol, Piojo, Galapa y Manat\u00ed, hasta completar  hoy 235,  de d\u00f3nde saca la pura miel, que \u00e9l mismo se encarga de empacar en su casa,  ubicada en el municipio de Malambo, en envases de 360 cent\u00edmetros c\u00fabicos y de 72 respectivamente y las  distribuye en  almacenes de productos naturistas, restaurante vegetarianos , distribuidores mayorista y al granel, a personas que quieren consumirla como parte de su r\u00e9gimen alimenticio .\n Juan Bautista  vende al por mayor mediante el sistema de  consignaci\u00f3n y le pagan a los 15 d\u00edas y al granel  le pagan de contado los frascos de 360 cent\u00edmetros c\u00fabicos los vende a $8.000 COP y los de 720 cent\u00edmetros c\u00fabicos  a    $ 16.000  COP.

Y es que \u00e9l parte de la premisa que si los humanos no molestamos sus abejas, ellas no atacan pero que de todas maneras \u00e9l siempre se protege para atender medidas de seguridad. Tambi\u00e9n plantea desde su experiencia como un buen observador y seguidor emp\u00edrico, que las fugas masivas de abejas en algunas partes del mundo obedecen a que ellas son  muy sensibles a los aparatos electr\u00f3nicos, celulares y medios modernos que  no lo resisten por su misma naturaleza.\nJuan Bautista y su esposa, que trabaja en el arte de confecciones mediante el sistema de maquilas,  con sus esfuerzos han apoyado su hogar y lo han  sacado adelante a sus 3 hijos ya profesionales. \u00c9l sue\u00f1a hoy con    perfeccionar su arte de cultivar abejas para extraer  su rica miel, haciendo el proceso lo m\u00e1s natural posible y convirti\u00e9ndolo en un ejemplo internacional.\n\n\n","en":"Juan Bautista Rodr\u00edguez is a man who knows a lot about bees and honey production.  The honey is very pure, and how could it not be, if he devotes himself to being a beekeeper.  He learned this trade when he was very young.  He would escape from school and go to the farms to learn about bee behavior and their hives.  This was how 18 years ago, thanks to an official from the I.C.A. (Colombian Agricultural Institute) who took this art to his town of Sabanalarga, he started with ten hives with an investment of $380.000. \r\n\r\nHe gradually was acquiring more hives in the towns of Sabanalarga, Cascajao, Polonuevo, Caracol, Piojo, Galapa, and Manat\u00ed.  He now has 235 from which he takes pure honey.  He sees to packing the honey himself.  He does this at his home, which is located in the Malambo municipality.  He packs the honey in containers that are 360 centimeters by 72 centimeters.  He delivers the packages of honey to stores that sell natural products, vegetarian restaurants, wholesale distributors, and in bulk to people who want to eat it as part of their nutritional regimen.\r\n\r\nJuan Bautista sells wholesale through a consignment system.  They pay him every 15 days, and he is paid cash for bulk sales.  He sells the bottles that are 360 cubic centimeters for $8.000 COP, and he sells the bottles that are 720 centimeters for $16.000 COP.\r\n\r\nHe is currently requesting his second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will buy 4.200 sheets of wax, comb foundation for the honeycomb, and 1.800 glass bottles to pack the pure honey and to prepare to start the harvest in November.  \r\n\r\nJuan Bautista still remembers how beekeepers would approach the bees without any protection by just blowing out mild smoke.  \u201cThis was,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen there were not African bees.\u201d  That was until some Chinese specialists came and introduced them without caring whether or not they were Columbian bees.  \r\n\r\nAside from the premise that if humans do not bother the bees they will not attack, he always protects himself in order to comply with security measures.  Also, from his experience of being a good observer and empirical follower, he states that the massive flight of bees in some parts of the world is due to the fact that they are very sensitive to electronic apparatus, cell phones, and modern media.  By nature they cannot resist them.\r\n\r\nJuan Bautista and his wife work in the art of making textiles in factories.  Through their efforts they have supported their household, and they have gotten their three children, who are now professionals, ahead.  \r\n\r\nHe now dreams of perfecting his art of cultivating bees in order to extract their delicious honey.  He makes the process as natural as possible, and he will turn it into an international example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

A. M. is 52 and married with 10 children who range in age from 2 to 26 years. She sells fabric handicrafts to tourists and local community members. Naite has four years of experience in this business.  \r\n\r\nNaite needs a loan of 2,900 Samoan talas to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts. She plans to use the earnings from her business, estimated to be 500 talas or about $208 per week, to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Naite joined SPBD. This is her fifth loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Naite's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

T. is 53 and married with six children (ages 10 - 35).

Tia needs a loan of WST $1,500 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tia joined SPBD.  This is her second loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She owns a business selling BBQ (sausages, chicken, and plantains).  Nightingale has two years of experience in this business.  Nightingale needs a loan of WST $2500 to buy BBQ meat, ketchup, plastic plates & utensils, and coal.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Nightingale joined SPBD. This is her fourth loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Nightingale's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

T. P. is 36 and married with five children (ages 1 - 14).  She owns a business planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Fuatino has three years of experience in this business.  Fuatino needs a loan of WST $1,700 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fuatino joined SPBD.  This is her third loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fuatino's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

S. is 62 and married with five children (ages 17 - 37).  She owns a business selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.  Falepau has three years of experience in this business.  Falepau needs a loan of WST $1,200 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Falepau joined SPBD. This is her second loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Falepau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

T. is 36 and married with five children (ages 1 - 16).  She owns a business planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Malama has two years of experience in this business.  Malama needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Malama joined SPBD.  This is her second loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Malama's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

F. is 48 and single with six children aged 2 to 6. She owns a business venture, selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or approximately US$130 per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fuapine joined SPBD and this is her first loan.

C. is from the village of Burgos, Naguillan.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Angelina has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Angelina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Angelina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future. Angelina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional baby livestock to raise & sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Angelina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

Kiva borrower is a 23-year-old single man living with his mother and 3 brothers. After the death of his father, he started working together with his brothers to satisfy the needs of the family. He started his business  in car painting in 2007. This young man works hard to earn income and improve his life situation. During those two years, his work operation has become bigger and he has gained a good number of clients. Today, he has the opportunity to develop and expand his business into other areas and attract more clients. To do so, he is requesting to borrow US$ 1000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase painting supplies at a good price.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free Kiva loans  to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

Kiva borrower is a 36 year old single man from Lebanon. He lives alone. He has 7 years of experience working with mobile phones. He began as an employee in a mobile shop and opened his own store in 2003. With his loan requested of US $1200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l., he will be able to increase his merchandise selection of new mobile phones and purchase prepaid telephone cards to sell. The majority of mobile phone users in Lebanon purchase these prepaid cards; it is less common to have an annual phone contract as is common in many Western countries. He reports that both his income and business productivity will be increased as a result of the loan. In the future, he is looking to further expand his business and increase his capital. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999.

Marlyn has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP when she sells her raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marlyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marlyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Marlyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She has been working as a beautician for the past 13 years from her home. She offers all the beauty services to her customers such as make-up, pedicure manicure, tattoo, etc. Her income is very important for her family and to support her husband who is working out of Lebanon to earn the needed income for his family. Today, she is requesting to borrow $1200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase a tattoo machine instead of renting one. In the future, she would like to open a formal beauty salon for women. She is working to achieve even greater business success in the coming year.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

Kiva borrower is a 47-year-old married man and father of three school-aged children. He is from Lebanon and has been working as an experienced car seller for the past eight years. His business consists of buying cars, making the needed maintenance, and reselling them to make a profit. He is thankful for his business income as it helps him to satisfy his heavy expenses and pay for his children's schooling. He offers his customers all types of car and also works on customer request. Today, he is requesting to borrow $1,200 from Kiva partner, Ameen s.a.l., to perform maintenance on some cars so that he can sell them as soon as possible and make a good profit from them. In the future, he hopes that he will be able to open a used car shop.\r\n<p>\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e. blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About Ameen<\/b><br>\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a microcredit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

His father is the main income provider but with this big family, the borrower helps his father to pay for the heavy expenses of life.  \r\n\r\nHe has four years of experience working as a home painter. He has been running his own business since 2008. He works independently in his business. Today, he is requesting a loan of $500 to purchase needed tools for his painting work. He estimates that the loan will help him increase his profits by 15%. \r\n\r\n<b>Note:<\/b> Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.).

Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

Kiva borrower is a 36-year-old married man from Lebanon. He is the father of three young children. He has owned a barber shop in his town since 1990. The borrower is well-known in his town and all the clients ask for his services and they feel comfortable with him. \r\n\r\nHe has taken a first loan from Ameen s.a.l. and has been very punctual with his repayments. Today, he is asking for his second loan of $300 to purchase merchandise such as shampoo, wax, gel, etc., to be always ready for his customers.\r\n\r\n<b>Note:<\/b> Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.). Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\n<b>About Ameen:<\/b>\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specializing in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l., we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

Kiva borrower is a 29-year-old single man from Lebanon. He lives with his parents and two brothers. He has been working as an experienced hairdresser for the past fifteen years. In addition to his shop operation, he also offers his beauty services upon request to the clients at their homes. He always tries to be up to date in this market and offers the new hair designs to his customers. Today, he is requesting to borrow $1,200 from the Kiva partner, Ameen s.a.l., to purchase new hairdressing tools for his work. In the future, he would like to expand his client base and he hopes to open a bigger beauty salon.  \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been withheld to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support of Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen: \r\n\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in Lebanese Micro-finance since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specializing in Micro-finance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement to their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

Most of them live in polygamous families in Maban, one of the villages of the prefecture of Dio\u00efla, Koulikoro region, 2nd administrative region of Mali. They collaborate with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution in order to better organize their activities at the beginning of the rainy season. The crops cultivated are, among others, pearl millet, peanuts, fonio ( a type of millet), beans and sesame. This is their sixth planting loan and all previous loans have been fully repaid. With this new loan, SATA D. plans to pay for planting supplies, small agricultural tools and ploughing costs to maintain approximately 1 hectare of pearl millet, peanuts and sesame. The crops are sold in the towns of Dio\u00efla and Massigui after the harvest to a clientele composed of men and women.

Temuco. These individuals\u2019 livelihoods consists of sales including artistic manufactured and handcrafted wood pieces, the installation and maintenance of stoves, heaters, etc., and the sale of Avon cosmetic catalogue items, perfumes, firewood and coal, handcrafted steel structure items, eggs, cheeses and deli-store items.\r\n\r\nWilliam is the president of the group and, in the above photo, he can be found in the second row, first on the right right, wearing a red and black sport-jacket and holding Fondo Esperanza brochures in his hand.\r\n\r\nWilliam\u2019s business consists of manufacturing cars (the structures of vehicles), and also masonry (construction, fences, sheds, etc.). He has two employees that he oversees and they assist him in this work. This has been his source of income and his profession for the past seven years; he took this as his calling after completing a program at a professional institute. He will use this loan to purchase a machine that can cut metal.\r\n\r\nWilliam\u2019s dream is to have a professional mechanic\u2019s shop, with all the machinery that he is still missing (which he notes is a lot). At this point he has a small space available by his house for his shop, and it\u2019s slowly being adapted. William would also like to provide employment for more people and continue perfecting his profession.\r\n\r\nWilliam is grateful to Fondo Esperanza as it\u2019s been the only place where he\u2019s been able to obtain a loan as he has no credit history. That is to say, he has never had a credit card, which other financial institutions look at as a bad indicator, such that they neglect providing loans to those who seek to improve their business.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of Araucan\u00eda Region. It is located 670 kilometers south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lakeside spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile's existing indigenous Mapuche community live, some of whom are members of Fondo Esperanza communal banks.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":581533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To

Her motivation is to ensure the education of her children, a 15-year-old son and an 8-year-old daughter. \r\n<p>\r\nPaola enjoys working with Fondo Esperanza, as she has established a good relationship with her loan officer and fellow borrowers. <p>\r\n\r\nVi\u00f1a del Mar is a city and community located in the central coastal region of Chile, known as the \"Garden City\" because of its beautiful parks and gardens.

It is hard work and he is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the confidence and support provided to him in authorizing the loan.         .    \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Machelle Wilson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":582561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a motorcycle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-08-12T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":233.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":233.34,"local_amount":233.34,"processed_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182532321,"comment":null},{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":233.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-25T09:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195830743,"comment":null},{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":233.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211213234,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-15T16:43:16Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:03:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":221937,"name":"Las Animadoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el grupo solidario Las Animadoras viven en la aldea Corinto, esta formado por tres mujeres trabajadoras que se dedican al comercio. a continuacion se detallan las diferentes actividades que ellas realizan:\n\nla se\u00f1ora Petrona V.

They still haven't had any contact with their parents and be able to give or offer them any help. In spite of all of this, the couple is made up of two very hardworking individuals. \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Juana C. showed up to the offices requsting a loan to be able to increase the small amount of

She lives in the centre core of the Cumbe region. This region is well known for its exuberant vegetation and its cold climate.  The population is mostly made up of cattle farmers and agriculturists. Much of the younger population has emigrated in search of better job opportunities. \r\n\r\nRosa Florinda is 47 years old, she is married and she has 3 children, aged 27, 24 and 12 years old. The eldest two daughters are single and are financially independent. Her youngest son starts school this year. Her husband works as a construction worker but because there isn't very much work he is also a cattle farmer. With their mutual hard work they were able to build their own house. \r\n\r\nRosa Florinda raises livestock, sells cattle, sheep and pigs.

At first only her relatives bought from her, and then her neighbors did.  Little by little she began to improve sales and over the months the business continued to develop, but the problem also arose of her income decreasing as she extended credit to a lot of people, which diminished her inventory.  \r\n\r\nDoris used her income to complete construction on her house.  She didn't have a water tank, which is essential for cooking and housecleaning.  She also partially supports the education of her three children, aged five, fourteen, and sixteen, who go to school.

Jovita has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Jovita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. Jovita is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in his business. This will be the tenth loan taken out by Jovita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Nelyn has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nelyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nelyn is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be the first loan taken out by Nelyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 34 years-old and married with three school-aged children. To make a living, Eva owns and operates a business providing recycling services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from hauling bottles for local businesses and community members. Eva has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Eva joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eva has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional recycled bottles to sell. Eva is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Eva from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

R. is from the village of Cabisera 5, Baribad. He is 37 years-old and married with three young children. To make a living, Tirso owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Tirso has been engaged in his business for over 16 years and earns approximately 50,000 PHP per harvest.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tirso joined Kiva partner ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Tirso is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Tirso from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to financially support immediate members of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":582312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fertilizers such as manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Cabisera 5, Baribad, Ilagan, Isabela","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2010-08-13T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tirso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:55:02Z","rounded_local_amount":15748.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188610861,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-08-15T16:14:46Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T11:55:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
