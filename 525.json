is a married woman who lives in Narra, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a fruit stand business.  \r\n\r\nHer husband Reynaldo, who is 54 years old, works as a farmer and also helps with his wife's business activities.  They have seven children who are between 13 to 28 years old.\r\n\r\nBebelyn joined Kiva partner NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bebelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, and lifted the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to buy a stock of fruits so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nBebelyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

F. is a married woman who lives in Yulo street, Brgy. 8, Isabela, Negros Occidental.

They have three children who are between 6 to 16 years old. \r\n\r\nElsa joined Kiva partner NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elsa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 27,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, lifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000, which she intends to use to buy piglets, chickens and a goat to raise so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business and education of her children.\r\n\r\nElsa F. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Sta. Lucia, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 41 years old. Shirly is the group leader of a 8-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nShirly is separated from spouse and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Shirly owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling ice cream to the local community. Shirly has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Shirly joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Shirly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Shirly is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Shirly from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

T. and her granddaughter are pictured in the photograph. Sorn T. is a widow who operates a farming business. Sorn T. was married, but her husband died several years ago. She has three children: one is married and lives away from home, and the other two are single. Sorn T. depends on one son who works as a horse cart driver. He always uses his horse cart as the main vehicle for picking up both his customers and the many items for earning his daily income. Recently, Sorn T.\u2019s son has been facing difficulties transporting his customers, because his horse cart is slow and that affects how he can satisfy the needs of his customers. Sorn T. really wants to help her son but she doesn\u2019t have sufficient money to make it possible.

She is from the village of Aggub, a part of the municipality of Solano, Nueva Vizcaya province on the Luzon islands. Tessie is the group leader of a thirteen-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nTessie makes and sells barbecue pork and chicken. She has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tessie joined ASKI to gain access to its financial services. She successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase the raw ingredients needed to make her barbecue pork and chicken. Tessie is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP that will be used for the same purpose. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nAlalay sa Kaunlaran, Inc., or ASKI, is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and -women, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that one-on-one translations of entrepreneur profiles are costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow it to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":678704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy additional ingredients for her barbecue chicken and pork","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.

Her most recent loan of 29,500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Vienna aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is 32 years old. Gemalyn is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\n\nGemalyn is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Gemalyn owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Gemalyn has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Gemalyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

is a married woman who lives in Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Marcelo, who is 39 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have five children who are between 2 and 18 years old. Evangeline joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Evangeline has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 5,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 7,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her third loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for more stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nFrancisca is married and has 9 school-aged children. To make a living, Francisca owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a direct selling business. The main source of income for the business comes from selling cosmetic products such as talc powder, lotions and make-up kits in the local community. Francisca has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Francisca joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Francisca has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. Francisca is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Francisca from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":685537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

B. is 38 years old and lives with his wife and two children in Harhorin, the ancient capital city of the Mongolian empire, in Uvurkhangai province in Mongolia. His eldest daughter, age 13, attends a local secondary school. He and his family live together in a house and fence. With the help of his wife, Enhtur operates a successful tourist camp business in his town. He opened his tourist camp in 1999, operating with only two gers (a traditional Mongolian nomadic dwelling) on his father's plot of land. After years of operation, his business has proven very profitable. Therefore, he was able to buy more land and erect more gers next to Erdenezuu, which is an ancient Buddhist temple. Additionally, he has also built a winter house that is connected with a hot and cold water system. \r\n\r\nEnhtur now has contracts with tourist companies in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Those companies send foreigners and tourists to his camp. His earnings have enabled him to buy a car and greatly improve his family's standard of living. For the future, he plans to expand his business by building a restaurant in his camp. \r\n\r\nEnhtur also works for the local history museum to supplement his earnings.

is a 43-year old married woman who supports her family by operating a general store. She lives in Medellin, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 8,400 PHP. \r\n\r\nGenelita is borrowing 10,000 PHP so she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her third loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 4,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Genelita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She says that this business is profitable and the only major challenge she has is transportation, since timber is bulky and heavy. \r\n\r\nShe works very hard to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of 50,000 KES to buy more timber to meet the demands of her customers. In the future, she hopes to expand her business and purchase land to build a residential house. She describes herself as honest and industrious."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":618.4,"image":{"id":685612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","use":"To buy more timber for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.283333 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":138,"posted_date":"2011-01-05T12:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.6,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.79,"local_amount":2943,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2972.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191488790,"comment":null},{"amount":49.05,"local_amount":3924,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:04:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3963.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195916933,"comment":null},{"amount":49.05,"local_amount":3924,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3963.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201488849,"comment":null},{"amount":61.31,"local_amount":4905,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:47:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4954.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206225341,"comment":null},{"amount":98.1,"local_amount":7848,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-25T08:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7926.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217713034,"comment":null},{"amount":55.02,"local_amount":4401.63,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4445.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221893909,"comment":null},{"amount":55.34,"local_amount":4427.37,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4471.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227253829,"comment":null},{"amount":213.74,"local_amount":17627,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":17803.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":6.6,"payment_id":232880997,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-05T15:49:26Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T10:12:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":263134,"name":"Tanatar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tanatar K. is 44 years old and lives with his wife and four children in the Bayan-Ulgii province of Mongolia.

H. is a 31-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a pig fattening business. She lives in Medellin, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her pig fattening business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4200. \r\n\r\nGerlie is  borrowing PHP 10000 so that she can purchase feed and medicines for her pigs. This will be her third loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 4000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nGerlie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two businesses: one a passenger transport (by motorized tricycle) and the other a general store. Her husband Felixardo, who is 32 years old, drives the tricycle to earn his living. They have four children who are 1 to 7 years old. \r\n\r\nMarilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly income of 8,400 PHP, bettering the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her third loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use as down payment for another motorcycle so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of business and the education of her children. \r\n\r\nMarilyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

In the photo above, she is standing in the center of her fellow group members.\r\n\r\nShe's been in this business for 2 years.  Besides selling cement for blocks, she also sells tea products, juice, body lotion, and other cosmetics. She also earns income  from the  government\u2019s children grant. She says that the main challenges to her business are lack of water and a shortage of customers because of competition.\r\n\r\nShe requested this loan through Woman\u2019s Development Business (WDB) to buy cement, sand for blocks, and cosmetics products. She says that the extra income from this loan will help her to continue in building her house, pay for educational fees and help her first-born go to a technical school. In the future, she would like to see her business expand, increasing her employees from 4 to 10, and adding a workshop to produce blocks in order to sell in different places.\r\n\r\nComments: She

M. lives in Col. Centro, Axochiapan, in the State of Morelos, in Mexico.  She is 39 years old and completed her basic education.  She will use her loan to expand her business selling sewing supplies, gifts and cuddly toys.  She will use her loan to buy cuddly toys, gift bags, sewing supplies and toys for 'Reyes Magos' (a holiday which is celebrated in Mexico on January 6th, when children receive gifts from 'The Three Kings').  Ruth learned the trade from her dad who had an identical business in Axochiapan town square where he sold gifts.  Since she was small, Ruth used to accompany her dad to buy the merchandise to stock his business and so she knew where to buy products for her business.\r\n\r\nRuth started her business 15 years ago with her husband.  It was an inheritance from her dad.  When she was single she would look after her dad's business and then she started, little by little, selling on a small table outside her home.  When she decided to invest with loans, her business grew and she was able to buy more merchandise with which to stock her business.  It grew gradually.  Now Ruth has her business located in her home.  She feels proud to have her own business and she also tells us that it helps her to cover her household expenses.  She feels happy because, in spite of the fact that there are seasons when her sales are low, her business always makes good profits.\r\n\r\nSome of the challenges that Ruth faces are rising prices and competition.  She tells us that in the fifteen years she has been selling, another four similar businesses have set up in her street.  For this reason, she plans to expand her business through loans from KIVA and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  She is thinking of requesting a larger loan so that she can buy more merchandise and have a competitive business.\r\n\r\nRuth is married.  Her husband works from home fixing televisions, modulars, DVD players, etc.  She has two children.  6 year-old Jos\u00e9 Manuel is in elementary school and 14 year-old Yoselin is in high school.  Her husband and her daughter help her in her business, serving customers at different times of day.  She considers that her business has helped her a lot in getting her family ahead in life and making improvements to her home.  She has a number of plans for the future, including expanding her business and putting up a curtain so that her merchandise looks nicer.  She wants to continue enjoying good health and to continue making good sales.  The improvement that she would like to make in her children's futures is for them to want to study.  Other improvements that she would like to make include plastering and painting her house.\r\n\r\nRuth feels very happy with the loan that she received since it has enabled her to grow her business and increase her sales.  She would like to say to Kiva and to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Thank you for the opportunity.  Above all, thank you for the trust that you place in us since you don't know us and yet you still lend us money.  Thanks to this, we are able to grow our businesses\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":685845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Compra de munecos de peluche, bolsas para regalo, merceria y juguetes ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"AXOCHIAPAN MOR.","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-05T18:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":160.03,"local_amount":1882.66,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1961.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430818,"comment":null},{"amount":106.3,"local_amount":1250.57,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1302.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850071,"comment":null},{"amount":106.3,"local_amount":1250.56,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1302.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292345,"comment":null},{"amount":52.37,"local_amount":616.21,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":641.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160603,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-08T04:17:00Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":263209,"name":"Sincerity Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Members of the \u201cSincerity Group\u201d are pictured here.

At present, its economy depends on the duty-free industrial zones, the cement industry, and minor activities such as tourism. \r\n\r\nWendy is engaged in clothing sales. She requested her first Esperanza loan almost two years ago, shortly after starting her business, and she is now receiving her third loan.

She is going to use her profits to further invest in the business and plans to focus her attention on improving the business in order to continue to raise her family's standard of living.

Every morning this hard-working woman hurries off to the market in an adjacent neighborhood to buy meat, vegetables and condiments.  After she has done her shopping, she starts preparing her meals for the day.  She has been working for 27 years in her popular neighborhood eatery which is located two blocks from her home.  Here she provides her services with other ladies from her neighborhood.  As payment for her work, she receives five plates of food a day with which she feeds her family.  Her husband works from home as a carpenter , making household accessories, and Dina helps him in the afternoons, sanding wood.  She keeps busy with this work.  In the future, Dina plans to acquire an electric sander since she feels that this would make her work quicker.\r\n\r\nThis is Dina's 34th loan with MFP and she has, once again, pledged to be responsible in making her repayments.

Aiymbubu was born into a low-income family and from early childhood, she had to help her parents around the house and earn money at the local diary factory. Aiymbubu got married at the age of 20. Soon she gave a birth to three daughters and one son. Unfortunately, her family life was not happy and she was divorced from her husband in 1997. As Aiymbubu became the only breadwinner for her children, she decided to start animal breeding. Using an initial amount of 15,000 Kyrgyz soms, she bought one milk cow, whose milk she sold to the dairy factory. Later on, her livestock grew and in order to reduce her expenses for the livestock's foraging, she pastured her livestock in the mountainous areas with native grasses. Now, Aiymbubu has two milk cows, two horses and 15 sheep at her farm. On the weekends, Aiymbubu and her son sells meat at the local market. \r\n\r\nAs Aiymbubu is a very hardworking person, she is also engaged in sewing mattresses, cushions and coverings, which became very popular in her local area because of the low prices and good quality of her products. Now, Aiymbubu requests a loan of 50,000 Kyrgyz soms to buy two bull calves for fattening and reselling.  It allows her further development of her household and business. In the future, she plans to hold her daughters\u2019 weddings and give good dowries for them.

To make a living, Maryrose owns & operates a business operating motorcycle transport services. Maryrose has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maryrose joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maryrose has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase tires and other accessories. Maryrose is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to repair an existing vehicle for better service. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Maryrose from ASKI.

is 32 years old and is married with four children between the ages of 4 and 11 years old and three adoptees.  Her husband is a nurse, and they both work hard to provide all of the basic needs of their family.

She lives with her husband and their two children in their own house.  The children are still in school.  \r\n\r\nShe makes stuffed potatoes (with ground meat), and she sells them at the door of a very popular school in her district.  Her business is seven blocks from her house.  She parboils the potatoes and then uniformly flattens them.  After that, she rolls it up with seasoning and the meat inside.  Her last step is to fry them in hot oil.\r\n\r\nShe then loads the potatoes on her large platter and sets herself up at the door of the school.  That is where the students buy her stuffed potatoes from her.  This is the way that Rosa works alone in her business, and it is going very well for her.  With her good service, all of the students value her.  What she likes the best about her work is talking with the students\u2019 mothers.  She watches out for their children, and she is very happy with her work.\r\n\r\nShe has been cooking her potatoes for over 15 years.  She is more than satisfied with the profitability of the business.  Later, she plans to set up a grocery store in her house in order to expand her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her eleventh loan with MFP, and she pledges to make her payments punctually.

Hern\u00e1ndez, un se\u00f1or de poco mas de 65 a\u00f1os, el punto de reuni\u00f3n del grupo esta ubicado a unos pasos del conocido lugar llamado el pozo de de san jacinto, este es un lugar publico donde la gente acude a lavar ropa y es de uso para toda la poblaci\u00f3n de Jamiltepec. Esta agrupaci\u00f3n esta conformada por 11 personas, quienes son originarios y vecinos de esta localidad, todos ellos e conocen entre si y comparten las mismas tradiciones y costumbres, algunos son ind\u00edgenas y otros no, pero eso no es motivo por el cual no puedan estar unidos.\nEn esta narraci\u00f3n hablaremos de la se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda A. O., de 28 a\u00f1os de edad, ella es artesana de toda la vida, nos comenta que la elaboraci\u00f3n de huipiles lo practica desde hace mas de 10 a\u00f1os, cuando su cu\u00f1ada la ense\u00f1o a elaborar tan bonitas prendas antes de fallecer, ella nos cometa que es la mejor herencia que pudo haber recibido, ya que por medio de esta actividad puede obtener recursos para apoyar a sus dos peque\u00f1os hijos que son, Flor de 12 a\u00f1os y Jes\u00fas de 11 a\u00f1os de edad, ellos est\u00e1n estudiando actualmente, flor cursa la educaci\u00f3n secundaria y Jes\u00fas el sexto a\u00f1o de la primaria, el esposo de Mar\u00eda es campesino de nombre Javier quien tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad. \nEl bordado de huipiles es una actividad muy conocida y practicada  en la regi\u00f3n de la costa chica de Oaxaca principalmente donde existen poblaciones de ind\u00edgenas mixtecos, las prendas como los huipiles, las naguas, los telares, y otros han distinguido siempre a las comunidades de ind\u00edgenas, cada regi\u00f3n tiene sus propias caracter\u00edsticas y colores apropiados en estas prendas, ya que cada una de ellas representa el grupo, la clase y la distinci\u00f3n del pueblo de la persona quien porta esta preciada vestimenta, Mar\u00eda  elabora bordados y acabados de huipiles, hilados a mano, para esto se utilizan materiales propios de la regi\u00f3n, que se distinguen desde su origen hasta el detallado de las prendas.\nEl motivo por el cual Mar\u00eda solicito un cr\u00e9dito fue para la compra de materiales que utiliza en la elaboraci\u00f3n y bordados de huipiles, ella con este dinero pudo comprar listones en colores amarillo, azul rey, rojo, naranja y caf\u00e9, estos listones en diferentes presentaciones y tama\u00f1os, tambi\u00e9n compro hilo de algod\u00f3n para bordado, hilo de seda, madeja de algod\u00f3n para bordar en diferentes colores, telar de cintura hilado a mano, telar te\u00f1ido con caracol p\u00farpura, aro para bordar y algunas agujas.  \nLo que le gusta a Mar\u00eda es la combinaci\u00f3n de colores, es por eso que ella disfruta la creaci\u00f3n de sus trabajos, al principio dice que cuando viv\u00eda su cu\u00f1ada ella era que le combinaba los colores, pero  despu\u00e9s ella tuvo que hacerlo, nos comparte que en algunas ocasiones no le pagan lo justo por su trabajo, pero eso no la desanima, ella le echa mas ganas y sigue adelante, para elaborar un huipil Mar\u00eda se tarda aproximadamente una semana dedic\u00e1ndole todo un d\u00eda completo. Su oficio le ha permitido a poyar a su esposo con el gasto escolar de sus hijos, ha podido darle continuidad a su actividad y no le ha faltado lo necesario para seguir trabajando.\nSer artesana no es cosa f\u00e1cil primero porque tienen que entender que es lo que hacen, de donde viene, y que simboliza para la persona quien esta creando este arte.\nMar\u00eda desea mejorar su calidad de vida y  la de sus hijos, no pretende ganar mucho dinero solamente lo necesario para llevar una vida digna y perdurable, ella quisiera que estas prendas no se pierdan nunca y prevalezcan durante todo el tiempo, sin perder su significado y sin sufrir modificaci\u00f3n alguna.\nLa esperanza de Mar\u00eda es ver a sus hijos crecer en un ambiento propio de si mismos, sin carencias ni limitaciones, ella desea ver a sus ni\u00f1os terminar bien una preparaci\u00f3n escolar, para que el d\u00eda de ma\u00f1ana ellos puedan aspirar a algo mejor de lo que ella y su esposo no tuvieron, ya que el ser campesino es como estar destinado a vivir en la pobreza y en la carencia de una vida c\u00f3moda, ella quiere que sus ventas no decaigan, que su producci\u00f3n crezca y que su hija aprenda tambi\u00e9n este oficio como una herramienta mas de supervivencia.\n A nombre de sus compa\u00f1eros y compa\u00f1eras que integran este grupo Mar\u00eda le da las gracias a los que hacen posible este apoyo humano, de no ser por los que participan en esta labor los que est\u00e1n en la misma situaci\u00f3n de Mar\u00eda no tendr\u00edan respaldo alguno, a todo este gran equipo ella les manda un abrazo y no hay mejor agradecimiento que una sonrisa de parte de ella.\n\u201cArc\u00e1ngel Misael\u201d.

Hern\u00e1ndez is the group\u2019s leader and their meeting place is only a few steps from the place known as the Well of San Jacinto.  This is a public place, available for the entire population of Jamiltepec, where the people gather to wash clothes.  This group is made up of 11 people, originally from this area.  They are all neighbors and all know one another and share the same traditions and customs.  Some are aboriginal and others not, but that is not a reason for them not to be united. \r\n\r\nHere we will talk about 28 year old Mar\u00eda A. O..  She\u2019s been an artist her entire life and tells us that she\u2019s been making \u201chuipiles\u201d (Mayan style dresses) for more than 10 years.  Her mother in law taught her to make these beautiful clothing items, before she passed away, and [Mar\u00eda] believes that this was the greatest inheritance that she could have received, because it allows her to generate the income she needs to support her two young children; 12 year old Flor and 11 year old Jes\u00fas.  Both are in school.  Flor is in junior high school and Jes\u00fas is in sixth grade.  Her husband, 43 year old Javier, is a field worker. \r\n\r\nHuipil embroidering is well known and practiced in the La Costa Chica region of Oaxaca, particularly in areas inhabited by aboriginal people.  Clothing items such as huipiles, naguas, telares, and other types of traditional clothing, have always distinguished the aboriginal communities from one another, and each region has its own style and colors of clothing, representative of each group.  Mar\u00eda embroiders and finishes huipiles by hand, using materials from the region that distinguish the details in the clothing.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda requested this loan to buy supplies that she uses for making and embroidering huipiles, such as yellow, royal blue, red, orange, and brown ribbons of different types and size.  She also bought different types of cotton and silk thread in different colors, handmade belts, purple dyed fabric, crochet hoops and some needles.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda likes to combine colors.  This is why she enjoys her work.  When her mother in law was living, she used to combine colors for her, but then [Mar\u00eda] had to learn to do it herself.  She tells us that there are times when she is not paid fairly for her labor, but that does not discourage her.  She puts forth more effort and forges ahead.  It takes her about a week, working all day, every day, to make each huipil.  Her craft allows her to help her husband pay for their children\u2019s schooling and she has not been short of what she needs to continue her work.  This is not an easy task because one must understand where they come from, where they live, and what the craft means to its artist.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda wants to improve her children\u2019s quality of life.  She does not pretend to make much money; just enough to afford a dignified and lasting life.  She hopes that these clothing styles are never lost and that they continue without modifications. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda\u2019s hopes are to see her children grow up in their own environment, without limits or cares.  She also wants to see them get a good education so that they can aspire for something better than what she and her husband had, because being a field hand destines one to live a life of poverty with a desire for a comfortable life.  She wants her sales not to decrease and to increase her production.  She also wants her daughter to learn this art as a tool for greater achievement.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is thankful, and in the name of her fellow members, appreciates those whom make this human support possible.  If it was not for those who participate in this effort, those who are in the same situation as Mar\u00eda would have no one to lean on.  She sends a hug to the whole team and there is no better way to say thank you than a smile from her.\r\n\r\n\u201cArc\u00e1ngel Misael\u201d is made up of a number of responsable, hard working people with great dedication to their fellow members.

When these have reached a good level of development, she offers them for sale to area merchants and the general public. \r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, she and her husband work in planting products such as corn on a small agricultural tract located in the vicinity of their dwelling.  Nancy and her family depend on these activities in order to progress economically.\r\n<p>\r\nNancy wants to acquire balanced feed in order to improve the development of her animals.  She also wants to make some repairs to their pens and obtain fertilizers for her crop.  To achieve her objectives she has seen the necessity of applying to Epydme Alternativa for a loan of 2000 new soles.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":686860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To acquire balanced feed in order to improve the development of her animals, repair their pens, and purchase fertilizers for her crop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chepito - Morrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-01-07T00:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":137.61},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":142.2},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":152.54},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":152.04},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":155.57},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":165.02},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":168.98},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":172.43},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":180},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":185.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":191.39},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":196.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.3},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.11},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.51},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.35},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":137.61,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":139.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191410613,"comment":null},{"amount":51.55,"local_amount":142.2,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":144.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196109024,"comment":null},{"amount":55.3,"local_amount":152.54,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":154.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201271188,"comment":null},{"amount":55.11,"local_amount":152.04,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":154.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206137761,"comment":null},{"amount":56.4,"local_amount":155.57,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:00:21Z","rounded_local_amount":158.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211210292,"comment":null},{"amount":59.82,"local_amount":165.02,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:54:11Z","rounded_local_amount":167.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216488586,"comment":null},{"amount":396.94,"local_amount":1095.02,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1112.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222204823,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-07T06:17:58Z","paid_date":"2011-08-19T07:42:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":263517,"name":"Mainifo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mainifo T. is a 41-year-old woman living in the town of Saasaai.

Her experience and commitment have allowed her to break into the business of selling fruit and, once a week, she travels to another town to deliver not only her own harvests but also the produce of other farmers from her town.  Norly tells us that she sells Seda and Isla bananas.  They are so good that on every journey she makes a net average profit of 150 to 200 Peruvian soles.  However, as a good businesswoman, Norly would like to invest in setting up a grocery store where she can offer staple food products since the area where she lives lacks a grocery store and the residents have to travel to the city to buy food.\r\n\r\nNorly is a member of the \"Las Palmas\" community bank.  This is her seventh loan from MFP and she shares new experiences in the constant meetings that she has with the members of her working group.
