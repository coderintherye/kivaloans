She will use her loan to buy clay tureens, pots and jugs.  The other members continue with their pottery business.  \r\n\r\nPaula is 40 years old, married and has a 15-year-old son going to high school.  She sells clay pots, tureens and jugs.  She requested the loan to improve her business.  She will buy pots, tureens and jugs of different sizes and styles to have available for her customers.  She started her business twenty years ago; her parents taught her how to work in pottery.  Most of the town is involved in pottery.  She started out with just a little and gradually grew with her work and with help from her husband and son.  She goes out to sell at the markets and street fairs and she\u2019s proud of the work she does.  Her business has grown.\r\n\r\nHer pottery sells well because her products look pretty.  She uses profits to cover household expenses and for her son\u2019s school.  She\u2019s planning to expand the business buying more products of various styles and sizes and she plans to accomplish this with the loans.

She is married and has three children in preschool and elementary.  Since Lety is well known in her town she is requesting a loan to invest in her fruit and vegetable business to sell seasonal fruit such as avocado, nostle fruit, potatoes, spinach, guava, oranges, etc.  She has been in business for approximately three years.  She starts her day at 4:00 a.m. when she goes to the produce market in a nearby town.  There she buys fresh fruit at a good price.  One of the difficulties she has is when sales are slow and the produce goes bad.  Lety says the loan will be beneficial because she will be able to stock fruit and with the earnings contribute more to the household expenses which will improve her children's lifestyle.  One of Leticia's goals is to have her own stall at the market, since now she is a street vendor.

Tambi\u00e9n cuando los alumnos entran a la escuela las ventas bajan ya que los padres tienen que cubrir los gastos de la escuela y se quedan sin dinero.

Together they have 2 children. Juan Angel is 15 years old and no longer studies and Rodolfo is 13 years old and also doesn't study.\r\n\r\nShe sells shawls at the open air markets. This time she is asking for a loan to invest in her business as she barely has any merchandise left. She thinks that she has enough to buy 50 shawls more or less. She buys them ready-made as they are machine-made. She tells us that there are others that are handcrafted but these are more expensive. Also hardly anybody wants to buy the handcrafted ones. It makes her sad that people no longer value what Mexican hands can produce as now everything comes from China , machine-made. \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Josefina sells her shawls everyday walking the street markets and has 20 years experience doing this. The challenge she faces is that the street vendors chase her away as they don't want to let her sell in the market. Also when the children go back to school sales go down as their parents have to cover school expeenses and are out of pocket. However, despite this Do\u00f1a Josefina has goals which are to improve her house and that one day she can get into another business. \r\n\r\nShe leaves us with this message: \"Thank you to the people who lend us money and who are concerned about low income Mexican families; it helps us a lot.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":885306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy shawls.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-10-07T06:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1752.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618953,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1752.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573198,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1752.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784910,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1752.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193478,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-10-15T10:18:50Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":343157,"name":"Paula","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"PAULA\nLa se\u00f1ora Paula tiene 50 a\u00f1os de edad est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Agust\u00edn desde hace 40 a\u00f1os.

For the future of their children, she works together with her husband. He plants cocoa, corn and citrus on his farming land. She says that they only own 2 but in the future wants to acquire more. \"That is my goal,\" she tells us. In her free time she helps her husband especially at harvest time as it is then that the results of so much work is obtained, selling to the buyers who come to their very land to make considerable profits. However, as the harvest is only once a year, she works at the weekends selling burgers and fries in a stall outside her house. According to her she makes a net gain of 30 soles (PEN) a day. Likewise her husband works as a labourer at different farms and with different crops. In this way they can cover their expenses for education, food and clothing for the year. She now wants to save in order to realize her project and so have a larger harvest. She belongs to the communal bank \"Los Naranjales\" and this is the 3rd loan with MFP where she learned everything she needed to know about how to save and get ahead. This is why she promises to be punctual with her repayments. Amalia is thinking of planting more corn on her farming land.

In addition to being very smart, Benilda makes the most of her time as she also raises hens which she fattens and then sells at a higher price.  She has nine years experience and what she most enjoys about her work is her independence as she has freedom with her money and the freedom to make her own decisions in order to improve her business.  The difficulty she faces is a lack of support.  For this reason, she constantly has to hire laborers to help her maintain and develop her crops.  Her goal is to achieve financial stability so that she can provide her children with a good education.\r\n\r\nBenilda is a member of the 'Los Amigos Cafetaleros' community bank and this is her first loan from MFP.  She is grateful for the opportunity that she is being given.  For her part, she pledges to make her loan repayments on time.  Benilda is planning to grow bananas and corn on her land.  With your support, she will invest the money she has requested in paying laborers to help her 'posear' (make smalls holes in the ground in order to plant seeds and grafted plants)."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":888406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

She has been running this kind of business for two years. She is 57 years of age and has been blessed with five children. \r\n\r\nFelicidad would like to maintain her general store in order to provide the needs of her family. She works very hard to sustain their daily needs. According to her, sometimes or most of the times she suffers from difficulties in managing her store due to some neighborhoods' bad credit. \r\n\r\nThis challenge is the reason why she is in need of additional capital in the amount of P15,000.

He started selling second hand clothing 17 years ago, after university. He is completing his third loan cycle with HOPE and has so far repaid his loans successfully and managed to build up considerable savings.

Mirvat wants to help her son to purchase a new rickshaw to drive and increase the family income, but she doesn't have enough money to share with her son, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. \r\n\r\nWhen Mirvat gets the loan, which will be repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to help her son to purchase a new rickshaw so he will work extra hours to improve the family income and provide better living conditions to the family. \r\n\r\nMirvat is a conservative woman, so her son Ahmad is photographed instead next to the rickshaw he will buy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product: FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He is married and has one son. He has a taxi and works as a taxi driver with a low income, and it is the only source of income for the family. Jamal wants to improve the taxi conditions by purchasing a new engine so the taxi's work capacity will increase. The amount of money he has isn't enough to pay for a new engine, so he needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Jamal gets the loan, which will be repaid on a monthly basis, he will purchase a new engine for his taxi. This will increase the capacity for the taxi to work and enable Jamal to work extra hours to increase his income and provide better living conditions to his family. Jamal is photographed next to his taxi.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product: FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself.

They are her reason for living and they live together in the town of Uni\u00f3n Autiki. It was very hard for her to achieve financial security.  She shares that she managed to get two agricultural plots with a lot of hard work and effort.  There she works hard farming coffee and plantains, because she knows she is dependent upon the harvest for her earnings.  She has 8 years of experience farming and her favorite part of the job is selling her products in the city of Pichanaki, as it provides concrete evidence of her labors. She also takes advantage of her trips to the city to buy food and clothing for her daughters.  Her goal is to start her own business and in that way, earn a little extra money.  She has already taken the first step by starting her own sweets shop, where she is having a lot of success.  However, she lacks the capital for her business.  This is why she began to work with this group of women in the loan group.  She is certain that she will be able to make her little store one that is well-stocked and offer more products.

She lives with Sergio, 48, and their three children in their own house located in Samugari District.  Delfina works farming the land; she grows cocoa beans, beans and bananas. She has a total of three hectares of land and she\u2019s well aware of the hard work farming entails.  She\u2019s been working her own fields for 20 years.  During harvest time she gets help from day workers who harvest and transport the harvested products a certain distance to then be transported by small vehicles.  She feels very committed to her work because thanks to her daily effort she enjoys seeing that her plants bear good results today producing good profits.  She comments that the winter is not of her liking because that\u2019s when insects that damage her crops abound.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested loan to buy grafted cocoa bean and coffee plants to obtain fruit in shorter time.  This will be Delfina\u2019s first loan and she feels very cheerful knowing she\u2019ll get support from lenders and because of this she commits to make the programmed payments on punctually.   She will use the requested 1000 new soles to buy grafted cocoa bean and coffee plants to earn better income in a shorter period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":889117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy grafted cocoa bean and coffee plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-08T20:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delfina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-10-12T13:10:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":343604,"name":"Amigas Solidarias De Miguel Grau Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u201cAmigas Solidarias de Miguel Grau\u201d es una alcanc\u00eda comunal integrada por 8 personas responsables y emprendedoras las cuales trabajan bien con el programa.
