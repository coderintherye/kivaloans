They all run their own businesses. The majority sells cosmetics, but others sell fast food. Other members, like the president, provide in-home hair styling services, while others sell flowers. Competition is stiffer these days because of the situation that the country is in, which is why the group members have to work harder to bring home the daily bread. The loan will be used to obtain a greater variety of products and to increase their work tools so that the group members can do their job more efficiently. Their hope for the future is to improve their businesses and provide a better quality of life for themselves and their families. Some of the members have experience with these types of loans, while others are learning to work in solidarity groups for the first time. However, they are all very enthusiastic about working together to get ahead in life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":424685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulo Gabriel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pura Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jimena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeanette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grecia Romane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Randy Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shirledy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":13000,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1560.68},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1578.64},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1596.8},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1615.18},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1633.76},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1652.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1671.58},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1690.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.1},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":227.69},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.3},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.96},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":235.64},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.35},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.09},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":683.09,"local_amount":4736.12,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4795.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678823,"comment":null},{"amount":232.96,"local_amount":1615.18,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:09:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1635.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678824,"comment":null},{"amount":235.64,"local_amount":1633.76,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1654.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678825,"comment":null},{"amount":238.35,"local_amount":1652.56,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1673.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073308,"comment":null},{"amount":241.09,"local_amount":1671.58,"processed_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073309,"comment":null},{"amount":243.87,"local_amount":1690.8,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1711.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909188,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-12-15T13:58:12Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":151807,"name":"Manoweil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manoweil is a 43 year-old man who lives in Tripoli, north Lebanon with his wife and their four children.

C. is 47 years old and the mother of two sons and a daughter.  She lives in the small rural Costa Rican community of La Esperanza, which is located in San Jos\u00e9 de Upala, Alajuela Province.  The main business development activities in the area are cattle breeding (for both beef and milk) and agriculture.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Lidia is a farmer, specifically growing bananas within the past year.  Even though she produces small quantities, she says the market for her product is very good.  As a result of her work, Lidia\u2019s living conditions have improved considerably.  She also says she has grown as a person and has acquired much knowledge.  Lidia feels very capable and is happy to remain active. \r\n<p>\r\nAt the moment, Do\u00f1a Lidia hopes to expand her farm so she is requesting a microloan of 250,000 colones.  In order to maintain her latest crop of bananas, she will purchase fertilizers and other supplies.  Lidia expects a good harvest from this investment.  This crop usually commands a high selling price, so she wants to increase her production so that she can generate more income for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Lidia is a member of the Women\u2019s Community Credit Enterprise of La Esperanza, which is composed solely of women.

This is Lidia\u2019s second loan and she hopes to continue growing personally and financially.  She is also an active participant of her local credit organization.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Common activities in this area are trade, livestock farming for both meat and dairy, and agriculture. <p>\r\nMar\u00eda has been a livestock farmer for meat and dairy for the last twenty years. She says that she makes the most of the calves by selling them but that, for the most part, she focuses on producing milk, cheese, and other dairy products. She sells these both in her own community and in neighboring towns, and in her opinion she has a good market both for selling to middlemen and directly to the public. <p>\r\nMar\u00eda thinks that, thanks to the success of this business, her living conditions have improved considerably, and she also comments that since starting her business her self esteem has improved and now she feels very capable. She says that she has grown a lot both personally and professionally.\r\nWhat Mar\u00eda wants now is a microloan of $550 to buy three more steers so that she can increase her production and ensure that her business grows and moves forward. <p>\r\nMar\u00eda is a member of the microcredit organization Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal de Mujeres la Esperanza which is available only for women and which specializes in supporting non-professional women and women who are heads of their households. This is one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.

She was born on March 02, 1982 and finished secondary education. Due to financial difficulties she did not pursue her college education. She looked for a job and helped her parents to earn a living.\r\n\r\nAfter two years, Sherill Jane married Darwin A. and they are blessed with two children. Being parents, they want their children to have a bright future by giving them the best education they can. Despite the economic crisis, they are doing all their best to earn a living for their survival and to finance the schooling of their children.\r\n\r\nAs a way of gaining income, Sherill\u2019s husband works in construction while Sherill is engaged in selling frozen foods in their village. She borrowed additional capital from one of the microfinance organizations which she used to acquire the frozen foods at Solano public market. She sells them through house to house delivery.\r\n\r\nBeing an industrious mother, Sherill is able to earn a net income of Php 700 a week which she adds to her husband\u2019s income to acquire their basic needs and to finance the schooling of their children.\r\n\r\nDue to the high cost of commodities and school expenditures, they need to earn more to meet their daily needs. Thus, Sherill is again requesting a loan amounting to Php 8,000 to be used in acquiring more frozen foods for her to sell in their village. She believes that she can improve her small business through this financial assistance, given her patience and sacrifices.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":419966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To use as additional capital for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Vista Alegre,Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2009-11-14T02:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sherill Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.3},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.3},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.3},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.3},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.29},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":14.58,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":683.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103726607,"comment":null},{"amount":7.29,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":341.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103726608,"comment":null},{"amount":7.3,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":341.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103726609,"comment":null},{"amount":7.29,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":341.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103726610,"comment":null},{"amount":138.54,"local_amount":6333.35,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":6496.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110614229,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-14T11:59:22Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T11:23:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":151969,"name":"Lesina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lesina F.

are many Cambodians who make a living as rice cultivators. One of them is Mrs. Si M., who has been working in this sector since 1979. She grows her crop on her own farmland that she inherited from her grandparents.

M. is 48 years old and married to Beneto M., who is 51 years old and works as a driver. In the long years of their marriage, they were given five children: Raymund, 21 years old; Benito, 18 years old; Kimberly, 16 years old; Nelson, 14 years old; and Maih Cecilio, 9 years old. One of their frustrations as parents is that most of their children have been able to attain only a low level of education because of they have insufficient income to pay for their educational expenses, especially since they have more children that they need to send to school. Their dream is their other children be able to finish their studies because education is one of the things they needed to fight against poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nNelly and her husband work hard for this. They have two sources of income: she is running a variety store business, and her husband works as a driver. She has been running her variety store business for 10 years now and she really wants it to grow more.\r\n<p>\r\nSince she became a member of Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), she has used every loan that she received to improve this business. She is a very good member of ASHI. She has been in the institution for 9 years; she started in the year 2000. Now, her 12th loan will be used again for this business: she will buy what her store needs, like sacks of rice, different groceries and many more items that will sell in her store. She is hoping that after buying all of these, her business will be more productive and continue growing.\r\n<p>\r\nAside from dreaming that their children would finish their studies someday, she also dreams of turning their variety store into a mini grocery store so that they will earn more for their family. That is why they will work hard--for the fulfillment of these dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":425188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To finance

The main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products, including fish and shrimp, in the local community. Julieta has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Julieta joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC, which was used to purchase raw materials for her business. Julieta is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP for the purchase of additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay for her children\u2019s schooling and the family\u2019s daily needs.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 37 years old, married, and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Elma owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling \"bagoong\"-based food. The main source of income for the business comes from preparing salted food and selling cooked food for daily meals. Elma has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elma joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Elma is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Elma from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

At present, the eldest is working abroad while their second child is teaching at San Juan Elementary School. They believe that their lives are the fruit of their patience and sacrifices. \n\nSince they are now growing old, the couple continuously works to further improve their living conditions and save for their future. Jesus cultivates their farm plots, planting rice and corn, while Ledy Jane manages their small eatery at home. Being a responsible worker, she is able to earn a net income of 4,500 PHP a month, which she uses for their daily needs and puts into savings for their future. Ledy Jane aims to improve her small eatery, but she has inadequate capital to do so. \n\nThrough Alalay sa Kaunlaran, Inc.

N., 31 years old, lives with other family members in Kompong Tom province in Cambodia. His wife named Chenglim, 31, is in the picture. The couple has a small daughter who is a clever student, learning in the local primary school. To earn a living, the family retails beds that they produce or buy from carpenters.

her desire to expand her store, Elvira T. decided to request a loan from Kiva lenders amounting to 10,000 PHP for her to purchase commodities to sell in her store. She knows that through this loan, her income will increase because she can meet the demands of her customers, thus she is really hoping that lenders will approve her loan.\r\n\r\nElvira is 48 years old and married. She and her husband live in the village of Calamagui San Pablo Cagayan, where farming is the major source of income among the residents.

Vanna S. is a villager in Tuol Kandal Village, Kandal Province. She does not have enough money to buy fertilizers to support her field; consequently, she has decided to ask for a loan.

Sina C. is from Tuol Kandal Village, Takeo Province. She is a farmer who owns a plot of land on which she cultivates rice.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Saodat tries to offer good prices to her customers while still making a profit. Saodat has requested a loan of 4300 somoni to increase her inventory.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<em><p>\r\nIMON's History<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

es una mujer muy trabajadora de 37 a\u00f1os, vive muy contenta con su esposo Carlos que tiene 40 a\u00f1os y tiene 4 hermosos hijos, pero solo vive con 2 de ellos; Andrea de 15 y Fernando de 10, porque los otros 2 mayores se encuentran estudiando en la ciudad.\n\nDesde hace 13 a\u00f1os se dedica a la preparaci\u00f3n de toda clase de panes y bizcochos; al principio se anim\u00f3 a incursionar en este negocio porque le era c\u00f3modo comprar los panes al por mayor, ya hechos y los vend\u00eda en su peque\u00f1a tienda. Pero con el tiempo se le ocurri\u00f3 la idea de prepararlos ella misma; es as\u00ed como Liza empez\u00f3 a tomar clases de panader\u00eda y algunos talleres que brindaban algunas empresas del rubro; hasta que un d\u00eda produjo sus propios panecillos, se anim\u00f3 a degustarlos y sinti\u00f3 que estaban tan exquisitos  que se atrevi\u00f3  a venderlos; desde entonces han pasado ya varios a\u00f1os, y esto la hace muy feliz porque la experiencia ha hecho conocido por sus clientes cada manjar que prepara.\nPor ello, sus panecillos son muy demandados en la zona donde vive, adem\u00e1s cuando ya est\u00e1n por salir del horno desde su casa se desprende un exquisito aroma capaz de atraer al m\u00e1s reacio de los consumidores. Liza considera su negocio muy rentable porque en su peque\u00f1a panader\u00eda tambi\u00e9n vende otros productos comestibles que le permiten obtener otras ganancias adicionales; y como es una mujer emprendedora, sin miedo a nada, ya ha pensado en ampliar su tienda y empezar a arriesgarse a preparar otras clases de panecillos.\n\nEste es el segundo pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP y est\u00e1 segura de ser cumplida porque quiere seguir trabajando para mejorar y progresar en el futuro. Con el dinero que solicita tiene pensado comprar varios sacos de harina y empezar preparar mayor cantidad de panes para venderlos, y as\u00ed salir adelante.","en":"Liza, 37, is a very hard-working woman.  She lives very happily with her 40 year old husband, Carlos.  She has four lovely children, but she only lives with two of them.  Andrea is 15, and Fernando is 10.  The older two children are attending school in the city.\r\n\r\nFor 13 years she has been making all kinds of breads and cakes.  In the beginning she was excited to start in this business because it was easy for her to buy the bread wholesale.  The bread was already made, and she sold it in her small store.  As time passed, she got the idea to make the bread herself.  That is how Liza started to take baking classes and some workshops offered by some companies in this field.  She did this until one day she produced her own breads.  She was excited to taste them.  She felt that they were so exquisite that she dared to sell them.  Since then many years have passed.  That makes her very happy because that experience made her customers know about each delicacy that she prepares.  \r\n\r\nHer breads are in much demand in the area where she lives.  Also, when the bread is just about to come out of the oven it gives off an exquisite aroma, which is capable of attracting even the most reluctant consumers.  Liza considers her business to be very profitable because she also sells other food products in her small bakery.  That allows her to get additional earnings.  As she is an enterprising woman, who is not afraid of anything, she has thought about expanding her store.  She will start to take the risk of preparing other kinds of breads.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  She is sure to repay it because she wants to keep working to improve and progress in the future.  She will use the money she is asking for to buy various sacks of flour and to start to prepare a larger quantity of bread to sell.  That way she will get ahead. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":425426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"Buy flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-12T21:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843185,"comment":null},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":401.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734773,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959838,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992683,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717466,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751201,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933754,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672658,"comment":null},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886524,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T03:03:55Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":152176,"name":"Mar\u00eda Elvira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Elvira A.

They live happily together and have a strong desire to get ahead, and in this respect they help each other. Martha produces bread and a variety of biscuits for a bakery which pays her for her services. She learned this trade by watching how the bakers work, and after a time she wanted to begin to produce on her own. She achieved this with great effort, and also a good memory; she mixed the ingredients and came up with shapes. She developed new styles of shapes of bread that today are displayed in the bakery where the customers are able to choose behind glass panels the most tempting breads that they wish to buy. Martha likes her job, and she obtains good earnings; in addition she has a small field where she grows potatoes. Her oldest daughter who works helps her economically, and the younger one helps with the household chores. The goal of the three is to succeed and to have their own bakery where they can offer the exquisite products that are created by their hardworking mother, who has managed to assume the role of father and mother without fear.

So they looked for workers and they harvested quickly, finally selling their product at a good price.\r\n\r\nAt that time they bought a car with the earnings, which is driven by her husband. Now they provide goods transport services; they are paid depending on the distance that is traveled.  But they have not left their activity of cultivating coffee, which at times is very profitable for them.  Mayamin is very pleased with her coffee farm.  From their first credit cycle to this, their second, she served as secretary of their communal bank, where she is held in high esteem.  For this reason she is very committed to making her payments on time.  The money that she is now requesting will be used to make a coffee nursery.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":425466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to make a coffee nursery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-12T22:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayamin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2009,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886528,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-13T03:23:22Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":152198,"name":"Mar\u00eda Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Teresa C.

El Cedro is in the state of Veracruz.  Development cooperatives are groups of 10 or more individuals who have a bank account and who have to meet weekly or every two weeks in order to make their payments.  This group has a representative and a governing committee, and is comprised of ten members.  \r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s representative is named Adolfo G. G\u00f3mez.  Adolfo is 48 years old, married, and has two children.  He is going to set up a stationery store in his home and needs a loan so that he can purchase blank paper, cards, and other supplies.  His customers are the children who attend the school that is situated a half block from his house.  Adolfo has been a teacher at that school for twenty-seven years.  He tells us that times are difficult, and so he decided to find other work in order to earn a little more.  Adolfo wants this loan so that he can increase his earnings and thus be able to purchase basic foodstuffs for his children. He hopes that his children will finish their studies someday and be able to purchase their own homes.  He is happy to be the group\u2019s president, since he wants to help the rest of the group, and without help from the other members they would not receive this loan.\r\n\r\nAgustina Mi\u00f1\u00f3n M. serves as treasurer on El Cedro group\u2019s governing committee.  She is thirty-three years old, completed high school, and has two children (a girl and a boy).  She makes a living selling gold, hand-sewn goods, embroideries, and paintings, and needs a loan so that she can purchase gold jewelry and cut glass.  Her customers are her neighbors and include other members of El Cedro group, who purchased jewelry and bathroom sets from her.  She has made a living from sewing for twenty-four years and learned this craft when she was in school, but she has only been painting for a little while.  Agustina wants this loan so that she can increase her business and thus increase her profits in order to pay for her children\u2019s studies and food. \r\n\r\nThe other members are:\r\n\r\nHilda L.

She purchases crops at wholesale prices and sells at retail to get more profit. She works at the business for twelve hours a day, six days a week.

Lusia thanks you for your support!\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

This is 42 year-old Kissa K. from Mbeya. She is single with 2 children, between the ages of 10 and 15. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependant because he is an orphan. \r\n\r\nIn 1998 she established a store that sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. \r\n\r\nHer store also sells second-hand clothes which come across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost, and the general appeal of anything modern. \r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Kissa currently earns about $120 US from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more used clothes and vitenge in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quality of her business. Kissa thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":425513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase more used clothes and vitenge in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-11-14T16:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kissa Y.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

He has been a carpenter for the past 40 years having learned his skill from a friend of his parents.  He has supported his family all this time through this work.  He is very proud that most of his children are now adult and fulfilled.  During this time he has manufactured doors and beds based on orders placed by his customers.  He receives orders not only from nearby residents but also from other nearby cities.  The constant use of his machinery has caused some of it to start to fail and this has brought him to seek financing for the first time from Edpyme Alternativa in the form of a 1000 new sol loan to repair and service those that need it.  He is a very responsible and hard-working father.

For the past 6 years he has earned his livelihood driving a mototaxi (motorized vehicle used in the transport of passengers and cargo).  He began with a leased one and, after much effort, was able to buy his own.  As time went by, he saved up again and bought a second unit, which is operated by a relative.  Usually, he transports his customers within the same area and even takes them to nearby cities and towns.  The profits from this work is his only stable source of income to support his family.  He tells us that during the Christmas season he buys panetones (an Italian sweet bread which is a Christmastime staple) which he distributes among the towns around his district.  The Christmas season has already begun and he thought it convenient to request help, for the first time, from Edpyme Alternativa, in the form of a 1000 new sol loan to start this activity again.  His greatest desire is to set up a grocery stall in the city market and to acquire a lot where he can build his own house.

Seven years ago, Gloria came up with the idea to make and sell tortillas since there were no similar businesses.  She prepares the tortillas from her home in the afternoons.  Every day around noon, she covers a space outside of her house with a plastic tarp in order to shield herself from the rain and the sun.

He is the coordinator for his group, \u201cActivos de Santa Fe\u201d (Assets of Santa Fe), and his story is representative of the other borrowers in the group.\r\n\r\nAlfred and his fellow borrowers from Activos de Santa Fe live in Batey Santa Fe (Holy Faith). Bateyes are small communities built up around the housing constructed by sugar companies for their workers. Bateyes are remote and difficult to access, lack potable water and any kind of reliable electricity, and have limited medical facilities, if any at all.

She likes to work in agriculture, since this is the work she has done since she was an infant, for which she works each day with a machete on the bushy growth on her banana and coffee farm, with the leadership of her husband.  Two times a week they harvest the bananas, and for this they rise at 4 in the morning until at 2 in the afternoon of the same day, they are all sold.\r\n\r\nBut her favorite thing to grow is coffee, because it allows her to save larger amounts of money in a single harvest, and with these earnings she can buy the clothing and other needs of her children who are studying.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP and she is very grateful to be part of the community bank.

The majority of the time he works alone, but during the harvests his wife helps him to collect the beans.  When the harvest is over, he sells his coffee to various collectors in his neighborhood.  With the income that he obtains, they buy the food for the home by the sackful, so that in the rest of the months the harvest of bananas is to cover the daily expeneses.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP, because of this he is very motivated and has committed to pay his installments punctually.  The money that he is asking for he thinks to invest in the purchase of chemical fertilizers for his coffee farm.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jessica Kaminsky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":425598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fredy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886534,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T19:31:44Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":152282,"name":"Calidez Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl grupo Calidez est\u00e1 integrado por Olga Mar\u00eda S., Alicia L.

","en":"The Las Rosas Communal Bank, represented by Ms. Carla Daniela, is comprised of 12 enthusiastic group members who have the desire to work and who have their own sales stands, selling street food, cosmetics by catalog, provisions, and apparel. There is fierce competition in selling provisions, and because of all their perishable items, sellers must have capital readily available so that they can obtain more goods at a lower price to replace the expired goods in a timely manner. For this reason, most of the members really need this loan so that they can have capital for any exigencies that may arise and so that they can increase their sales by offering wholesale prices. In terms of experience with solidarity groups, most of the members have previously worked with institutes similar to this one, but none has ever given them the support and trust that Fundaci\u00f3n gives them so that they can make progress with their plans to grow, thus giving their family a better quality of life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva
