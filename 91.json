She has a space in one of the markets in the town of Vahdat. Even through her family is not that big, her expenses increase over time. Her children are currently attending high school, and she wants to give them good education. Because of this, the income of her husband is not sufficient enough. Her business is the main source of income for their family. Currently, Djamily wants to purchase seasonal inventory from distributors at wholesale prices. To obtain funding for this transaction, she decided to take out a loan. After increasing the assortment of her inventory, Djamily will be able to increase her income. In addition, Vahdat residents will be able to purchase necessary products without laving the town. She plans to pay off the credit within 6 months. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u042f\u043a\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430

Kurbanov lives in the town of Vahdat. He is 21 years old and single. He has secondary education. He is in the business of buying and selling phone accessories and pre-paid cell phone cards. Firdavs has a large and strong family. Even though he is only 21, he has been working for the past 3 years. His parents are retired. Government support is not sufficient to pay for even their medicines. For this reason, immediately after graduating from high school, Firdavs began his business. Now he would like to increase the assortment of his inventory, for which he needs additional funding. After consulting with his family, he decided to take out a loan. He plans to pay off his credit in 6 months.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u041a\u0443\u0440\u0431\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432

Because customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, the women lack tangible collateral assets, and financial institutions do not consider them to be credit-worthy. This leads to poor financial support and, as a result, limited access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

Two of her children are students and her third child goes to school. She sells food and groceries at the local market. This business is the only source of income for her family at this time. Gulchehra wants to increase the variety of her merchandise, but does not have enough means. She decided to take out a loan, which will allow her to increase commodity circulation and profits. It will help support her family. Also, the locals can buy the necessary groceries in their own town at reasonable prices.

Her studies had to be interrupted after elementary school due to her parents' financial difficulties. At age 18 Helena started a small grocery store to help support herself. A year later, her partner of one year left her to care for their newborn on her own. In 1999 she used the money she made in the grocery store business to buy a piece of land, where she built a chicken coop and started raising chickens to sell \u2013 an activity she learned from her mother. Now her son, who is high-school, helps her run it. Her business has a positive impact in the commmunity, providing work for several individuals that work to resell the chickens (she supplies the local market and resellers directly from her home.)  Thing were going well until she had a setback: the brick house she built and furnished with profits from the business got partly destroyed by a fire in a nearby warehouse, which forced her to get a loan from a broker. Luckily, she heard about Hluvuku from a friend, and is now applying for a $1025.00 loan, to be paid in 16 months, to buy baby chickens, chicken feed, vaccine, and all the necessary things to grow the business. In the future, Helena hopes to expand her activities by adding egg-laying hens, and to buy a vehicle to facilitate her transportation and delivery needs. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by

She lived with her mother until she was 30 when she arranged for a home of her own where she lives alone.  A little time later she married and had 2 children.  Her husband went to South Africa searching for better conditions for the family but never again returned.<p>\r\n\r\nShe started her business when she was 20 and purchased sweet potatoes in the Manhi\u00e7a district and resold them in Ressano Garcia on the border of R.S.A.  15 years later she changed her business to selling cereals which she acquired in the center and the north of the country.  Currently she counts on 4 children two of which help her with her business.  Through a friend she learned of the existence of Hluvuku and solicited a loan for 18,000MT to purchase cereal to increase the volume of her business.<p>\r\n\r\nThis business has a positive impact on her life and on the community since it guarantees the sustenance of her family.  She was able to build a home with conventional materials and purchase furniture and kitchen appliances.  She also supplies cereal for the community.  Several women purchase cereal for resale contributing in some part to the reduction of the unemployment tax.  She intends to reopen her small commercial establishment that is closed due to a robbery.  She is going to use the earnings from the business to plaster and paint her house.<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/B><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nSaulita J\u00falio T., nascido aos 22 de Setembro de 1970 no Distrito de Manhi\u00e7a em Maputo.\r\nViveu com a m\u00e3e at\u00e9 aos 30 anos, depois arranjou uma casa propria, onde passou a viver sozinha, pouco tempo depois junta se com seu marrido e tiveram dois filhos. \r\nO marido foi \u00e1 Africa de sul a busca de melhores condi\u00e7\u00f5es para a fam\u00edlia e de l\u00e1 nunca mais  voltou.

He finished the 6th grade.  He is married and supports 7 people.  He grew up in a typical family environment, however, his father passed away when he was 10 years old, and he  says he started to have difficulties studying because he didn't have anyone to support him.  His only option was to look for work so in 1963 he was hired at the Industrial Plastic Company where he worked until he retired.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 1969 he married and moved to Catembe with his wife where they had children referenced above.  He continued working for his company as a mechanic.   He began searching for a way to keep himself busy opening a workshop to provide various services in the metal working arena with a lathe and saw in his back yard.  His level of service is good.<p>\r\n\r\nHe came to know Hluvuku through his brother that happens to be a client and has already had several loans which were paid off without problems.  With this loan of 20MT he intends to purchase a machine to cut metal for his workshop that is open at 8am and closes at 6pm depending on the demand and favorable economic conditions.  His monthly profit is around 3MT and with these earnings he is able to support a family, pay the loan, and still make some improvements on the machinery.  In the future he envisions opening a shop to wash, lubricate, and align wheels and other services and may possibly need credit.<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

familiar, por\u00e9m o pai faleceu quando tinha 10 anos e relata que come\u00e7ou a enfrentar dificuldades para estudar por falta de quem o apoiasse por isso a op\u00e7\u00e3o que teve foi procurar emprego e assim em 1963 foi contratado na Companhia Industrial de Pl\u00e1sticos onde trabalhou at\u00e9 a reforma.\r\nEm 1969 casa-se e passa a viver na catembe com sua esposa donde tiveram os filhos acima referidos e continuou a trabalhar na Companhia acima com Torneiro-mec\u00e1nico.\r\nAssim procura criar  uma forma de se ocupar criando uma oficina como forma de dar resposta aos v\u00e1rios

Generally, the owner will know all of the gossip in the neighborhood and that attracts customers who not only go there to shop but also to hear what is going on in the area. For these reasons, many people prefer despensas to supermarkets.<p>\r\n With this in mind, Gonzalina decided to open a despensa in her house.

She is 40 years old, married and has five children. She has secondary education. Marifat has a small grocery store at the market near her house. It is very convenient for the residents of the town. She brings in the merchandise from Dushanbe where she buys it wholesale. After she brings in the merchandise, she makes 20-30% profit on sales. This is not a very big income for her family. To increase her profits she needs to increase the commodity circulation and for this she plans to get a loan. By increasing the turnaround she will bring in new customers and satisfy the needs of the locals for reasonable prices. She has around 10 years experience in this field.

She uses the profits which she makes from the store to buy food for the family. Because Fayzinisso does not have enough of her own money, she decided to take out a loan to increase the variety of merchandise in her store.
