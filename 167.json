For that reason, he began an apprenticeship in shoemaking at an early age and finished it with excellent results. His energy and insight have allowed him to set himself up in business using his meager savings. With the intention of setting up his workshop, buying up-to-date tools, and ensuring the best possible service for his customers, he is requesting a loan. This will permit him to support himself appropriately and also to help his younger brothers with their school fees.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

With the money that he is requesting, he will buy bags of fertilizer for his potato ranch.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":253329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase bags of fertilizer for his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-11T20:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2566.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989634,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-12T03:46:46Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83200,"name":"Ordalina Eva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eva is a member of the Orquideas (\u201cOrchids\u201d) Village Bank.

He is married and has two children aged 7 and 12.  His wife sells nacatamales (traditional food) from home, as well as refreshments in order to help with the household expenses.  The children attend the local elementary school.  Noel has been a taxi driver for four years.  Sometimes business is bad because people do not have enough money to travel by taxi; but at other times business is good despite being tiring and sunny but profitable.  He started by renting the taxi in order to make money and with his savings he was able to buy his own vehicle which is now generating an income.  The loans from Afodenic have enabled him to make improvements to his house.  This will be his tenth loan so that he can buy spare parts to change the parts of his car which are in poor condition and therefore offer his customers better service.  His goal is to change vehicles in order to continue offer his taxi service.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":253350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","use":"To buy spare parts for his taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75.91,"local_amount":1461.97,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:23:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1514.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351557,"comment":null},{"amount":75.19,"local_amount":1448.13,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038894,"comment":null},{"amount":75.22,"local_amount":1448.82,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929190,"comment":null},{"amount":75.8,"local_amount":1459.77,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384102,"comment":null},{"amount":75.2,"local_amount":1448.22,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890565,"comment":null},{"amount":297.68,"local_amount":5733.09,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5938.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111863,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-02-12T04:41:28Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T09:38:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83212,"name":"Epifania","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Epifania S., 34, is married with 3 children.

She has worked as an executive secretary for the past two years in a private company called Detodo.Com.  She is 26 years old and lives in Lomas de Memorial Sandino, in Managua.  Her husband is a mason and they do not yet have children, but they want to have a worthy home for when they do.  This is her third loan with Afodenic.  She has made home improvements with her previous loans.  With this loan, she wants to invest in the infrastructure of her home: to replace the roof and to fix her room which is in bad shape.

Ana's parents were agriculturers, cultivating all types of crops and she helped them. But it was her husband's initiative that about 2 years ago she started growing flowers. It has been going very well, especially during Easter and in October when they sell their flowers at a better price, permitting them to earn twice their investment. During this season they are the cheapest and she prefers to dry the fruits to make them into seeds, and she prepares them to sell them at a better price. When it is out of season she prefers so dry them and not sell the flowers, and this way she can stock up and sell them as seeds instead. She says that growing flowers requires a large investment, especially for the harvest. They require so much attention, just in the transportation to the city. Ana is currently on her fifth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma (Kiva Field Partner), and all this time she has repaid her loans on time. The loan requested will be invested in the purchase of fertilizer to be able to plant again the very popular carnations, especially now that the seed is ready.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":254489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fertilizer for her flowers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-12T18:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2566.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996387,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-12T20:05:49Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83411,"name":"Idemudia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Idemudia O. is 30 years old and married with two children.

Besides, it is very profitable, especially during the months of January and March, as after that season the prices always drop. \r\nThis is the sixth time he requests for a loan from Microfinanzas Prisma, and he has never had a problem making his payments.

Yaw has been in this business for the past three years. He says what he does is risky because he does not have a bigger container to store the fuel; instead he uses smaller gallons which can catch fire. He requests the loan to buy bigger fuel containers so that he can store larger quantities of fuel for his customers. It seems Yaw is the only fuel supplier on that road; therefore the demand for fuel is high. Through this business he has supported two of his kids who are in junior high school.

Most recently, each one of them in the group received a loan of LE 700,000. That loan was a great help as it enabled them to expand their businesses, make more profit, and consequently improve their living conditions. Having repaid their last loan successfully, they have requested a loan for LE 1,000,000 each (with Rugiatu M. receiving a loan for LE 700,000). \r\n\r\nEmma (right) is the leader of the group. She is forty years of age and was born in Port Loko in northern Sierra Leone. She is married and her husband is a diamond miner. They have seven children who are between the ages of six and twenty-one. Emma sells a number of items including ready-to-wear-clothes for children, dishes, cottons and other items she discovers to be in high demand in the market. She has been in this business since her childhood days.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Emma will expand her business. She cannot tell yet exactly how much she will be able to buy as prices keep fluctuating, but she is going to use the loan to buy more of the goods mentioned above to add to the ones she already has in her stall. It is in Freetown where she buys the items she sells. Freetown is about a 390 mile(627.51 kms) round-trip from Makeni. The fare to and from Freetown is LE 24,000.\r\n\r\nSo far, Emma faces no major challenge in her business that is worth mentioning. Business is going on fine for her. This business is her only source of income and she enjoys being a businesswoman very much. With this loan and the profit it will generate for her, Emma will be able to solve a lot of her problems."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":254572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more inventory and expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-21T01:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bilkisu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Musu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rugiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3700000,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":370000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":370000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":370000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":370000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":370000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":370000},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":370000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":370000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":370000},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":370000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":156.08,"local_amount":462000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":465902.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885082,"comment":null},{"amount":93.92,"local_amount":278000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":280347.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128924,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":370000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":373125.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025713,"comment":null},{"amount":405.41,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1210135.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008516,"comment":null},{"amount":219.59,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":655489.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102859,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":370000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":373125.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019877,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":370000,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":373125.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864722,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-21T03:00:35Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:35:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83461,"name":"Cecilia Armida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1orita Cecilia Armida H.

La mayor dificultad es cuando camina largas rutas para conseguir nuevos clientes, lo cual es muy cansado, pero que es muy bien recompensado por la satisfacci\u00f3n que siente de generar ingresos econ\u00f3micos. Es la cuarta vez que C\u00e9sar est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y durante este tiempo ha demostrado ser puntual en sus pagos, lo que ha favorecido bastante para que su banco comunal sea merecedor de una renovaci\u00f3n de cr\u00e9dito, ya que el nivel de confianza es suficiente. Con el dinero que solicita invertir\u00e1 en la compra de m\u00e1s productos para de esa manera incrementar sus ventas. Cada  frasco que vende est\u00e1 valorizado en 100 soles, de los cuales, \u00e9l compra al por mayor a 75 soles, con este pr\u00e9stamo adquirir\u00e1 una caja con 46 productos.","en":"C\u00e9sar is 30 years old, single, and lives with his mother and siblings in his parents\u2019 home.  He is a young man who has worked for more than 2 years selling nutritional products by a well-known brand.  He dedicates every day to building his customer base by traveling door-to-door so he can add clients and meet the goals he has set for himself.  With this business, he can buy the necessary items to sustain himself and his mother and his goal is to have his own things and be a successful businessman.  The greatest difficulty is when he travels the long routes to attract new customers, which is very tiring; however, he is rewarded by the satisfactory feeling he gets from generating income.  This is the fourth time C\u00e9sar is requesting a loan with MFP and, over this period of time, he has demonstrated himself to be punctual with his payments.  This has been favorable for him because his cooperative bank feels confident enough in him to allow a renewal of his credit.  With the funds he requests, he will invest in the purchase of more merchandise so he can continue to grow his business.  Each bottle he sells is valued at 100.00 Peruvian soles, and he buys these at wholesale for 75.00 Peruvian soles.  With this loan, he will purchase one case containing 46 items.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

This is her fourth loan with MFP and she is very responsible  in paying her loans.  She is an active member of her community bank and is part of the director's group.  The money she is asking for this time is to buy a complete case of the products that she sells, with this she will increase her sales and her earnings.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Con mucho esfuerzo ha logrado que toda su familia tenga su negocio propio de venta de productos l\u00e1cteos y otras variedades de alimentos, es por ello que juntos preparan el yogurt que es todo un proceso de aproximadamente 60m litros por semana, tienen clientes fijos, como una escuela t\u00e9cnica de polic\u00edas que siempre consumen sus productos por la calidad que han demostrado tener en la producci\u00f3n, esto anima bastante a Rosa que tambi\u00e9n ha incursionado en hacer n\u00e9ctares y panecillos, lo que es algo dif\u00edcil por no disponer de un horno panadero, ya que a veces el horno que alquila le env\u00eda los panecillos quemados, por lo que Rosa se ha propuesto implementar su cocina.

Through a lot of hard work, the family has succeeded in building their own business, which sells dairy products and other types of foods. They produce about 60 liters of yogurt every week.  They have regular clients, including a police academy that always selects their products because they know they are high-quality.  Rosa is very inspired by this and now she is also trying her hand at making nectar drinks and baking loaves of bread, which is difficult because she does not have a bread oven. Sometimes the oven she rents burns the loaves, so Rosa is considering installing one of her own. \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan Rosa is requesting from MFP, and she has been very prompt with her repayments.

About five years ago, in addition to other crops, Delia began to plant flowers, and she is very happy with her work and what the fields she sows produce.  Last October she sold flowers at a good price because of All Souls' Day.  Twelve dozen flowers sold for between 70 and 80 soles, but at other times of the year the price drops to only 20 soles.

She also continues to plant vegetables like carrots and spinach to provide an alternate source of income for their home.  Delia has taken out five loans with MFP without a problem, and has promised to repay her sixth loan on time.  With the money she has requested, she will purchase fertilizer for the flowers.

Juana says that plowing the land is an art. Since she was a child, she has done agricultural work. She used to wake up at 4:00 am to help her mother prepare lunch, and now she does the same thing, but this time it is for her husband and children. This family sows 5 to 7 hectares of carrots and lettuce every year and then they buy plots sown with lettuce and spinach from the neighbors to take them to the markets. In each trip to the market, they earn 200 to 300 soles, depending on how they price their products. Juana is very pleased with their crops and the resale of the products, because of the rewarding earnings that she gets every time she goes to the market. The vegetables don\u2019t have a standard price. There are times, like in the summer, when the lettuce and the carrots cost as much as 50 soles per sack, but at times, the prices are as low as 20 to 25 soles per sack. Juana has worked with MFP for five consecutive loans. As such, she will repay this sixth loan with the same punctuality. With the money she is requesting, she will buy fertilizers for the cultivation of her next plots of carrots, and she is also very grateful for MFP because of the money that they loan her. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":254810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers for her plots","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T09:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3047.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996396,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T18:24:21Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83518,"name":"Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 42 a\u00f1os, es casada, tiene tres hijos, actualmente vive tan solo con dos de sus hijos, su esposo vive en otra ciudad porque trabaja en una mina.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, contains epic mountain passes, and is a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n \r\n<p>Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p> \r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they offer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":255037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase seeds and mineral fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2009-01-26T19:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahkam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3200,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":419.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":431.63},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":443.86},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":456.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":469.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":482.66},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":496.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.77},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.3},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.94},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.52},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":121.33,"local_amount":419.73,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":420.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52973607,"comment":null},{"amount":124.77,"local_amount":431.63,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T15:25:50Z","rounded_local_amount":432.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63193428,"comment":null},{"amount":128.3,"local_amount":443.86,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T17:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":445.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73621278,"comment":null},{"amount":131.94,"local_amount":456.43,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T20:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":457.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87059040,"comment":null},{"amount":135.67,"local_amount":469.36,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T00:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":470.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96973841,"comment":null},{"amount":139.52,"local_amount":482.66,"processed_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":484.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103818796,"comment":null},{"amount":143.47,"local_amount":496.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":497.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110710758,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-26T22:37:26Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T14:36:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83593,"name":"Helena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Helena A. is 52 years old.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p> \r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband and their child in Wayerma II, a popular neighborhood in Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Mrs. Assanatou D. is a trained teacher who also runs a small shop outside her home, where she's been reselling various articles (cigarettes, candies, matches, chewing gum, powdered milk, tea, sugar, etc) for ten years. She's much in demand thanks to the quality of her products. \r\n\r\nTo meet an ever-increasing customer demand, she decided to join the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso five years ago. After several solidarity loans (group loans) with other women of her neighborhood, she's now seeking her fifth individual commercial loan (PIC loan). All previous loans were repaid without problems. With this new loan, she intends to buy 5 cartons of diverse brands of cigarettes, 1 box of tea, 1 sack of sugar, 10 packs of candies, 10 packs of chewing gums, 20 packs of cigarettes, etc. Mrs. Assanatou D. sells her products for cash or on credit to a clientele of neighbors. She purchases the goods she retails from wholesalers in Sikasso. With this loan, she anticipates turning a monthly profit of XOF 80'000 (ca. US$ 160), to be mainly used to help with the family expenses and to repay the loan. The remainder will be invested in her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva

After having done many kinds of work without success, she became initiated in this work selling clothing (damask cloth and dyed light-weight scarfs) ten years ago now.  She puts the damask and scarves into dyes, which she learned to do from a friend.  She has a spot at the Sikasso bus station, where she is in high demand.  Because of this location, her business is doing superbly, with her customers composed essentially of drivers and employees working there.  \r\n\r\nIn her search for supplemental financial resources, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago.  After three solidarity loans (group loans), all correctly repaid, with a women's association in her district (Association BADEYA de Sanoubougou I), she is on her second PIC (an individual commercial loan).  She intends to use this loan to buy 18 lengths of damask, 50 packets of scarves, 5 bags of caustic soda, and 5 containers dyes of different colors.  She buys the damask, caustic soda, and dyes locally, and the scarves -- in Niono by special order.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital and to help cover family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":255078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy clothing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T05:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":31250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889537,"comment":null},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440324,"comment":null},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135698,"comment":null},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:07Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033499,"comment":null},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620867,"comment":null},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019832,"comment":null},{"amount":65.57,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:48Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242599,"comment":null},{"amount":65.66,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":32228,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678122,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T11:27:18Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83623,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace B., 50, is a hardworking business lady that sells bicycle spare parts in the Mpanga market.

N. is 26 years old and lives in a polygamous family with her husband, co-wives, and their children in Wayerma I, one of the working-class districts of the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Not having had the chance to attend school and after doing many kind of work without success, she decided to become initiated in buying and selling clothing (Wax pagnes, embroidered fabrics, dyed damask, etc.) over three years ago.  She goes door-to-door and often works with a friend at the grand marketplace of Sikasso where she is in high demand by her customers for the quality of her goods. \r\n<p>\r\nIn her search for financial resources for her clearly growing customer base, she decided to collaborate with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two months ago.  She is on her first PIC (a commercial individual loan).  She intends to use this loan to buy 5 suits of dyed damask, 5 lengths of Wax pagnes (high-grade colorful West African cloth), and 5 lengths of embroidered fabrics.  She buys her dyed damask in Bamako (capital of Mali), the embroidered fabrics and Wax pagnes in Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso), and she resells them door-to-door to customers, generally composed of women, especially during ceremonies (baptisms, marriages, etc.)\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to help cover family expenses, to pay the loan interest, and to invest the rest in her business. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":255086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy clothing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T05:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":20871.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889540,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":20871.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440327,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":20871.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135701,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:05Z","rounded_local_amount":20871.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033502,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":20871.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620870,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":20871.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019835,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:38Z","rounded_local_amount":20871.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242600,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":20871.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678124,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":20871.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112399,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":20871.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028055,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T16:22:05Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83627,"name":"Deborah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Deborah U. is a hair stylist.

After obtaining his D.E.F. (a middle-school diploma), he had no direction.  He thus came to earning an income.  He tried several kinds of work without success and then decided to become initiated in the commerce of mobile phones and accessories (handset skins, batteries, chargers, earphones, etc.) five years ago now.  He works at the crossroads of the new marketplace of M\u00e9dine where he has a shop.  He is in high demand by his customers for the quality of his goods.\r\n<p>\r\nConcerned about improving satisfaction in his burgeoning customer base, he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso five months ago.  He is on his first individual loan.  With it, he intends to buy 5 mobile phones, 1 box of skins, 1 box of batteries, 10 chargers, and 1 dozen earphones, etc.  He gets his goods in Bamako (capital of Mali) and resells them to customers generally composed of young people and especially vendors. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, he envisions realizing a monthly profit of 120,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to pay the loan interest and to invest the rest in his business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":255090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy mobile phones and accessories ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T06:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamadou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":51155.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889541,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":51155.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440328,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":51155.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135702,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":51155.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033503,"comment":null},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":51155.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620871,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":51155.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019836,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T18:18:59Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":83630,"name":"N\u00e8k\u00e8","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9 vers 1979 \u00e0 Kocoula Sous Pr\u00e9fecture de San (r\u00e9gion de S\u00e9gou), Monsieur N\u00e8k\u00e8 D. est un  monogame r\u00e9sidant avec son \u00e9pouse et leurs 2 enfants \u00e0 Wayerma I  un des  quartiers populaires de la ville de Sikasso ( troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).\nMonsieur  Neke D. n\u2019ayant pas eu la chance d\u2019aller \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t il entreprena les activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices.
