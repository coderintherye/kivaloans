It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is Lida, 47, resident of Caloocan City, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for everyday expenses and save for the future of her grandchildren.\r\n\r\nLida operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She is also a rice dealer. Lida earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece or by the kilo. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 240 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, rice and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLida hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEsperanza operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Esperanza earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells cold cuts and fish. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 278 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. A portion of the loan will be used for additional capital for her fish business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEsperanza hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to have an additional business like direct selling. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

","en":"The borrower is a married man who is father to two children. He has a fish trading business which he started seven years ago with loans from rich businessmen who actively back small fishing businesses. He has never been able to make consistent profits as a result of the exorbitant interest rates applied by his creditors. Furthermore he was under huge pressure because he had to pay all the money he took in the morning by the end of the day. This business did not give him sufficient income to provide for his family's food, health, clothing, lodging and schooling. In order to break free from these loan sharks' claws, he decided to open an account with IMCEC (a Senegalese association of mutual loan and savings institutions). He had a first loan of 250,000FCFA over 12 months which he managed to repay in just three months, and the institution left him the interest for the remaining nine months. His market share has thus grown so much that he supplies two fish-processing factories in the capital not far from his town. His ambition is moreover to get involved in the export of fresh fish to Europe and the USA. Today he is requesting a second loan of 250,000FCFA in order to satisfy strong demand by buying three crates of black \"bad\u00e8ches\" (a sea fish) and three crates of \"thiof\" (another fish, common in Senegal). The profits he makes from this investment will be used not only to provide for his family's needs but will also contribute to him achieving his short-term objective which is to buy and construct his own house.

His son also  helps with advertising and is responsible for some jobs. He says that he has lots of material but sometimes lacks the time to do the work. He works every day of the week but it varies somewhat. Sergio sends his products to Santiago by bus where they are picked up by the customer. The summer is a good time of year for selling his products as many tourists come to the area then. \r\n\r\nWith the loan Sergio plans to buy leather in a variety of colours, fasteners, and glue.  His goal is to buy a sewing machine that make more defined stitches and give a better finish. He also wishes to expand the business and teach more people how to do the work. This will generate more income for him. He says that it wouldn\u2019t suit him to have a stall or store as he only wishes to make the products, not sell them, as it would take up too much time.\r\n\r\nSergio\u2019s wife makes jam in their home. Their dream is to buy a piece of land where they can build a house. To do this, they would need to sell their current home and get some money to invest in the project. \r\n\r\nSergio is very happy and grateful for the loan obtained through Fondo Esperanza.

Lucila works in agriculture, specifically as a producer and seller of fruits such as pineapples, mangos, pacay [\"ice-cream beans\"], bananas and citrus fruits. She has been doing this work for 20 years. She recalls that when she had her first plot of land, she began to work toward her personal dream, since she had great faith, and because of this she succeeded. As soon as her first crops were ready, she sold them at the marketplace in her town, but she also sometimes went to the markets of other towns, and thus she became known among her customers. Now, she takes everything she produces to the city of Ayacucho, so that she can sell it wholesale. In this way, she is able to earn a good income, allowing her to pay the costs for educating her children. In general, she works independently, but at harvest time she needs help from laborers who take on the work of collecting the fruits. With the help of the loan, she will be able to buy fertilizers to improve the quality of her fields and later harvest high-quality fruits. Her plan for the future is to rebuild her house using solid materials, because she needs to provide security and comfort for her family. This will be her 13th loan, and she is very happy to know that she will have support from all of you.

prepares and sells a meal known as \"kenkey\" at the Abura market. To prepare her kenkey, she buys maize from the market and soaks it in water to soften the maize for three days. On the third day, she washes the maize and sends it to the mill to be milled. She then makes a mixture of dough out of the milled wet corn and leaves it for a day. She divides the risen dough into two parts and mixes one part with water to get it into a porridge-like consistency form, which she cooks until it is firm but not fully cooked. She later mixes the rest of the uncooked dough in with the half-cooked dough. She molds the dough into balls and wraps them in corn husk. She then cooks these till they become soft enough to eat.\r\n\r\nKenkey can be eaten with various kinds of sauces, such as pepper sauce. It is often served with fried or roasted fish, roasted chicken, or roasted turkey.\r\n\r\nEkua has received a junior high school education. She is unmarried and has five children. She has been preparing and selling kenkey for three years and is responsible about seeing to the well-being of her family.

Gari is a type of flour made from cassava and is a starchy food that is mostly enjoyed by students and large families in Ghana. Students eat gari a lot because it is a quick and easy food to prepare. They soak gari mix with condensed milk and water, and sometimes add peanuts. Some students also prepare gari in the form of dough and eat it with pepper sauce and sardines. Families also eat gari for lunch or supper, usually served with soup or pepper sauce. The soups that are mostly accompanied with gari are okra soup, groundnut (peanut) soup, palm nut soup, and vegetable soup. Various sauces can also be used to accompany gari, such as pepper sauce, curry sauce, or tomato sauce. The variety of the sauce served with gari depends on the family\u2019s preferences. Any kind of meat or fish can be eaten with these soups and sauces.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the gari, Adjoa obtains raw, fresh cassavas from the market. She washes and peels the cassavas, then sends them to the mill to be milled into dough. She puts the dough in a sack and places heavy stones on it. The stones are placed to drain the starch out of the dough. She leaves the dough for a day or two depending on the weight of the stones. After this process is completed, she stir-fries the gari in a pan on fire. The gari is then left to cool and finally bagged into small bags that are then offered for sale. Adjoa sells her wares at the Abura market.\r\n\r\nAdjoa and her husband, who is a farmer, have eight children. \r\n\r\nAdjoa has been selling gari for 15 years.

Her business is popular because the plant is used as a food and also for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\nIn Tlalnepantla there are many nopal producers; they transport their products to sell in different cities, or they sell to the distributors in Mexico City.

What she most enjoys about her work is caring for the plants because it makes her happy to do so.  She\u2019s been in this line of work for 10 years and considers the most difficult part having to transport her products from the field to the drying spaces located in her community so she hires day laborers to help her do this.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested loan to buy more cocoa bean plants to graft so that she can have fruit sooner.  In the future, she\u2019d like to buy new land to increase crops.  This will be loan #2 with MFP so she\u2019s hoping for a small loan that will help her meet her objectives.  She also commits once again to make her installment payments like she did with the previous loan.

Junto a su esposo, Dina trabaja todos los d\u00edas en sus tierras, con mucho esfuerzo ha logrado que sus tierras sean muy productivas y  siembra de todo un poco, ya que sabe que todo producto que obtenga ser\u00e1 de calidad. Ella principalmente siembra plantas de cacao y caf\u00e9 ya que estos son los productos que mejor se venden en el mercado.

She mainly plants cocoa and coffee plants, as these are the best selling products in the market. \n\nWhat she likes most about her job is protecting her crops from the insect infestations that can affect them and which would greatly reduce her profits.\n\nShe has spent 20 years doing this, and believes that the most difficult part is transporting their crops to the city of San Francisco, for that is where she sells her products.  On the other hand, the insect infestations affect the plants and therefore Dina will use the requested loan to buy mesh to make screens to protect the plants from the insects who take over the fruit. \n\nThis will be her tenth loan through MFP, so she hopes for a little support from lenders to carry out her plan, and she is capable of repaying all their contributions promptly, as with her previous loans.  In her community bank, she is a very supportive partner for the rest of her colleagues. \n\nWith the 3,000 New Soles, she will buy meshes by the meter to make screens and combat the insects that lurk in her crops."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":945.06,"image":{"id":818104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy several meters of mesh.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-22T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":326.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":341.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":357},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":367.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":382.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":394.61},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":408.01},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":422.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.3},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.9},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.69},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":119.63,"local_amount":326.25,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":327.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350755,"comment":null},{"amount":125.3,"local_amount":341.75,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":342.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851119,"comment":null},{"amount":130.9,"local_amount":357,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:40Z","rounded_local_amount":358.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666296,"comment":null},{"amount":134.66,"local_amount":367.25,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":368.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621453,"comment":null},{"amount":140.27,"local_amount":382.56,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":383.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835527,"comment":null},{"amount":144.69,"local_amount":394.61,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":396.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245289,"comment":null},{"amount":149.61,"local_amount":408.01,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":409.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385412,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-23T14:25:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":319001,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She and her son live with her in-laws, and what she wants most of all is to have a better income so that she can have economic stability for her beloved son.   Even at her young age, Ingrid has gone through a lot of suffering; a year ago her husband died of natural causes.  Since then Ingrid has learned to work very hard to care for her son.  She is a dentist who works in the Health Center of Santa Rosa, but on the weekends she sells clothing.  Through her efforts and the earnings she obtains, she is trying to adequately feed and educate her child.  She is grateful to the lenders for the confidence they placed in her, because thanks to their support she was able  to buy merchandise in the form of clothing.  She mentions that she already paid off the prior loan, and so she is participating in another credit cycle.  She has plans to continue to grow her business and to save her earnings, since she wants to open her own dental office in the city of Santa Rosa.  This is her second loan, and beforehand she asks for the help of all of you so that she can continue to work.  With the loan she requests, she will buy a variety of summer clothing.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":644.44,"image":{"id":818173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy more garments to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-22T20:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ingrid ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":217.53},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":227.86},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":238.03},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":244.86},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":255.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":263.1},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":272.05},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":281.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.57},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.45},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.26},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.57,"local_amount":217.53,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":223.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350758,"comment":null},{"amount":85.45,"local_amount":227.86,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:30Z","rounded_local_amount":233.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851122,"comment":null},{"amount":89.26,"local_amount":238.03,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":244.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666299,"comment":null},{"amount":91.83,"local_amount":244.86,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":251.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621456,"comment":null},{"amount":95.65,"local_amount":255.08,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:35Z","rounded_local_amount":261.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835530,"comment":null},{"amount":98.66,"local_amount":263.1,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":270.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245292,"comment":null},{"amount":102.02,"local_amount":272.05,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:28Z","rounded_local_amount":279.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385415,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-22T22:42:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":319020,"name":"Juana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana D. 41 a\u00f1os D. edad, vive con su esposo e hijos en su casa propia, cuenta con servicio s\u00f3lo D. luz, ubicada en la zona rural del distrito D.

Paulina has worked very hard since she was 19-years-old.  At that time she worked only in agriculture which only enabled her to maintain her family members.  With the savings she accumulated she opened a grocery store where she offers a variety of staple products.  This is how her stand generates good profits.  She opens the doors of her business very early in the morning to wait for her first buyers.  She mentions that the key to getting better customers is attending to them in a friendly manner and helping them with their purchases.  What she likes best about her work is having a good relationship with her customers.  Now she has been in this business for 10 years and considers the most difficult part to be having to be on her feet all day long.  Her business is going very well and thanks to this she was able to acquire more land to cultivate where her beloved husband works.  With the money from the loan she will buy supplies for her store.  With time, she hopes to expand her house and make her store bigger.
