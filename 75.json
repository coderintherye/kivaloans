She and her husband, Nicolai, have had to deal with the tragedy of losing their only daughter. They have also lived through the challenges and uncertainties of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the new opportunities provided by an independent Ukraine. Anna started her business 3 years ago when faced with difficult life circumstances.

Ni Komang Sulasmi eanrs decent income from cattle farming, besides from breeding cows that can be later sold, she can also use the cow to haul farming equipments.  It is not expensive to take care of a cow, she collects grasses from nearby pastures for feed and water from nearby stream.\r\n\r\nNi Komang Sulasmi currently plans to purchase one mature breeding cow with a loan from Dinari.  She hopes  ayear from now, the cow will produce a small cow, therefore increasing her income.

Demikian juga halnya dengan Ni Nengah Sulasmi dan keluarga. Sejak menikah dengan I Ketut Siandana, Ibu dengan dua orang anak ini hidup dari hasil pertanian dan beternak sapi. Suaminya mengerjakan tanah pertanian , Ni Komang Sulasmi beternak sapi. Berawal dari memelihara seekor induk sapi milik orang dengan sistem bagi hasil , kini Ni Komang Sulasmi sudah mendapat satu ekor anak sapi  yang sudah menjadi bagiannya. Memelihara sapi sangatlah menguntungkan bagi Ni Komang Sulasmi , karena disamping untuk di kembang biakan dengan harapan mendapat anak yang kemudian dipelihara atau dijual , tenaga sapi juga sering di manfaatkan untuk membajak tanah garapan petani. Sedangkan biaya yang di perlukan untuk memelihara sapi tidaklah banyak, cukup dengan modal tenaga untuk menyabit rumput yang tumbuh di sekitar kebun dan memberi minum di sungai terdekat.     \r\nNi Komang Sulasmi kini berencana membeli satu ekor induk Sapi yang sudah siap kawin ,dengan uang yang dipinjam dari Dinari dengan harapan satu tahun lagi sapi ini telah beranak sehingga dapat meringankan pekerjaan suaminya dan bisa menunjang perekonomian keluarganya, mengingat biaya kebutuhan sehari-harinya semakin banyak karena kedua orang anaknya yang sekarang duduk dibangku SD dan SMP juga memerlukan biaya yang semakin besar"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":131116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase Breeder Cattle Cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-03-09T07:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nengah Sulasmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-23T20:27:33Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":418181.82,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":422215.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189318,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":46,"local_amount":418181.82,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":422215.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217347,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":46,"local_amount":418181.82,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:09:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":422215.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246100,"comment":null},{"amount":46,"local_amount":418181.82,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":422215.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274805,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":46,"local_amount":418181.82,"processed_date":"2008-08-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":422215.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":304321,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":46,"local_amount":418181.82,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":422215.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335245,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":45,"local_amount":409090.91,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":413037.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369555,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

She is married to Putu Tamanaya, a Cacao farmer.  Ni Ketut Soli is very active in taking care of her family's cacao plantation.  She applies fertilizer and harvest the cacao, while her husband usually does the insecticide.  Cacao is a long term plant, as it only produces after it reaches 4 year of age.  Depending on the quality and weather, cacao can produce year round.  It usually needs fertilizing every trimester and insecticide spraying as needed.  It is usually harvested once a week.  Each kg of dried cacao can be sold for about $11 to $15.  Ni Ketut Soli is very pleased with her current result. \r\n\r\nShe plans to obtain a loan from Dinari to purchase more fertilizer and insecticide to increase the yield of her plantation.  Ni Ketut Soli is very motivated in taking care of the plantation as she hopes to improve her family's financial situation.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nNi Ketut Soli, 39 tahun, adalah wanita yang sangat ulet dan pekerja keras.  Sebagai istri dari Putu Tamayana, seorang petani Kakao , Ni Ketut Soli sangat aktif dan berperan  dalam mengelola kebun kakao keluarga ini. Dari pemupukan bahkan sampai pemetikan hasil panen dilakukan oleh ibu dua orang anak ini kecuali dalam penyemprotan hama biasanya  dilakukan oleh suaminya. Kakau termasuk tanaman jangka panjang karena tanaman ini baru bisa berproduksi setelah berumur kurang lebih 4 tahunan. Baru setelah itu tanaman ini akan berbuah terus hampir sepanjang musim dan sangat tergantung dari cara pemeliharaannya, seperti pemupukan setiap 3 bulan sekali begitu juga dengan penyemprotan sesuai dengan kebutuhan. Sedangkan untuk panen raya biasanya dilakukan pemetikan setiap seminggu sekali. Satu Kilogram kakao kering harganya berkisar Rp 10.000,- s.d 13.000,- .Ni Ketut Soli sangat senang dengan hasil yang di perolehnya saat ini. Saat ini ia berencana untuk mendapat pinjaman yang di pergunakan untuk membeli pupuk dan obat-obatan anti hama agar hasil kebun kakaonya menjadi lebih baik. Ni Ketut Soli lebih bersemangat dalam mengelola kebunnya karena ia mempunyai prinsip bahwa semua yang dilakukannya sekarang adalah untuk keluarganya"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":131123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase Fertilizer and Insecticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-03-09T00:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Soli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-23T13:02:18Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":275358.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189319,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":275358.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217348,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:09:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":275358.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246085,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":275358.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274806,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-08-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":275358.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":304322,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":275358.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335246,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":214285.71,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":229465.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369556,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

She chose this business since her village is quite isolated from urban areas, therefore, the villagers have hard time obtaining daily household needs.  She sells daily needs like rice, spices, soap and various snacks.  \r\n\r\nShe opens her kiosk at 7 am and closes it at 6om.  She earns about $4 each day.  As her business grow, her clients are requesting that she carries more merchandise, such as kerosene and farm feeds. Ni Nengah Juni Astuti wants to fulfill these requests and grow her business.  Hoerver she does not have sufficient capital.  So she applied for a $330 loan from DINARI. With this additional funding, Ni Nengah Juni Astuti plans to increase her merchandise offering and renovate her kiosk.  She is optimistic that her business will grow significantly.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer <\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nSetelah menikah dengan Putu Purnawa 4 tahun yang lalu, Ni Nengah Juni Astuti    mulai membuka warung kecil di depan rumahnya.Usaha ini dipilih Ni Nengah Juni Astuti karena di dusun tempat tinggalnya, merupakan salah satu dusun yang sangat terpencil yang jauh dari perkotaan sehingga masyarakat di tempat ini sangat sulit untuk membeli barang- barang kebutuhan sehari-hari. Barang yang dijual adalah segala kebutuhan rumah tangga seperti beras, bumbu dapur, deterjen, sabun mandi dan aneka makanan kecil.\r\n           Mulai pukul 07.00 pagi Ni Nengah Juni Astuti membuka warungnya dan tutup pada pukul 18.00 sore. Keuntungan rata rata yang di peroleh per harinya sebesar Rp. 35.000.- Seiring dengan perkembangan dan juga banyaknya permintaan dari pelanggan akan keperluan yang lain seperti minyak tanah dan pakan ternak khususnya ternak babi , Ni Nengah Juni Astuti bermaksud mengembangkan lagi usaha warungnya. Namun karena dana yang di miliki tidak cukup, Ni Nengah juni Astuti mencari pinjaman ke Dinari sebesar Rp 3.000.000,- .Dengan tambahan modal ini Ni Nengah Juni Astuti akan menambah barang daganganya dan memperbaiki kondisi warungnya agar lebih baik lagi. Ni Nengah Juni Astuti optimis usahanya akan berkembang pesat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":131127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchase goods to be sold and renovate kiosk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-03-09T00:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nengah Juni Astut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-23T13:46:27Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":275358.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189320,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":275358.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217349,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:09:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":275358.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246094,"comment":null},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":275358.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274807,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-08-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":275358.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":304323,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":275358.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335247,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":214285.71,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":229465.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369557,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

There are many occupations that was traditionally male dominated are now done by women.  Ni Luh Sutami is an example.  She has been farming cattle for the past 2 years.  Her earnings even surpassed her husband's who works as a farmer.   So her farm really helps her family's finances tremendously.  Each cow can only have a child each year.  Each infant cow that is ready for maturing can be sold for $220 to $330, depending on the gender.  In general male cows sell more than the female.  In the past year, Ni Luh Sutami earned $280 from one infant cow.  This earnings is not enough to help her husband to pay for all her family's needs., especially this year her son, Gede Artayasa is starting school.\r\n\r\nWith a loan from Dinari, Ni Luh Sutami expects to buy one more breeder cow.  She really hopes that she can produce more cows to be sold so she earns more than last year.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nSelain sebagai ibu  rumah tangga, ibu-ibu di Bali juga sangat perperan aktif bekerja atau berusaha untuk menunjang usaha \/ pendapatan suami. Banyak pekerjaan atau usaha yang dulunya dilakukan oleh kaum pria kini sudah dikerjakan oleh para wanita. Seperti apa yang telah dilakukan oleh Ni Luh Sutami. Memelihara ternak sapi yang telah ditekuni sejak 2 tahun belakangan ini telah banyak membantu perekonomian keluarganya bahkan hasil yang didapatpun tak kalah dengan pendapatan suaminya yang bekerja  sebagai petani. Seekor Induk sapi dalam satu tahun hanya beranak satu kali.Dan harga seekor anak sapi yang sudah siap untuk di pasarkan untuk bibit berkisar 2 sampai 3 juta rupiah tergantung dari jenis kelaminnya. Pada umumnya sapi jantan harganya lebih mahal di bandingkan yang betina. Dalam tahun terhakhir ini  Ni luh Sutami mendapat hasil Rp 2.500.000 dari penjualan 1 ekor anak sapi. Hasil ini dirasa belum cukup untuk bisa membantu penghasilan suaminya yang hanya sebagai petani kecil. ( penggarap tanah orang lain) Apalagi tahun ini  Gede Artayasa anaknya harus masuk sekolah sehingga Ni Luh Sutami memerlukan biaya tambahan .      \r\nDengan modal pinjaman dari Dinari , Niluh Sutami  membeli satu ekor Induk sapi lagi bahkan saat ini kedua induk sapi peliharaan Ni luh Sutami sedang hamil. Besar harapan Niluh Sutami sapi-sapi peliharaanya bisa melahirkan dengan selamat, sehingga tahun ini dia bisa mendapatkan hasil dari jerih payahnya lebih banyak dari tahun yang lalu ."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":131129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase Breeding Cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-03-08T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Luh Sutami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-23T07:24:07Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":348786.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189321,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":348786.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217350,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:09:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":348786.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246102,"comment":null},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":348786.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274808,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-08-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":348786.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":304324,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":348786.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335248,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":311111.11,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":321251.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369558,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

He farms chicken to be slaughtered that takes about 35-40 days from birth to slaughter.  An average mature chicken weighs about 2kg and can be sold for $1 per kg.  I Nyoman Switra farms about 4000 chickens.  He is assisted by his wife and a contract worker that he pays about $110 per harvest.  I Nyoman Switra's chicken farm is his family's only source of income since he retired from his post as his village head.  He gets decent income from the farm, but it also carries significant risk as his chickens are vulnerable to disease and his yield can vary with temperature and weather.  Therefor he needs to keep up the environment and spend some money on vaccines and drugs.  Each harvest, I Nyoman Switra can earn up to $110 to $170 by selling his chickens to larger wholesaler who has been I Nyoman's regular client.  \r\n\r\nI Nyoman Switra needs additional fund to afford higher price of feeds and to renovate his chicken cages.  He hopes that his chicken farm can grow.  He needs to pay for his children's tuition.  One of his children is currently in college, and the other is still in Junior high school.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\nBeternak ayam telah di tekuni I Nyoman Switra Sejak tahun 2005 . Ayam yang di pelihara adalah  ayam pedaging. Masa pertumbuhan ayam ini dari   sejak lahir hingga siap panen berkisar 35 sampai 40 hari , dengan berat badan rata-rata 2 kg sedangkan harga perkilogramnya Rp 9.200,- . I Nyoman Switra memelihara 4.000 ekor ayam. Ia di bantu oleh istri serta seorang tenaga kerja yang di gaji sebesar Rp. 1.000.000,- per sekali panen . Memelihara ayam bagi I Nyoman Switra adalah satu \u2013satunya sumber pendapatan keluarga sejak dia pensiun menjadi kepala dusun . Hasil yang di peroleh pun sangat menjanjikan . Namun resiko yang dihadapi juga cukup tinggi karena ayam jenis ini sangat rentan dengan serangan penyakit dan sangat terpengaruh pada suhu \/cuaca ,sehingga memerlukan lingkungan yang sehat dan juga modal yang cukup untuk persediaan obat-obatan ataupun vaksin. Dalam sekali panen I Nyoman Switra meraup keuntungan berkisar  1 sampai 1,5 juta rupiah. Sedangkan hasil panen  I Nyoman Switra  langsung diambil oleh pedagang besar yang sudah menjadi pelanggan tetap .   \r\nI Nyoman Switra memerlukan tambahan modal untuk membeli pakan ayam yang saat ini semakin mahal dan juga untuk merenopasi kandangnya yang sudah mulai rapuh , Dan besar harapan I Nyoman Switra peternakan ayamnya bisa lebih berkembang ,sehingga dapat menunjang biaya pendidikan anaknya yang kini telah duduk di bangku kuliah dan satu lagi masih SMP."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":131134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase Chicken Feed and Repair Cages","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-03-08T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"I Nyoman Switra","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-23T05:59:36Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":418181.82,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":422215.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189322,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":46,"local_amount":418181.82,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":422215.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217351,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":46,"local_amount":418181.82,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:09:13Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":422215.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246087,"comment":null},{"amount":46,"local_amount":418181.82,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":422215.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274809,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":46,"local_amount":418181.82,"processed_date":"2008-08-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":422215.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":304325,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":46,"local_amount":418181.82,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":422215.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335249,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":45,"local_amount":409090.91,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":413037.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369559,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

They use many kinds of accesories for the prayings, such as Canang with various shapes with many varieties of flower. \r\nNi Nengah Sotri is a mother who see this opportunity to make some money. She provides various kind of religious accesories. She uses some materials such as Janur (coconut leaves) including including young and old leaves. This kind of material is quite easy to find in her neighbourhood. Besides selling daily religious accessories, Ni Nengah Sotri also take some package orders for bigger religious events such Otonan (birthday), Odalan (big religious ceremony), and so on. \r\nFor these package orders, she needs bigger capital. She also usually needs help from her relatives. By joining DINARI foundation, Ni Nengah Sotri not only receives loan, but also gets some consultancies and advice for making a better business. Everyday Ni Nengah Sotri does her housework such as cooking and taking care of the children. After the housework, she starts working on her business. Her net profit is around Rp 20,000 to Rp 25,000 per day. She uses the profit to cover the family's expenses. Her husband is construction labor with irregular income. Thanks to this business, Ni Nengah Sotri can help support the family.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nKegiatan masyarakat asli Bali adalah sembahyang. Banyak alat - alat yang dipakai untuk menunjang prasarana sembahyang, antara lain yang disebut  Canang dengan  beraneka ragam bentuknya, dan aneka macam bunga sebagai pelengkapnya.\r\nNi Nengah Sotri adalah salah seorang ibu yang dapat memanfaatkan kesempatan tersebut sebagai salah satu usaha yang dapat menghasilkan uang. Beraneka macam barang - barang yang dapat menunjang persembahyanggan disediakan. Bahan baku yang dipakai adalah   Janur  ( daun kelapa ) baik yang masih muda maupun yang sudah tua. Bahan baku ini sangat mudah dicari di daerahnya. Selain menjual bahan-bahan untuk sarana persembahyangan secara harian, Ni Nengah Sotri juga melayani aneka macam sarana sembahyangan secara besar \/ paket Otonan ( Ulang tahun )  dan Odalan ( Upacara keagamaan yang besar ) dan lain-lain.\r\nUntuk pesanan dalam bentuk paket  inilah yang  biasanya sangat memerlukan modal besar.

A. lives in the city of Tursun-zoda. He is 28 years old, is married and has no children. He has finished high school. <p>\r\n\r\nIkrom is a taxi driver. He has 4 years of experience. Currently, Irkom can not make profit with his business, because gasoline prices have increased. The client would like to install equipment for natural gas. This is the reason why Ikrom is applying for a loan. If the client installs natural gas equipment, then he will decrease the taxi fee. This will give people an opportunity to use his taxi at more affordable prices. Irkom plans to repay his loan within 7 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0435\u0432

She began selling fruits throughout different parts of the nearby mountains. Little by little she offered a greater variety of fruits and made a little bit of capital.

U. lives in the region of Abdurahmon Jomi. He is 49 years old, married and has 4 children. He has a secondary technical education and is a carpenter by profession. He is in the animal husbandry business. He buys young calves, feeds them for about 40-45 days and then resells at a higher price because grown calves cost more and are used for meat. Afterwards he buys new batch of calves, feeds them and then resells and that is the scheme by which his business runs. This business helps to support his family as Saidhudja is the sole provider. Besides, the development of animal husbandry in the region provides the markets with fresh meat at reasonable prices. Saidhudja has been in this business for the past five years. He plans to use the loan to buy more calves. He plans to pay off the loan within 10 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\u042e\u0441\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0432

S. lives in the region of Abdurahmon Jomi. He is 52 years old, married and has five children. He has secondary education and no profession. He is in the animal husbandry business. He buys young calves, feeds them for about 40-45 days and then resells them at a higher price because grown and fed calves cost more and are used for meat. He then buys new batch of calves, feeds them and resells and that is the scheme by which runs his business. It allows to support his family because Jurabek is the sole provider. Besides, the development of animal husbandry provides markets with fresh mean at reasonable prices. Jurabek has been in this business for the past five years. He plans to use the loan to buy more calves. He plans to pay off the loan within 10 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

He is 47 years old, married, and has 6 children. He has a high school education. He has been in the business of cattle breeding for 9 years. He purchases young bulls, feeds them intensively for 40-45 days, and resells at higher prices as those bulls cost more and are used later on for meat. After that, he purchases new bulls and repeats the process - that is how his business works. This business helps him to maintain his family, since this is a single main source of income for Asomiddin's whole family. Apart from that, development of these types of businesses help to supply markets with good meat at moderate prices. He plans to pay off the credit within 10 months. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0421\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432

E. lives in the city of Dushanbe. He is 35 years old, married, and has 2 children. He has college education. He works in GAUP \"Tajik Air\" as a shooter (she shoots birds so they would not interfere with airplanes). He asks for a credit to fix his house as it is very hard for him to accumulate the needed amount of money on his own. A better way for him is to obtain a loan and repay it using his regular income within 14 months. This will give him an opportunity to fix his house and live in better conditions.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva

S. lives in the town of Vahdat. She is 53 years old and has 5 children. She has high school education. She does not have any other source of income except for the proceeds from sales of milk from the cow that she currently has. She has been in this business for the last 6 years. She plans to use the loan towards a purchase of another milk cow. She will be able to increase her income by selling more milk. At this time, the prices for cattle are low because of the general lack of cattle food. Thus, this will be a profitable purchase for Ruzigul and for the local residents, who will be able to purchase fresh milk at good prices. She will be paying off the loan within the next 10 months.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva

J. lives in the town of Vahdat. She is a 50 year old widow with 6 children. She has high school education. She works in a child care facility as an administrator. She also holds a cattle business. She has a single milk cow, whose milk she uses for her family and for resale. She has been in this business for the last 6 years. Using the credit, she plans to purchase another milk cow and to sell its milk; thus, increasing her overall income. Currently, the prices for cattle are low because of a lack of cattle food. For this reason, this purchase will be profitable for Sharifgul and will also benefit local residents, who will be able to purchase fresh milk at good prices. She will be paying off the load during the next 10 months.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva

The humble life has made her more driven to make a better living by breeding goats. She started this business as her neighbourhood has abundant food supply for breeding goats. Due to the limited capital, Ni Komang Notri only raises 4 goats. The goat cost Rp. 300,000 each and it can be sold 5 months later with price of Rp. 600,000 - Rp. 700,000 each so she can get profit of Rp. 800,000 after deducting the maintenance cost. Although the profit is not much, Ni Koming Notri is still grateful that she can support the family's economy thanks to this business. Furthermore, her wish to renovate her house has encouraged her even more to save some of the profit. After getting the loan from DINARI, Ni Komang Notri becomes more enthusiastic in the business and she wants to buy 3 more female goats so that she can breed more goat offsprings and she doesn't need to buy more goat offsprings. She hopes with this she can gain more profit so that she can make a better living for the family.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nTinggal di rumah yang sangat sederhana yang hanya berdinding bata  tidak membuat Ni Komang Notri dan keluarganya patah semangat dalam menjalani kehidupan. Segala kesederhanaan itu justru membuatnya bersemangat dalam bekerja untuk bisa hidup lebih baik lagi yaitu dengan  memelihara kambing. Hal ini dilakukannya mengingat situasi lingkungan yang mendukung yaitu dengan tersedianya pakan yang cukup bagi keperluan ternaknya ini.  Terbatasnya modal yang dimiliki mengharuskan Ni Komang Notri hanya memelihara 4 ekor Kambing . Kambing itu dibeli dengan harga Rp. 300.000 per ekor,- dan  dalam waktu 5 bulan berhasil dijualnya dengan harga Rp. 600.000,- Rp.700.000 per ekor sehingga keuntungan bersih yang diperolehnya Rp. 800.000,- setelah dikurangi biaya pemeliharaan. Walaupun keuntungan yang diperolehnya tidak banyak tapi Ni Komang Notri tetap bersyukur karena keluarganya bisa hidup dari hasil usahanya tersebut. Keinginan untuk merenovasi rumahnya membuat Ni Komang Notri terpacu untuk mulai menyisihkan sedikit hasil usahanya ini.. Setelah menerima pinjaman modal usaha dari DINARI Ni Komang Notri menjadi lebih bersemangat lagi dalam usahanya  dan ingin membeli 3 ekor induk kambing agar nantinya induk kambing ini mempunyai anak dan Ni Komang Notri tidak perlu membeli bibit untuk kambing penggemukan lagi ia hanya memelihara anak tersebut,dengan harapan keuntungan yang diperoleh akan lebih meningkat dan keluarganya bisa sejahtera."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":131581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Moreover her husband\u2019s income as farmer is not enough to meet the family daily needs and profit from her kiosk can only enough to support her kitchen expenses at home. Fortunately Dinari gives her loan so she can expand her business by selling staple necessities. She uses the loan to buy rice, sugar, eggs, and other staple foods. She is hoping that the profit will increase then she can keep her children at school and save some to improve her kitchen. She works tirelessly; opening her kiosk from 7 AM until 10 PM. Ni Komang Situasi does this full hearted and full of spirit only to get her children better and higher education as possible and assure them better future than she is.<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Iman Persada, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>Dalam situasi ekonomi seperti sekarang ini sangat sulit bagi Ni Komang Situasi untuk bisa menyekolahkan keempat anaknya. Apalagi penghasilan suaminya sebagai petani tidak mencukupi untuk memenuhi kebutuhan keluarga. Sedangkan keuntungan yang diperoleh dari warungnya selama ini hanya cukup dipakai untuk keperluan dapur. Untungnya Dinari memberi pinjaman modal sehingga Ni Komang Situasi bisa memperbesar usaha warungnya dengan berjualan kebutuhan pokok. Pinjaman ini dipergunakan untuk membeli beras,gula pasir,telor,maupun kebutuhan pokok lainnya. Hal ini diharapkan agar keuntungan yang diperoleh menjadi bertambah sehingga anak-anaknya tetap bisa sekolah dan sedikit demi sedikit Komang Situasi berharap bisa menabung karena ia ingin memperbaiki dapurnya yang selama ini masih berdinding bede dan berlantai tanah. Oleh sebab itu Komang Situasi tidak mengenal lelah,ia berjualan dari pagi pukul 07.00 wita dan baru tutup pada pukul 22.00 wita. Ni Komang Situasi melakukan usaha ini dengan sepenuh hati dan bersemangat karena ia ingin anak \u2013 anaknya dapat menempuh pendidikan setinggi mungkin agar masa depan mereka lebih baik dari yang dialaminya sekarang."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":131583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Additional to working capital to buy more goods and improve kiosk condition","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-03-09T13:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang Situasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-23T16:00:02Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":349328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189323,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":349328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217352,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:09:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":349328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246096,"comment":null},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":349328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274810,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-08-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":349328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":304326,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":349328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335250,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":311111.11,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":321750.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369560,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

Her family depends on the what she grows.  Up to this point, the most productive crop she has grown is cocoa trees.  However, because of a change in the weather and climate due to global warming the production of cocoa in Bali has been changed.  The biggest cocoa trees have undergone a decrease in the production of good fruit so that quality and quantity are under threat.  The price for dried cocoa beans was once 14,000 Rupiah\/kg and has now dropped drastically to 9,000 Rupiah\/kg.  Seeing this problem, Ni Ketut Suadri has worked hard to restore the condition of her cocoa trees to what they once were.  Unfortunately, because of the limitations of her funding she can only do the most basic work like trimming and cleaning each tree.  Ni Ketut Suadri would like to do more to help the production of her trees by purchasing fertilizer and temporary medicine to eradicate plant disease.  Ni Ketut Suadri is optimistic that the treatment and fertilizer will create a much better environment for her trees and that they will quickly recover and produce fruit again.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lender\/courtenaychris\">Courtenay Teska Race<\/a>, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMenjalani hidup sebagai petani di lingkungan pedesaan adalah hal yang umum bagi warga masyarakat di Bali, tetapi bagi Ni Ketut Suadri kegiatan bertani ini tidak hanya dijadikannya sebagai rutinitas belaka tetapi  benar-benar di lakukannya dengan sungguh-sungguh karena sampai saat ini kehidupan keluarganya mampu dipenuhi dari hasil kebunnya. Saat ini hasil produksi kebun yang paling bagus adalah dari tanaman kakaonya. Dalam beberapa tahun terakhir penghasilan dari tanaman kakao cukup menjanjikan karena selain  harga yang cukup tinggi, hasil produksinya juga cukup banyak. \r\nNamun karena perubahan cuaca dan iklim sebagai dampak dari pemanasan global berpengaruh terhadap hasil produksi tanaman kakao di Bali. Sebagian besar tanaman kakao yang ada mengalami penurunan dalam produksi buahnya baik secara kualitas maupun kuantitasnya. Harga biji kakao kering yang semula bisa mencapai Rp 14.000,- per kg turus drastis sampai ke level Rp 9.000,- . Melihat hal ini Ni Ketut Suadri berusaha keras untuk memulihkan keadaan tanaman kakaonya. Tetapi karena terbatasnya dana yang dimilikinya Ni Ketut Suadri hanya bisa mengerjakannya dengan cara sederhana seperti menyiangi dan membersihkan  setiap pokok tanaman kakaonya supaya kebersihannya terjaga dengan baik. Ni Ketut Suadri ingin melakukan hal yang lebih baik lagi untuk memulihkan produksi kebunnya dengan memberi pupuk dan juga penyemprotan obat pembasmi hama. Kemudian ada bantuan pinjaman modal dari DINARI dan ini dimanfaatkannya pengadaan pupuk dan obat pembasmi hama bagi tanaman kakaonya.Ni Ketut Suadri optimis, dengan adanya perawatan tanaman yang baik kondisi tanaman kakaonya akan segera pulih dan bisa menghasilkan buah lagi."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":131586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizer and anti-desease medicine for her cocoa trees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-03-09T04:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Suadri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-23T13:02:16Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":349328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189324,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":349328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217353,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:09:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":349328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246081,"comment":null},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":349328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274811,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-08-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":349328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":304327,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":349328.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335251,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":311111.11,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":321750.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369561,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

This includes the education of their child who is still in primary school.  The income her husband makes as a laborer does not meet all of the needs of their family.  Hence, Ni Ketut Parni operates and manages farmland to increase her family's income.  The main crop in her farmland is cocoa trees, which she still grows using traditional methods without fertilizer or pesticides.  Her production is sufficient to cover her expenses.  However, several months ago her production decreased because of a pest infestation and high rainfall which has prevented the cocoa trees from producing good fruit.  The drop in production along with an increase in the cost of living has hit her family hard.  She isn't able to purchase fertilizer or medicine to cure her plants because she does not have enough capitol.  Due to this lack of funding, she is not able to get her cocoa trees to produce fruit at their maximal rate.  She hopes that a with a loan, she will be able to purchase the fertilizer and plant medicine that will allow her to produce good cocoa fruit again.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lender\/courtenaychris\">Courtenay Teska Race<\/a>, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDalam usia yang masih cukup muda Ni Ketut Parni menunjukkan keuletannya dalam membantu suaminya I Ketut Royen dalam memenuhi segala keperluan hidup mereka, baik itu untuk di dapur maupun biaya-biaya lainnya termasuk biaya pendidikan anaknya yang masih di sekolah dasar.

Hasil produksi yang diperoleh cukup untuk bisa menutupi pengeluaran-pengeluaran yang ada. Namun dalam beberapa bulan terakhir jumlah produksi tanaman kakaonya menurun  karena serangan hama dan tingginya curah hujan yang menyebabkan tanaman kakaonya tidak bisa memproduksi buah yang bagus sehingga pendapatannya juga jauh berkurang sedangkan biaya hidup semakin bertambah. Untuk pengadaan pupuk ataupun obat pembasmi hama tidak bisa dilakukannya karena terbatasnya modal yang dimiliki, sehingga perawatan atas tanaman kakaonya tidak bisa dilakukan dengan maksimal. Kemudian DINARI memberinya bantuan modal usaha dan itu dimanfaatkannya untuk membeli pupuk dan juga obat pembasmi hama, dengan harapan tanaman kakaonya bisa menghasilkan buah yang baik."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":131601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase fertilizer and anti-desease medicine for her cocoa trees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-03-09T04:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Parni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-23T07:24:07Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":348068.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189325,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":348068.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217354,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:09:13Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":348068.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246089,"comment":null},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":348068.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274812,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-08-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":348068.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":304328,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":348068.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335252,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":35,"local_amount":311111.11,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":320589.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369562,"comment":"scheduled_repayment (late autopay posting for DINARI Foundation -

Besides supporting her family by buying and selling second-hand goods & recyclables, Siti Maemunah also has a store where she sells snacks and drinks.  Times are very difficult right now because she is not making enough to support their family.  All of the profits she makes from her store go into making her snacks.  She has one child who is not married and two grandchildren that live with her since their parents have gone to work Java.  Seeing the situation, Siti Maemunah wishes to grow her business by selling bakso (meatball soup) and nasi goreng (fried rice).  To accomplish this she would like to borrow 1,000,000 Rupiah for her business.  She hopes with this loan she will be able to grow her business and better support her family and be able to send her two grandchildren to school.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lender\/courtenaychris\">Courtenay Teska Race<\/a>, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nSiti Maemunah seorang ibu rumah tangga yang harus bekerja keras untuk menghidupi keluarganya. Suaminya yang dulu seorang sopir kini mengalami kebutaan secara total pada kedua matanya karena kerusakan pada syaraf. Selain menjalankan usaha keluarga yaitu jual beli ban bekas, Siti Maemunah juga mempunyai usaha warung yang menjual minuman ringan dan makanan ringan. Hal ini dilakukan karena usaha keluarga tidak mencukupi untuk biaya sehari-hari yang harus dikeluarkan. Keuntungan yang diperoleh dari usaha warung ini dipakai untuk keperluan dapurnya. Karena Siti Maemunah menanggung satu orang anak yang belum menikah dan juga dua orang cucunya yang ditinggal oleh orangtuanya ke Jawa. Melihat situasi yang memungkinkan untuk usaha warung tersebut maka Siti Maemunah berkeinginan untuk menambah usahanya dengan berjualan bakso dan nasi goreng. Makanya Siti Maemunah minta pendampingan dan pinjaman modal dari Dinari sebesar Rp.1.000.000 untuk usahanya ini.

She has 2 years of experience in this field. She purchases goods from the city of Dushanbe and sells them on the market. This ensures that local markets have goods, which means that locals do not have to spend money in order to travel to Dushanbe and purchase goods there.
