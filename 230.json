Uraz has put much effort into his agricultural activities. Despite the difficult economic situation that he has gone through, he has managed to support his family and provide his three children with everything they need. To develop his business, Uraz has made use of loans provided by IMON International, which he has used toward technical assistance for his crops. Once again, Uraz seeks loan support from IMON International to invest in his crops, raise his harvest, and survive along with his family. With your help, Uraz will be able to get ahead.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Shahodat is 52 years old. For fifteen years Shahodat has been working as a market vendor. She sells plates and dishes made in an oriental style in the central local market, which are very popular among the local populace. This kind of china is also widely used for girls' dowry and also for family celebrations. Now Shahodat is planning to enlarge the range of goods she sells by purchasing more china. Hence, she is requesting 2,000 Somoni. Shahodat is an existing IMON client with good credit history, and promises to repay the loan promptly. She thanks everyone supporting her.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road. It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities who still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Till today, it remains a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. Civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous with only 7% of the land being arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural and manufacturing sectors, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Laura has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 pesos from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Laura is requesting a new loan of 10,000 pesos which will be used to purchase additional products to sell in her \"sari-sari\" or general store.

years ago, Uguloy started her business of selling the national women's dresses. Experienced and talented in the business, Uguloy has expanded her business into a successful trade, supporting her family of two children. Throughout the last year, IMON International has provided assistance to Uguloy\u2019s business through microfinance loans. Committed to growth and successful entrepreneurship, Uguloy has used her previous loans wisely and has repaid each with a perfect credit history. Currently, she is seeking a loan of 3600 Somoni to replace the depleted inventory, hoping to continue expanding her business and supporting her family.    \r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<P>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

D. is from the village of Tumpagon, Cagayan De Oro City. She is 55 years old. Perlita is widowed and has seven adult children. To make a living, Perlita owns & operates a business raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale. Perlita has been engaged in her business for over 30 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Perlita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Perlita is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business and to partly help in building her house. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Perlita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":334324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To expand

T. is from the village of Tumpagon, Cagayan De Oro City.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste, canned goods, and other products in the local community. Rosalie has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rosalie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. <P>\r\n\r\nRosalie is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Rosalie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her children's education and to provide the needs of the family. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:<P>\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Pai de 12 filhos: com idades compreendidas entre os 5anos aos 25 anos de idade. A mais velha j\u00e1 casada e os restantes v\u00e3o \u00e0 escola.   \nJequicene sai de Inhambane a Namaacha, uma vila na fronteira de Swazil\u00e2ndia, a procura de emprego. Come\u00e7a a trabalhar como guarda nas irm\u00e3s franciscanas durante 12 anos. Mas devido ao elevado custo de vida, pois este ganhava pouco, come\u00e7a a praticar neg\u00f3cio de venda de potes abandonando assim o emprego e dedicar se mais aos neg\u00f3cios que lhe davam bons lucros. Com o rendimento dos neg\u00f3cios ele consegue construir duas casas, uma v\u00eas que tem duas Esposas, e ainda comprar uma viatura para lhe facilitar no seu trabalho. Agora para al\u00e9m da venda de potes, faz transporte semi-colectivo de passageiros (vulgo chapa) e tem um rendimento di\u00e1rio de 200.00mtn e tamb\u00e9m faz cria\u00e7\u00e3o de frangos.

He is single, 49 years old, and studied until fifth grade.  He had to stop school because of a lack of transportation, since the school was very far from his house.  He is the father of 12 children, whose ages range from five to 25 years old.  The oldest is already married and the rest go to school.\r\n\r\nJequicene left Inhambane for Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, looking for work.  He began by working as a guard for Franciscan sisters for 12 years.  But because of the rising cost of living, and because he wasn't earning much, he began a business selling earthenware pots and gave up his job to concentrate on more lucrative businesses.  With his business earnings, he managed to build two houses, since he had two wives, and also bought a vehicle to help him with his work.  Now, in addition to selling earthenware pots, he provides informal public transportation services and has a daily income of 200 mtn.  He also raises chickens.  This occupation he learned with the Franciscan sisters (where he would spend 12,000 mtn to raise 200 chicks).\r\n\r\nThis poultry business earns an income of 5,000 mt in every cycle, and it is growing with the loan he had from Hluvuku-Kiva.  These days, raising 500 chicks costs 30,000 MT in each phase, and therefore has a profit of 12,000MT.  And he manages to pay family expenses (caring for his parents who live with him in his house) and his children's studies.  Each month he is able to save 3,000 MT.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan for Jequicene with Hluvuku and Kiva.  The first 18,000 MT were used to grow his chicken raising business.  He managed to repay it with no problem, and asks for this second loan of 22,000 MT to enlarge the size of his stock.  He is confident that he will repay it ahead of time and and ask for a new loan to grow his business, each time a little more.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva

When she arrived to the capital she studied but interrupted her studies when she got pregnant with her boyfriend. Her uncle turned her away saying he couldn't be responsible of her and her new born. Her life turned difficult and she was able to get a job as domestic assistant where she worked for 3 years, with the money she saved, she started her own business selling pots bought in Maputo and sold in Namaacha a village near the frontier with Suazilandia where she met her current husband who lived in that district.\r\nYears later she moved in with her husband and life and business turned easier. Today she owns a spot to sell pots at the market that works twice a week (Wednesdays and Saturdays). Thanks to Hluvuku and Kiva she has been able to travel twice a week to increase her stock. Her best pots are the numbers 1x20 and 4x20. She buys them at 120mt and 250mt and sells them at 270mt and 350mt respectively. Rosalina watched her business grow with the loans obtaining a monthly income of 7.000mt and gaining a profit of 1.000mt. Besides her two children she is responsible for her parents in law who live with her at home. She is also looking to buy furniture.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva. The first two were used to increase her business and she is requesting the third to increase the volume of her stock, she is confident she will pay it back on time and will request a new loan to build a stable store to sell her pots.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Nina Delgado, Kiva

She is 40 years old and the mother of 4 children with ages between 8 and 25 years old.  The three youngest are in school.\r\n\r\nAlice, after completing elementary school, was transferred to the town of Namaacha, which is 25km from Goba where she was born.  She continued with her schooling and made it through the 7th grade, but she became pregnant and went to live with her husband abandoning her education.  Her husband was a great businessman.\r\n\r\nYears later her husband passed away from an illness, and her life became difficult.  She was able to arrange a job in the capital (Maputo) as a housekeeper, and she worked for 2 years and earned 2,300MT.  She had to quit since she lived far from her children so she returned again to Namaacha where she started her own business of selling bread and candies from her yard.  In the attempt to grow the volume of her business she approached Hluvuku and solicited a loan in the amount of 10,000MT.\r\n\r\nHer best product is bread which she acquires in neighboring Swaziland.  Besides her children Alice is not responsible for anyone.  She is able to save a little each month.  She says that she will be able to pay off this loan without difficulties, and she will request other loans to grow her business as well as realize her other future plans.<br \/><p><strong>Translated

She is a single mother with three kids between the ages of 4 and 13, the two youngest children study at the local public school.\r\n\r\nArgentina studied through the seventh grade of the the old Mozambican education system, but was forced to stop as her parents could not afford the costs of her studies (they lived far away from the high school and could not afford money for transport to and from school). Argentina is a very experienced businesswoman with 15 years of experience and has dealt with many different products. She currently sells scarves and blankets that she buys in neighboring South Africa for 450 rand (ZAR) and is able to resell in Mozambique for 2,500.00MT each. She is able to make 400,000MT a day which she uses to support her children and pay for other family expenses. Argentina lives in a home that she owns and built with much sacrifice.\r\n \r\nThis is the first time that Argentina has borrowed money from Hluvuku-Adsema through Kiva. She learned about Hluvuku-Adsema through friends. She intends on further expanding her business and diversifying her products to satisfy demand and earn more money. She has plans in the near future to build a house for her children and hopes that Kiva loans will help her to achieve this.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Cameron Morris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":334541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase her business inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-06-15T18:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Argentina De Lurdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":659.14},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":688.93},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":720.08},{"due_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":752.63},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":786.65},{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":822.21},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":859.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":898.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":938.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":981.28},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1025.64},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1072},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1120.46},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1171.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1224.05},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1279.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.27},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.41},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.6},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.85},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.52},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.94},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.43},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.99},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.32},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.95},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.27,"local_amount":659.14,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:53:49Z","rounded_local_amount":686,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63190991,"comment":null},{"amount":26.41,"local_amount":688.93,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":717,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63190992,"comment":null},{"amount":27.6,"local_amount":720.08,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":749.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73618870,"comment":null},{"amount":99.1,"local_amount":2585.13,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2690.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056710,"comment":null},{"amount":190.79,"local_amount":4977.04,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5179.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708804,"comment":null},{"amount":75.89,"local_amount":1979.68,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-22T08:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937731,"comment":null},{"amount":0.01,"local_amount":0.2,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-22T07:52:21Z","rounded_local_amount":0.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128971833,"comment":null},{"amount":129.93,"local_amount":3389.8,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3527.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151915870,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:19Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":114798,"name":"Sensa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Sensa M. is a Tanzanian micro entrepreneur and a married woman.

She is 43 years old, is a widow and lives with her three nieces. She was not able to attend school as a girl because her parents could not afford transport to and from school. She left Inhambane (600km north of the capital city, Maputo) when she separated from her first husband. When she arrived in Boane she married another man, the relationship only lasted 4 years as her husband lost his life in 1991 during the Mozambican civil war. After her husband's death she was forced to find work and found it at the Umbeluzi Agriculture Station (the Umbeluzi river passes through Boane) where she has worked to this day.  She has received and repaid three loans (5,000.00MT, 8,500.00MT) with Hluvuku-Adsema helping her to build a home to replace the precarious home she was living in after her husband's death.\r\n\r\nShe has never obtained credit from another bank.

He studied through the 5th grade but had to stop as his parents could not continue to afford the costs of his studies. His elderly mother lives with his family. Jorge is a civil servant that has worked at the Boane Institute of Agriculture for the past 12 years where he receives a monthly salary of 2,650.00MT. With his salary he is able to support his family and save a little bit to use in times of crisis.\r\n\r\nJorge has received loans from other institutions that operate in the area. The first loan was for 2,000.00MT and the second was for 3,000.00MT and were both taken out as group loans. He says that he first learned about Hluvuku-Adsema through colleagues and friends after  he opened offices in this part of the Maputo province. He likes Hluvuku-Adsema because he can take out personal loans (as opposed to group loans) of relatively larger amounts. He has previously taken out loans of 5,200.00 MT and 7,800.00MT. This will be his third loan with Hluvuku-Adsema and his first with Kiva with the amount being 10,000.00MT. Jorge is building his house in phases and hopes to complete construction soon so that he can realize his dream of opening a mini market with various products.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Her dreams of graduating early from high school were interrupted when she was in 6th grade, due to her parents' financial difficulties.  She is the mother of 3 kids, the two oldest being already in school (in the photo, she appears with her youngest). In 2001, she moved with her family from Maputo, where they had been renting, to Campoane, periphery of Boane, where they were able to buy a place, and where they have, since, gradually been building their house.\n\nSince Zina doesn't work, her husband supports their family (including Zina's brother, who lives with them) with a monthly salary of 4,000.00 MT. This is the first time she's applied for a  loan, which she hopes to repay without difficulty. She will use the 18000,00 MT to finish her house, and when this loan is paid in full, she plans to apply for others, to start a grocery store and help improve the family's income.\n\n<br

Her oldest son, now 17, is enrolled in High School, in Boane.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe moved from Vilanculos to Maputo when her sister found her a job in the neighborhood of Chamanculo, where she worked for a year before marrying her husband and moving to Matola. They have been in Matola, where they own their own place, for the past 24 years.\r\n\r\nAfter the General Peace Treaty was signed, in 1992 [ending Mozambique's 16-year civil war between the ruling party and the opposition], Rosa started a business of buying and selling, among other things, blankets and bedspreads--buying them in South Africa  and reselling in Matola for profit. Her daily income varies from 2.000.00 and 2.300,00 MT. She has been in this business, which she  runs by herself, for 19 years.\r\n\r\nRosa heard about Hluvuku through friends. This is her second loan with Hluvuku, and the first with Kiva (she's never had loans with other institutions). These 18.000,00 MT will allow her to buy more blankets to answer the increase in demand during the upcoming winter months. She anticipates paying her loan back without difficulties, and plans to take other loans out in the future, to continue improving her business as well as to start a hair salon and build another house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva

La idea surgi\u00f3 del consumo de sus propios hijos, y al contar con una refrigeradora dej\u00f3 de hacerlo s\u00f3lo para su familia y empez\u00f3 a elaborar en mayor cantidad para emprender este negocio. Todas las tardes elabora los chupetes que deja congelando hasta el d\u00eda siguiente, con el tiempo se ha implementado de diversos moldes y otra nevera, as\u00ed como gran cantidad de barquillos para los helados, los cuales prepara hasta las 11 de la ma\u00f1ana, y luego sale a repartir sus productos a las escuelas cercanas a su casa. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con algunas personas que le ayudan a vender, a quienes les paga por ello. La \u00e9poca m\u00e1s rentable es durantes los meses de verano, sin embargo, como en su regi\u00f3n hay un fuerte sol durante el d\u00eda, sus ganancias se mantienen estables, lo que ha convertido a este negocio en un sost\u00e9n econ\u00f3mico muy importante para la familia. Sus planes para el futuro son de mejorar los utensilios y el equipo que utiliza para tener una mayor producci\u00f3n y de mejor calidad. Es la tercera vez que Josefina tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, ella es una de las socias m\u00e1s activas de su banco comunal y ahora renueva su compromiso de seguir trabajando en equipo y de manera responsable con sus pagos.

","en":"Josefina is 55 years old and lives with her husband and 2 children in their own home. Along with her husband they have been making home made popsicles and ice cream for the last 6 years. They had the idea to start this business when they saw how much their kids enjoyed their popsicles, so since they had a  freezer they just began to make them in larger quantities to undertake this business. She makes the popsicles every afternoon and lets them freeze until next day. Over  the time she has acquired various popsicle molds, another freezer, and a large number of waffle cones for the ice cream.\r\n<p>\r\nShe makes ice cream until 11am and then goes to distribute their products to schools near her home.  She hires some people to help to sell the products, and pays them for their job. The most profitable time is during the summer, however, because in her region they get a strong sun during the day most of the year, her earnings are stable.

She has been selling clothes for one year.  \r\n\r\nThe way she works is to visit her neighbors\u2019 and friends\u2019 houses and offer her garments.  Then, she charges on credit; that way she earns more with weekly or daily payments.  \r\n\r\nEach month Zoraida travels to another city to stock her merchandise.

Anne-Marie was born in 1953 in Ouidah, a historic town in B\u00e9nin in the Atlantique Department. Anne-Marie is a widow and the mother of one child who went to school. She learned from childhood how to sell fresh tomatoes. After her marriage, Anne-Marie went out on her own in that same business for a short time.

Having fully repaid their first four loans, they are now on their fifth farming loan.\r\nThe current loan will be used to buy peanut seeds and small items of farm equipment and fertilizer at the main market in Koutiala. At the end of the off-season, the harvested crops are placed in storage for a certain period to gain value before being sold at the main market of Koutiala and surrounding markets at retail (and often wholesale) prices. The produce is sold for cash to customers who generally come from the large towns.\r\nOnce their agricultural produce has been sold, the members of the W\u00e9dayamana 3 Group each expect to make a profit of CFA 70,000, which will be used to repay the loan interest and cover everyday family expenses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":334728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertlizer, seeds and small items of farm equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ami Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mawa Bourama  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"S\u00e9tou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou  Moussa  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karia Bakassoum ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou  Soungalo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mawa Gnoro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Raba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djen\u00e8ba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":675000,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":675000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":114866,"name":"Ho\u00e0ng Di\u1ec7u","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"H.

To make a living, H. owns and operates a business in the food sector running a food stall. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of food products in the local community. H. has been engaged in this business for over nine years and earns approximately 5,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, H. joined Kiva partner, TYM Fund, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000,000 VND from TYM Fund. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. H. is now requesting a new loan of 20,000,000 VND, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. The loan will be the fifth loan she has taken out from TYM Fund. H. plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":334735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To

Having fully repaid their first four loans, they are now on their fifth farming loan.\r\nThe current loan will be used to buy sufficient quantity of peanut seeds and small items of farm equipment and fertilizer at the main market in Koutiala. At the end of the off-season, the harvested crops are placed in storage for a certain period to gain value before being sold at the main market of Koutiala and surrounding markets at retail (and often wholesale) prices. The produce is sold for cash to customers who generally come from the large towns.\r\nOnce their agricultural produce has been sold, the members of the W\u00e9dayamana 4 Group each expect to make a profit of CFA 65,000, which will be used to repay the loan interest and cover everyday family expenses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":334745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy seeds, fertilizer and small items of farm equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa Soungalo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta Lassina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata Stapha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diarra Hassim ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nounmousso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimata  Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8ba  Karamoko","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamin\u00e8 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amadou Moyama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiaratou Guedouma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":520000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":520000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":114874,"name":"Cao Th\u1ecb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"V.

After four years, she felt secure in her business and left the Committee to receive individual credit. \r\n\r\nToday, Basila\u2019s plastics shop is filled with a wide range of goods and she is happy to service a large clientele. Her daughter often works with her and her son owns his own electronics shop in the center of the city. Although her work has long hours and isn\u2019t easy, she is proud to own her shop and has aspirations to continue to make her business better.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":334935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase more merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ciudad del Este","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.516667 -54.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2009-06-11T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5000000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":555555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":558888.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63177376,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":558888.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602779,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":558888.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038892,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:00:16Z","rounded_local_amount":558888.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96951371,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:38:46Z","rounded_local_amount":558888.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103793475,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":558888.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110684249,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-17T09:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":558888.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118078858,"comment":null},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:11:18Z","rounded_local_amount":558888.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123915039,"comment":null},{"amount":111.12,"local_amount":555555.52,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":558888.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128950756,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-24T19:01:57Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":114908,"name":"Gustavo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gustavo has been a carpenter for 20 years after learning the basic skills from his brother-in-law.

This is how he earns a living and feeds his family.\r\n\r\nRakhim, our longtime client, has been a borrower with us since 2002. During this period, Rakhim took out loans to expand his business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a 27-year-old man who lives in Bourj El Barajneh, in the southern suburbs of Lebanon with his wife and their two children.\r\n\r\nHasan has owned a scrap metal business since 1998. He requested a loan of $800 from Al Majmoua in order to purchase more scrap metal and also some items for the new baby.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

the past ten years, M. Sherzot has put much effort into his agricultural activities. He learned this humble work from his father. His father taught him everything about farming so that, when he had his own family, he could support his wife as well as his children.\r\n\r\nNow, Sherzot is busy preparing his farm for their next planting. Sherzot, the father of two small children, says his wish is that he will again have an abundant harvest. He would like to ask for a loan of 1,000 Somoni that will be used for purchasing fertilizers, herbicides and ammonium sulfate. Sherzot is sure that the loan will help him improve his harvest and he thanks everyone who supports him with this loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In order to make these winter shoes, sheep wool needs to be collected and processed specifically for making shoes. He usually purchases sheep wool in the fall, when prices are low and starts making the shoes before winter. Since these shoes are only used during the winter, the business is quite seasonal. In the future, he hopes to have small machinery that can process wool much more efficiently than his manual handling. Since his oldest son was not able to go to college due to his illness, he has high hopes for his daughters to be well educated. He aims to save some of his business profit for the daughters\u2019 tuitions in the near future. \r\nUurtsayh requests a loan to purchase sheep's wool for this

Because \u201cSunshine\u201d does not have enough cash assets, all of the workers work for free and hope to be paid a salary when better times come. Nowadays, the retirement home exists only with the aid of the retiree\u2019s pensions.<\/P> \r\n\r\n<P>Tatiana hopes to use loan money to purchase a cow and two sheep. Milk and meat from the livestock will be used for cooking. Also, some amount of milk and meat can be sold in the market. Additional food and all the necessary materials will be purchased.

She lives with her husband Jos\u00e9, who is 31 years old, and their three children in a house that they inherited from her parents.  Their children, the reason for all their efforts, are ten-year-old Victor, six-year-old Yenifer, and two-year-old Jos\u00e9.  All her life Yolanda has worked hard to succeed.  She has a shoe store in her neighborhood, which is very popular with her customers.  She serves her customers attentively and is cheerful in the store.  She very much enjoys conversing with customers and being informed of neighborhood news. She does not, however, enjoy spending the entire day in the store and enduring the cold temperature.  Of course, her work demands that she be present all day and not leave for even a few minutes.  She has done this work for five years and yearns for her store to become one of the best-known in Juliaca, but she knows that she must work hard to achieve this.  This is her fifth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma; she feels happy to be given this opportunity and agrees to make all her payments on time.  At her community bank, she is very well-liked because of the responsibility she demonstrates.  With the $1,000 requested, she will buy more shoes to improve her store and offer greater variety to her customers.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":335665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-13T20:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:16Z","rounded_local_amount":500.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990771,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":500.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211880,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":500.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641407,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":500.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080846,"comment":null},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:19Z","rounded_local_amount":500.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996987,"comment":null},{"amount":166.65,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":500.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842326,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-20T09:55:35Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":115107,"name":"Maria Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

She has been selling <i>beignets<\/i> since 2001 in an outlying district of Kinshasa.  Her loyal customers are mainly children and adolescents.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, her initial capital was $1, which she multiplied through her efforts, correct management, and accumulated profits, all of which gained her $90 in capital in 2003.  From 2003-2008, Marie still worked a lot to attain $180 in capital.  She then started to receive loans from HOPE that she repaid completely.  Given the growing number of customers she has, Marie used the loans obtained last May for buying: a sack of wheat flour, a 25-liter drum of vegetable oil, a sack of sugar, and a container of leavening in order to satisfy the demand and also to grow her profits.  \r\n\r\nMarie is 36 years old, married, and the mother of son, age 20, who is a student.
