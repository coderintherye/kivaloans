He resupplies his business every two days and he needs capital to maintain his business funds and continue to update and modernize the merchandise he sells. This is his second loan and is applying for a loan of 1,300,000 Colombian Pesos because he buys the sportswear wholesale. His previous loan helped increase his income because he work capital increased.\r\n\r\nAntonio Jos\u00e9 dreams of having his own sportswear sewing shop and finishing improvements on his home and further in the future buying his own vehicle. These are the challenges he is facing.  \r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King, Kiva

He lives with his wife, who works in the home, and his two small daughters, 4 and 6 years old respectively, who are both studying. Pedro is a hard-working man who puts for a great effort to provide for his family and improve his life. He works selling bottled water, juices, and sodas, which he sells in the heavily trafficked areas in the center of Soyapango. During the course of the day Pedro sells in different locations like the areas outside of malls, markets, and high schools depending on the best time to sell his products. Pedro is applying for the loan in order to buy the products he sells wholesale as well as a cooler big enough to put all his drinks inside and ice. Even though Pedro has a very humble job he is able to earn enough to support his family. This is why he works so hard moving from location to location in order to earn more money and provide for his family.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King, Kiva

They were brought together by their mutual affinity. On average, they are 45-years old and have at least 3 children each. The group\u2019s primary activity is the retail sale of various items such as fish products, apparel, cosmetics and food, and ice cream for those with a refrigerator. The new funding will allow the solidarity group to strengthen and diversify their economic activities.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hawa D. is the president of the group. She is at the far right of the picture in a black dress with gold trim at the waist and the sleeves, holding her bank book. Mrs. D. is 43 years of age, married and the mother of 3 children (ages 15, 11 and 7). She plays a critical role in the group, strengthening the solidarity between its members. She has a shop in front of a school where she sells beverages and beignets. Her loan allows her to bolster her small business and to build a loyal client base consisting mostly of school children. Her goal is to increase her profits and contribute to the improvement of her family\u2019s living conditions with food as well as healthcare and schooling for the children. She would also like to turn her little shop into a large refreshment bar.        \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":551763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Strengthen the economic initiatives of the solidarity group","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Agence de Diourbel","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2010-06-15T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ya Anta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Astou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maguette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gnilane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mame Birame ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Codou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Penda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":795000,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":795000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1450,"local_amount":795000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-16T09:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":795425.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652479,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T03:03:50Z","paid_date":"2011-01-16T09:46:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":206569,"name":"Mario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mario, de 34 a\u00f1os de edad, convive con su pareja y sus dos hijos.

They live together in a community located in the jungles of Cuzco, where they have their own wooden house.  She learned to work when she was very young and when she became pregnant, she continued working because she wanted to give her first child a better life and because she had the support of her family.  For the next three years, she worked for her father and learned the techniques for planting and harvesting.  As such, after some time, her father gave her a small plot so that she could farm and produce her own cacao and coffee, but her earnings were only enough to cover some of her family's basic necessities.  Nowadays, she has a grocery store and also continues to sell her agricultural products.  She sells her items from her home and mostly relies on the help of her children.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for breeding. Jovelyn has been engaged in her business for more than eight years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jovelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Jovelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Jovelyn is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Jovelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Lerma G. is a very simple and well-mannered woman. She dreams of having a life that is plain and peaceful along with her very loving and supportive husband and children.\r\n\r\nWithout much in the way of educational achievements and exposure to other people, Lerma was shy and reserved. However, to raise her children well and have them attain a college degree, she tried to overcome her inferiority complex. Her husband supports all her endeavors to develop her self-confidence.\r\n\r\nAside from dreaming of having her own business to augment the income of her husband as a technician in the Department of Agriculture, Lerma also dreams of seeing herself making friends with other women in their village and wishes to become an inspiration to her fellow poor mothers.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, Lerma joined ASHI and received a loan. It was the first time she joined an institution and she felt excited receiving the loan she requested. With that loan, and succeeding loans she received, the hog-fattening and hog-breeding business she put up with the support of her husband has grown bigger.\r\n\r\nThey became known to people in town and from other towns because of the good quality of the piglets they breed for selling. They also have a boar-for-hire business which is managed by Lerma\u2019s husband and her youngest son. With that business, Lerma has been able to have a cash flow for the education of her children.\r\n\r\nLerma was inspired to work really hard because she saw a lot of potential in her children and they were very determined to have a college degree. Now all of them have their own families to support, yet Lerma is very happy because they have all graduated from college. At least now, she can focus to making her business stable and put up a savings fund for her and her husband\u2019s old age. She doesn\u2019t want to bother her children anymore about their financial needs because she understands that they have their own lives to take care of.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":955.5,"image":{"id":551902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

Vei V. is a 45-year-old farmer who lives in a rural area of Siem Reap Province. She is married to Sim Song, age 45.

Conchita is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Conchita from ASKI.

R., 59, is from the town of Fugu Jones. She is married and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, Teresita owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP whenever she sells her raised animal.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

B., 46, is from the town of Fugu Jones. She is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Mercedita owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Mercedita has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Mercedita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mercedita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. Mercedita is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Mercedita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

To make a living, Maribel owns & operates a business raising pigs for fattening and sale. Maribel has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP when she sells her raised animal.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maribel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maribel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future. Maribel is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Maribel from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 53 and her husband works as a builder. They have a son who is 22 and he works in construction, too.\r\n\r\nAzizahon has been cultivating fruits and vegetables and breeding cattle for twenty-one years. When the other members of the family are free, they help her with these activities. By selling some fruits and vegetables, and sometimes cattle, she makes 2,500 soms (approximately 54 USD) per month. Now she wants to obtain a loan to purchase more farm animals for breeding and fattening. In the future, she plans to build a new house and purchase a vehicle.\r\n\r\nNazhimidin M. is 52 and has two sons and a daughter: his daughter works as a teacher at the school; his older son works in construction; and the second son went to Russia to work to make some money. Nazhimidin and his wife breed cattle; they started this activity twenty years ago with the initial investment of 1,800 soms (approximately 39 USD) and now, by selling some cattle after fattening, they make 2,500 soms (approximately 54 USD) a month. Nazhimidin applied for the loan, because he needs money to purchase a bull-calf for breeding. In the future he plans to build a new house and purchase a vehicle.\r\n\r\nSobirahon M. is 49 and her husband works as a private driver. They have two daughters and a son: the older son went to Russia to work to make some money and the daughters are students. Seventeen years ago, with the initial investment of 4,500 soms (approximately 97 USD), Sobirahon bought cattle and, from that time, she started to breed and sell them after fattening. In this way she makes 3,000 soms (approximately 65 USD) per month. With the money received from this loan, Sobirahon wants to purchase a cow for breeding.\r\n\r\nHolidahon A. is 25 and is the treasurer of the group. Her husband works as a baker and they have a daughter and a son, both of whom go to school. Holidahon has a piece of land where she cultivates potatoes, rice and corn. With the money received from the loan she wants to pay for tractor services and buy fertilizer for her farm. In the future, Holidahon plans to open a kiosk and sell convenience goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Her husband is Silvio C. Coca, and together they have two daughters who are attending a university in the city of Cochabamba. Both are studying for a career in livestock farming. In their free time, the daughters help their mom and dad care for their cows.\r\n\r\nElsa lives in the area known as Maica Chica in Cochabamba; this is where she keeps her cows and sells their milk to a company that produces various types of dairy products. She is seeking a loan for the purchase of one more dairy cow.\r\n\r\nElsa has already had three loans with our institution and demonstrated that she is a very hard-working and responsible person. Furthermore, in the time since her first loan she was able to double the production of milk and the headcount of her cow herd. \r\n\r\nElsa's biggest dream is to see her daughters grow up to become good professionals so that they could have a life that is better than the one she had.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrei Vazhnov, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":552148,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Purchase of a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-06-14T03:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151872826,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159612864,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166827152,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:54:06Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172093471,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177385277,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182523331,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188657833,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191401084,"comment":null},{"amount":400,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195819408,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T05:45:17Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:33:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":206799,"name":"Bendia Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice Q., who is holding the sign, is the leader of a group of five borrowers called \"Bendia\".

Garc\u00eda is a hardworking farmer who is dedicated to growing crops and raising animals.  Lately most of his income has come from selling pork and seasonal agricultural products such as corn, cassava, and yams since these items have stable demand.

They are married and have their own families.  His greatest wish is to keep his business growing.  He plans to buy pork in large quantities and then sell his product to other businesses at a good price.  In addition, he wants to move his family forward, especially the grandchildren who are under his care.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":552253,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase pig\u2019s feet, avocados, yams, and other products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-06-14T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nestor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":115855},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":121398},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":123725},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":126096},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":128513},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":130976},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":133486},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":136045},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":138652},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":145254}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.03},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.24},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.47},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.73},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.01},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.31},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.99},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60.16,"local_amount":115855,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:38Z","rounded_local_amount":117940.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895879,"comment":null},{"amount":63.03,"local_amount":121398,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":123583.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636225,"comment":null},{"amount":64.24,"local_amount":123725,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":125952.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850320,"comment":null},{"amount":65.47,"local_amount":126096,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":128366.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117078,"comment":null},{"amount":66.73,"local_amount":128513,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":130826.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410945,"comment":null},{"amount":68.01,"local_amount":130976,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":133334.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550604,"comment":null},{"amount":69.31,"local_amount":133486,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":135889.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688206,"comment":null},{"amount":70.64,"local_amount":136045,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-18T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":138494.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427440,"comment":null},{"amount":71.99,"local_amount":138652,"processed_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":141148.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000858,"comment":null},{"amount":75.42,"local_amount":145254,"processed_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":147869.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288865,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-21T00:03:29Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":206843,"name":"Nataliya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nataliya is a married mother with a 5-year-old child.

This group is made up of thirteen members who live in the city of Temuco. Their businesses are: a dessert shop, sewing, a hair salon, food preparation, clothing sales, hardware store, and Internet center.\r\n\r\nThe group member interviewed for this borrower profile is Olga, who is the group\u2019s treasurer. In the photo, Olgo is pictured in the second row, standing to the left, with shoulder-length hair and bangs.\r\n\r\nOlga\u2019s business is a dessert shop: she primarily makes chocolate lollipops, cookies, and fruit tarts. She also fills special orders for cakes and other desserts. She has a number of regular clients among the people she knows, and through them she makes contact with other clients.\r\n\r\nOlga plans to invest this loan in materials and ingredients to prepare her desserts, particularly using a wider variety of figure molds to make her chocolates.\r\n\r\nOlga\u2019s dream is to have her business in an established locale in the center of the city, because this would bring her more clients. Her greatest motivation is her family, especially her 16-year-old son who hopes to attend university in two years.\r\n\r\nWhat Olga has enjoyed most about working with Fondo Esperanza have been the workshops that focus on \u201cautoconocimiento\u201d, or self-awareness, because through these she has been able to discover her weaknesses and her strengths and to identify how to overcome the former and maximize the latter. She also very much enjoys her contact with the other group members, and how quickly she was able to get her loan through Fondo Esperanza.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. It is located 670 kilometers south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lake-side spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile's existing indigenous Mapuche community lives, some of whom are members of Fondo Esperanza communal banks.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3150,"image":{"id":552333,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy materials and ingredients to prepare her desserts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Temuco","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2010-06-17T12:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marianella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Ximena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1714769,"loan_amount":3150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102043},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":102707},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":103371},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":104048},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":104722},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":105399},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":106086},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106776},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":107475},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":108175},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":108875},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109585},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":110297},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":111020},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":111743},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":112447}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.14},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.15},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.01},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.3},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.27},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":566.01,"local_amount":308121,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":310288.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151890334,"comment":null},{"amount":772,"local_amount":420255,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":423210.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159630717,"comment":null},{"amount":792.3,"local_amount":431301,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":434334.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166844768,"comment":null},{"amount":1019.69,"local_amount":555092,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":558996.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172110944,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-18T05:34:53Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:03:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":206864,"name":"Clara","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Clara, de 30 a\u00f1os vive con su esposo Juan y sus 4 hijos, en la vivienda de sus suegros, ubicado en la ciudad de Tarma, ya que sus hijos tienen mayores oportunidades acad\u00e9micas.

","en":"Gloria is 44 years old and lives in her own home with her husband Florentio (age 55) and three of their five children.  The older children work and live independently.  Gloria grows potatoes of different varieties since the place where she is lives is located in high altitude.  She only produces tubers and provides them great care, which is why she is considered one of the best producers of this product.  To ensure that her harvest is successful, she always works together with her husband.  Gloria also raises animals such as sheep, cows, horses, and pigs and sells them as needed based on her financial needs.  What she enjoys most is raising her crops and taking care of her animals by allowing them to feed on green pastures.  She considers her work to be very profitable and wants to continue farming in the future, but in larger quantities so that she can enjoy greater income.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.

Cuando decidieron hacer una vida en com\u00fan, valoraron el aprendizaje que le dieron sus padres, adem\u00e1s porque estos frutos son los que mejor producen en esta zona de la Selva Central del Per\u00fa. Cada ma\u00f1ana de manera ordenada Digmar, sale a limpiar y cuidar sus cultivos, porque sabe que la recompensa de su ardua labor vendr\u00e1 en la cosecha. \u00c9l confiesa que le fascina ver sus plantaciones fuertes, sin maleza que interrumpa su crecimiento. Su mayor anhelo es que sus hijos puedan estudiar una carrera profesional en la ciudad y no dependan de las labores agr\u00edcolas solamente, a pesar de ser muy rentable. Por el momento desea aumentar la cantidad de plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y naranjas que tiene. Este es el segundo cr\u00e9dito con MFP y como presidente de la junta directiva de su grupo, es quien hace cumplir las normas y reglas de su grupo comunal, para que todo marche muy bien como hasta ahora.

He is 35 years old and lives very happily in his own house with his wife Enafilia, who is 34, and their two small children, who are his motivation to work hard everyday.\r\n\r\nWith his wife, he grows coconuts, bananas, coffee, corn, cassava and citrus fruits on fertile land that he owns.  When Digmar and Enafilia decided to make a life together, they chose these crops because they valued the teaching his parents gave him, and also because these crops are the ones that grow best in this zone of Peru's Central Jungle.  Every morning, according to his routine, Digmar goes out to weed and take care of his crops because he knows the payment for his hard work will come in the harvest.  He confesses that it fascinates him to see his plants grow strong, without any disease that interrupts their growth.  His greatest desire is for his children to be able to study a professional career in the city and not depend on agricultural work, despite its being very profitable.  For the moment he wants to increase the number of coffee fields and orange fields that he has.\r\n\r\nThis is Digmar's second loan with MFP, and as president of the board of directors of his group, he is the one to makes his communal bank follow its rules.  For this reason everything has gone very well until now.  With the loan he is requesting, Digmar will buy various work tools like machetes and crates.

Nevertheless, transporting his heavy goods in winter is very difficult because the Perene River floods its banks and can only be crossed by boat, since there is no bridge. He attests that his work is profitable, as in his 14 years as a farmer he has never wanted for food. Instead, it has enabled him to provide very well for his children.

He lives in his own house with two of his four children.  He has been separated from his wife for three years, although he is still dependent on her.  Almost without rest, he works every day in his small farm, in search of a better future for his children, as he continues to support them economically.  It is for this reason he begins his daily work very early, in which he has extensive hectares where he produces coffee, bananas, citrus fruits, cocoa, and annatto (makes a red paste used in cooking for color and flavor).\r\n<p>\r\nOn occasion he receives the help of his son, who carefully inspects the plants.  What Roberto likes most is to pull out the weeds from his farm and likewise keep them clean.  Also he likes to put traps out so that the animals don't spoil his harvests, and he can sell them at good prices in the market in his city.  The fruits that he produces are highly demanded and as such, he considers his business very profitable.  Going forward, he wants to be one of the biggest producers of cocoa, bananas and coffee in order to be able to earn greater profits.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP and he is sure that he can complete each payment punctually, as he did with his first loan.

The members of this bank meet every 15 days, and the majority of them live in the neighborhood where they meet. Vilma has had a dressmaking business for 5 years, and she enjoys this work very much.  She also sells Avon products to her customers from her home.  She is married and has 4 married children.  She is a grandmother, and her husband works as a driver. Vilma has been taking loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n for 7 years, and it is going very well. With this new loan she will be able to invest in her businesses.  She always divides her loans by purchasing Avon products as well as fabric, thread, fasteners, buttons and lace.  She sells her beauty products without leaving the house; when her orders arrive she calls her customers and they come to get the products, so she can dedicate her time to sewing.  When she has to deliver her garments, her daughter-in-laws help her with the household tasks, which is a great help, and this way she can deliver her garments to her customers on time.  She tells us that the best month for her business is December.  She buys her products with cash, and she allows her customers credit in 2 or 3 payments.  She has never gotten behind in her payments to the fundaci\u00f3n, where she is considered to be a very responsible person who is dedicated to her work.  Her dream is to be able to make some repairs to her house which are needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlenda has been a member of the communal bank \"Francisco Pacheco\" for 3 years, and she is doing very well with the loans that she has received.  She is married and has 2 children.  She maintains a very stable and happy home.  Her activity is the sale of Yanbal beauty products; she has been doing this work for 5 years.  She also maintains a business with her husband selling household utensils, which they have had for 7 years.  Glenda, along with her husband, has made progress with her businesses.  When they started to sell household utensils it was not going well because they did not know how to manage their sales; many of the customers were unreliable and never paid them, but they were not defeated.  They continued on, learning, and after a while it started to go better.  At this moment they have an established business that is well-stocked with household appliances such as: TVs, refrigerators, and other items.  They deliver all of these appliances door to door, and extend credit at payments that go from 1 to 10 dollars a week.  Her husband is in charge of making the collections, and their business has expanded to various cantons in the province such as Tosagua, 24 De Mayo, Jipijapa, and others.  They have had approximately 5,000 customers over the 7 years that they have run this business.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan that she is requesting from the Fundaci\u00f3n, Glenda will use part of the loan to buy beauty products such as makeup and perfumes, and with the other part she will buy cooking utensils and appliances.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ruby joined ASHI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. With the chance given to her family by ASHI, a KIVA partner, the couple believes they are getting closer to the achievement of their family dreams. Her long -term goals are to build a profitable business, send her two children to college, and invest in her home.  With the support of Kiva lenders, Ruby is committed to continue her enterprise and determined to achieve economic stability for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":552494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Bella owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Ma. Bella has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nMa. Bella joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ma. Bella has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Ma. Bella is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the second loan taken out by Ma. Bella from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.  Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines.  In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring.

She was very poor when she joined the institution; however, having a wealth of dreams, she eventually climbed out of poverty a little bit. Loans she received from ASHI were used wisely, to finance a business she could manage and enjoy. As the years have gone by and the loan amounts she is qualified to receive have grown larger, the variety and volume of inventory in Lilymar\u2019s small \u201csari-sari\u201d store has also increased. Now, her store is not just a typical sari-sari, which means a shop with a few selected grocery items, including some foodstuff and beverages, but it\u2019s a bit of a mini grocery store that has a larger volume of various kinds of products. \r\n<p>\r\nSustaining a business--especially for a woman who had not undergone any informal training on managing a business and cash flow--is very challenging. For Lilymar, the inspiration of graduating her three children from college and supporting their needs until they can manage their own lives encourages her to become more productive. Her bitter childhood experiences, living a very poor kind of life until she had her own family, drive her inner self to aim for more business. This way, she can make her children\u2019s lives much better.\r\n<p>\r\nAside from her sari-sari store business, Lilymar used some of the loans she received from ASHI to purchase tricycles (motorcycles with sidecar), one for a transportation business to be managed by her husband, and the other one for hire. Because Lilymar realized that the income from this business is higher and more stable than that from her store, she and her husband decided to purchase another one, which will also be for hire.

His original profession is teaching the Koran. After some years of being a teacher, Mr. B. has decided to switch to photography and video recording, something he had been doing as a side activity before. With over 20 years of experience, he is very much in demand and enjoys a good reputation thanks to the high quality of his recordings, mostly  taken during weddings, christenings, birthday parties and so on. He has his own studio in Hamdallaye near the Tieba military base. In order to keep his business going and to better meet the customer demand, about two years ago he decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. He is now on his second individual loan, having duly repaid his earlier loan. The second loan will allow him to purchase a new camera, photo film, blank video tapes, batteries etc. His goal is to reach an average monthly  income of 95,000 West African Francs, which will be used essentially to increase his business capital, contribute to the family budget and pay off the interest on his loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":552614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","use":"Purchasing a photo camera and accessories (film, blank tapes, batteries etc)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-11T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ousmane ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":25106.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699747,"comment":null},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":25106.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913648,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":25106.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180786,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":25106.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476753,"comment":null},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25106.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613463,"comment":null},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":25106.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751899,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-06-11T23:31:22Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":207007,"name":"Ng\u00f4's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T.

That\u2019s what diligent and affable 30-year-old N. Aisha has found out in her ten years experience running her business. She has, for the most part, been selling cassava, bananas and potatoes.\r\n\r\nAisha\u2019s business in Amber Court market, Jinja, has had its fair share of troubles but Aisha has not buckled under the pressure, knowing what is at stake in reference to her family\u2019s welfare. She has five children to take care of and all her children are in school, though at first glance, her paltry profits of 45,000 shillings a week would make one think she is incapable of handling her family tasks.\r\n\r\nAisha was introduced to her business by a close friend and, like any other business, the start was tough as Aisha did not have sufficient capital to buy all the crops she wanted to sell. With a decade's experience behind her, Aisha's optimism is sky high.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.
