He is married to Rosanna, a housewife and mother to their children. He, together with his wife, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRodel operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. Aside from the store, he has a small videoke machine at home. A videoke is a combined term for video karaoke. \r\n\r\nRodel earns his income by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece in his store; having his videoke machines for rent; and putting up a small area of his house as a small videoke area where people can hang out and sing. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 268 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a 27,000 PHP loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory, and for maintenance of his videoke machines. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nRodel hopes to be able to expand soon, just as he hopes to support his children's schooling up to college level.

He doesn't have enough cash on hand to get them.\r\n\r\nMhamad opened his own shop in 2007, but he has 10 years of experience in this field which gives him a positive point and his customers trust him.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to expand his business further and to have employees to help in doing quarterly maintenance for customers.\r\n  "}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1494,"image":{"id":797157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Air Conditioning","sector":"Services","use":"To buy air conditioners necessary for his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Qana","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2011-06-22T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mhamad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":174}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":332,"local_amount":332,"processed_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":332,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221603638,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T07:51:13Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226973065,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-17T07:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232731179,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-18T09:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238534714,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-30T08:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244494238,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-19T08:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250702339,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-18T08:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257299279,"comment":null},{"amount":166,"local_amount":166,"processed_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:19:04Z","rounded_local_amount":166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317273,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-09T16:21:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":309596,"name":"Gelasia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gelasia is 60 years old and is a married woman with 12 children.

Kyrgyzstan). She is the mother of five children\u2014two sons and three daughters. She is married and lives with her eldest son, daughter-in-law and grandson.\r\n\r\nTursun was born into a simple farm family. Since childhood she helped her mother on the farm and like to do housework.  After leaving school, she started work on the local collective farm as a milkmaid. In 1971, four years after graduating, Tursun married. In the beginning, she and her husband lived with his parents in Sosnovka village (in the Zhaiylsky area of Chuysky, Kyrgyzstan).  Her husband worked on a local collective farm, and Tursun looked after their household. Soon the collective farm where Tursun\u2019s husband worked allocated them a plot of land in order to build a home.  Within three years, Tursun\u2019s husband built a house, and after the birth of their first child (a daughter), they have moved away from his parents. They did not get a farm all at once.  In due course, they acquired a calf and on ground allocated by the state they began to grow clover and barley.  After a time, Tursun found work at a local cotton mill as a weaver, where she has worked more than twenty years.  In due course, the family grew, as did the farm, which was expanded after the sale of some cattle at the market.  In 2008 Tursun purchased a shop in the Bishkek \u2013 Osh road, and started to sell groceries.  She is helped by her younger son and daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\nNow on Tursun\u2019s farm there is one milk cow, one calf, two horses and twelve sheep. Tursun has applied to  Bai-Tushum  and Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to increase her livestock.  With her income, she plans to further expand the farm and to open a new shop.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and investors.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":797206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sosnovka village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-06-21T16:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tursun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-06-22T23:25:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":309619,"name":"Reth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Reth, 38 years old, is a rice wine producer at her home and her husband is a carpenter.

daughter. Natalia Nikolaevna's family is hardworking and amicable.  The children go to school. Natalia and her spouse raise cattle on their small farm, and they grow vegetables. Now their farm has two milk cows who produce a good amount of milk. In the Moscow area, where Natalia lives, there is a butter factory which produces, not only for the domestic market, but for neighboring countries as well.   Every day Natalia Nikolaevna delivers 20-25 liters of milk to the factory, which means a stable income for the family. Her spouse helps on the farm and also works at Krupskoe village high school as a security guard. Additionally, the family grows tomatoes and peppers, renting 1.5 hectares of land every year.  The produce is then sold in the local market.\r\n\r\nNatalia Nikolaevna has asked Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) with which she plans to buy a milk cow. It will allow her to produce more milk and to increase a production in the future so that she can maintain her farm well.  \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and investors.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is married, with 3 children. He sells various construction materials at the central market in Dushanbe. Said has been in this business for 20 years. He tried selling several types of goods, but then stayed with construction materials.

He finds this loan very helpful for his business development.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It hosted a key post along the Silk Road and marked the extent of Alexander the Great's empire. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sectors, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

an entrepreneur from Kurgantube, Tajikistan where he lives with his wife and three children, has been in the grocery business for 12 years. He is requesting a loan of 5000 TJS to buy foodstuffs in order to generate additional profits. Very good with finances, Makhmadrasul knows how to manage money and make the right investments. We believe the current loan will allow him to maintain a good product selection and continue to earn an adequate income to support himself and his family.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes its role as a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She would like to offer them more variety, and the loan will enable her to purchase more inventory.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":468.72,"image":{"id":797383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"to purchase more merchandise for her small clothing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Caaguaz\u00fa","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2011-06-25T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":2336237,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208130},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213553},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219117},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":224826},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230684},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236694},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":242861},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":249189},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255681},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":255502}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.45},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.27},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.74},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.45,"local_amount":208130,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":213275.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221675633,"comment":null},{"amount":54.85,"local_amount":213553,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":218833.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227044611,"comment":null},{"amount":56.27,"local_amount":219117,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":224534.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232805551,"comment":null},{"amount":57.74,"local_amount":224826,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":230384.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238616649,"comment":null},{"amount":59.25,"local_amount":230684,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":236387.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244570460,"comment":null},{"amount":60.79,"local_amount":236694,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:09:15Z","rounded_local_amount":242546.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250781820,"comment":null},{"amount":62.37,"local_amount":242861,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:22:45Z","rounded_local_amount":248865.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257190327,"comment":null},{"amount":64,"local_amount":249189,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":255350.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263326631,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-02T21:35:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":309771,"name":"Maria Angelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Angelina es madre de 8 ni\u00f1os el mas peque\u00f1o es de 1 a\u00f1o y medio su esposo es alba\u00f1il del municipio,que esta cerca de la capital de Guatemala, ella se dedica a  tejer fajas y asegura que ha sido un  negocio muy rentable adem\u00e1s le ha ayudado a que sus hijos est\u00e9n estudiando es por eso que solicita un cr\u00e9dito mas, y promete ser puntual en los pagos ya que si se le otorgara ayudar\u00eda a invertirlo en hilos y fertilizantes  para sembrar ma\u00edz y frijol en esta \u00e9poca  y eso mismo ayudar\u00eda a que sus hijos puedan seguir estudiando y ser personas de \u00e9xito.","en":"Angelina is the mother of 8 children; the youngest is one-and-a-half years old.

Before that she worked in sewing, but then she started having a problem with her eyes and couldn\u2019t continue sewing, which is why she decided to begin her own business. She is requesting a loan to buy 20-liter bottles so that she can take water to more homes, since sometimes each house will request 2 or 3 bottles of water. Her clients prefer her because the water she sells is a little more economical and cleaner. Also, her business is near their houses and they can have the service of having it brought to their houses. This is the only water purifying business in the town. When she requested the loan, she was content. She is 57 years old, she studied through the third year of secondary school, she is a single mother with 2 sons. She wants this loan so she can have more bottles and sell more water.

Five years ago, Elba looked for a way to supplement the family income so she decided to raise pigs.  She buys the animals when they are small so that she can fatten them. Elba raises them for a period of six months before selling them and starting the process over again.  Her business is located in an area behind her house that is well-suited for keeping her pigs.
