The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Such places don't even appear in the Lonely Planet's budget guide, but if you're looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all-local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":205151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more rice, sugar,  salt and cooking oil in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-20T16:50:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary I.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-04T17:27:53Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":104004,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348024,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:54Z","rounded_local_amount":104004,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970607,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":104004,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886824,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":104004,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436084,"comment":null},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":104004,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130357,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-09-20T17:27:53Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":66161,"name":"Rafiou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Rafiou D. est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 38 ans, mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de 2 enfants tous sur les bancs de l\u2019\u00e9cole.

She is married to Thierry AGOSSA, a welder, and is the mother of five children, four of whom are in school.  Currently a retailer of pagnes (colorful West African cloth) and shoes, she has embraced numerous kinds of work in the past.  A hairdresser by profession, she had gotten started very early on selling rice door-to-door.  In December 2006, she came to sign her first loan contract for the amount of 40,000 francs CFA in order to bolster her capital.  With this loan, she realized sufficient savings.  With a plan for commerce in beauty products and, little by little, pagnes purchased at the Dantokpa marketplace, she requested as her third loan the amount of 50,000 francs.  Thanks to her distribution method, she has so far procured many customers and a good foundation in the domain of selling pagnes.

The couple have in their care four children, who are all in school.  Ms. Justine L. has been residing with her husband in the Ay\u00e9lawadj\u00e8 district for almost six months.  She has been selling staple foods for over five years, making sales through a distribution system but also out of the front of her house.  Currently, she has built a shop that will serve as a storehouse and place of business.  She started the aforementioned business around 2003 with start-up funds of 80,000 francs CFA.  Confronted with the problem of inventory and supplies a few months afterwards, she turned to outside financing.  This is why she obtained her first loan on October 25, 2004 in the amount of 50,000 francs, which enabled her to start buying in bulk.  She has come to request as her fifth loan 250,000 francs for acquiring supplies.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Mr. L. is seeking a loan which he will use to install running water, electricity and a bathroom in their home.  He will also cancel some beams that he used for his house, which he has been building little by little with the loans which AFODENIC has granted him.

Her sister has been in Costa Rica for two yeas with her entire family, so she will live alone in the house.  Of the seven loans she has requested, she used one to buy a plot of land, five for the construction of her house, and one for the processing fees for her university degree.  She has worked with AFODENIC since 2001 and feels well taken care of.  The loans have helped her a lot because her teacher\u2019s salary has never allowed her to achieve her hopes of having a dignified home.  She has worked as a teacher at the San Sebastian Institute from 1:00pm until 6:00pm Monday through Friday for the past 8 years.  She suggests that as long as there is work, she will keep investing in improvements to her home so when she succeeds in forming a family, she will already have a dignified home.<br

Johana works at INTAE, and has the responsibility of certification. She is asking for her seventh loan, which she will use to purchase construction materials like stone quarries and iron. Next, she will buy cement and other materials in order to build a room. Johana has demonstrated responsibility and honesty with the loans that she has been granted so far. Moreover, she is known as a worker and helper among her friends.

He also provides financial help to his mother who lives in Inhambane, sending her 500MT each month. In 2005 the school offered him land to build his house, but since he has so many expenses he only built the foundation of the house. He heard about Hluvuku's services through friends and colleagues and decided to request a loan.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva in the amount of 12,000MT to buy construction materials and resume the building of his house. Once he's done repaying this loan he plans to take out additional loans to continue with the construction of the house as he is aware that this first loan will only allow him to begin construction due

Her salon is open from 8am to 7pm.  She learned this trade by being a hair salon employee for two years.  In addition to selling beauty products and services, she sells some basic necessities.  Among these, peanuts sales are big; she sells them for 10 meticais (MZN) per cup (five cups make up one kilogram).  <p>\r\n\r\nMarcela makes 1,500 MZN per day and saves 5,000 MZN per month.

Having worked as a barber in her youth, in 1998 she opened a hair salon in her home and was successful.  In 2006, however, her husband became sick, and she had to spend all their money to treat him.  He did not withstand the illness and lost his life in 2007.  After this tragedy, Leopoldina had no money to continue her business.  With three children to raise and six months pregnant, she counted on just her father\u2019s help.  Three months later she received an indemnity\/benefit payment for her husband\u2019s service.  For her children, she opted to leave the funds in the account for the length of the term because in addition to the original amount, she began to receive a monthly pension of 2,000 meticais (MTn).  With the help of Hluvuku (Kiva\u2019s Field Partner), Leopoldina transformed the old salon into a shop where she sells basic necessities.  She has had positive results and is able to raise her children and to save 2,000 MTn.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  She used the first loan of 15,000 MTn to buy products for her shop, and will use this second loan of 25,000 MTn to do the same.  In the future she intends to ask for more loans to invest in a chicken-selling business.  In the photo Leopoldina appears with her son.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

He is separated and the father of three children, between 1 and 7 years old.  Only the oldest son lives with him.  He moved to Namaacha, a village on the border of Swaziland, in search for work at his cousin\u2019s company.  <P>\r\n\r\nLouren\u00e7o did not have the opportunity to go to school because his father was an alcoholic, and being the oldest child Louren\u00e7o had to work on ranches to feed his siblings.  When he was 13 years old, he left Inhambane for his cousin\u2019s house in Namaacha, where he worked as a domestic servant for two years and earned 350 meticais (MTn) per month.  Then he worked for four months raising chickens for Mr. Tnga, a major chicken farmer in Namaacha, and received 400 MTn per month.  In 1998 he started his own business with the money he had saved from his two years and four months of work.  He sells cakes, bread, and mcel and Vodacom phone cards on the border (between Maputo and Swaziland).  His best products are the phone cards of 15, 45, 74, and 90 MTn, which he sells for 20, 50, 80, and 100 MTn respectively.  He makes 4,000 MTn monthly and is able to save 1,000 MTn per month.  From his work experience Louren\u00e7o has developed a lot.  He was able to build a brick townhouse and will build another house when he is no longer married.  He does not want to live with a new wife in the house he built with his ex-wife with whom he is separated because she contracted a mental disease two years ago.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Louren\u00e7o\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku (Kiva\u2019s Field Partner) and his first with Kiva.  He used the first loan of 10,000 MTn to buy products to resell when he had insufficient funds, on account of his wife\u2019s illness.  He recuperated costs and repaid the loan before the due date.  He will use this second loan of 25,000 MTn for the same purpose.  He is confident that he will be able to repay it and will request another loan to build chicken coops at his house and to raise and sell chickens.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

In addition to her children, she supports a daughter-in-law who lives with her.  <P>\r\n\r\nAlzira grew up with her parents.  She studied through 9th grade and then discontinued her studies because she fell ill.  Besides going to school, she also learned how to sew.  She used to make children\u2019s clothes, an activity which she stopped when she got married in 1989.  Now she lives in her own house.  <P>\r\n\r\nAlzira has been living basically off a business, renting out a commercial space, for three years.  Her store opens at 7:00am and closes at 9:00pm everyday.  She employs one woman.  She learned this business activity from her father-in-law, who is a major businessperson who has several commercial enterprises in the city of Maputo.  <P>\r\n\r\nThe store provides a variety of products, mostly basic groceries.  The highest-margin products are sodas and beer, which she sells for an average of 25 meticais (MTn) per beer and 10MTn per soda.  Her daily sales range from 500MTn to 1500MTn, and she manages to save some money each month.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Alzira\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku (Kiva\u2019s Field Partner) and with Kiva.  Previously she took out loans from other banks in the amount of 5500MTn to start her business.  Now she plans to use this loan to increase her product offerings in order to increase her profits.  Her greatest dream is to build her own commercial space.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

Shahodat is 53 years old. She is married and is the loving mother of five children. Shahodat is a market vendor. She started out eight years ago with only a few products, but her business is currently more stable. Shahodat is selling fruits and vegetables such as: pears, grapes, apples, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Her youngest daughter who is pictured in the photo helps Shahodat with the business. In the market she is known by people because of her attractive prices and friendly nature. All this allows Shahodat\u2019s business to generate a stable and considerable income for her family. Now, her goods are in great demand. For this reason, she is planning to purchase new, fresh fruits and vegetables in order to restock her store, thus expanding her business. For this purpose, she is requesting a loan of $1000, which she will repay in 12 months. She hopes to increase her income in order to pay her children\u2019s university fees. With your help, this will be possible. Shahodat would like to thank everyone for supporting

Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of onL. 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

Hence, she requests a loan of 3,000,000 Riel ($750) to purchase two oxen to use to plow farmland. She hopes the loan will improve her business more than in the previous year and adequately sustain her family's living expenses.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":206035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

J. is 38 years old. She is married and the loving mother of three children. All her children are in school. Bibinazira's husband is a driver and his income is very low; that is why she decided to start her own business so that she could help him cover their living expenses. For more than 10 years she has been selling clothing for children. Bibinazira is a very enthusiastic and dynamic woman. She has very nice taste in picking the clothing she buys and amazing marketing skills in convincing her clients about the clothing they should buy.
