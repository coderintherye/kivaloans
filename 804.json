","en":"Nurinarda is 66 years old and her business is making handicrafts such as backpacks and bags.  She carries out this work every day.  On weekends, she also prepares special food.  She has a 22-year-old son who is studying and it is for him that she is driven to work hard, so that she can make income and improve his well-being.  Nurinarda's daily life consists of caring for children in a 'hogar substituto' (center for vulnerable children) in her home.  This is supported by the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare, an organization that protects children in Colombia.  This makes her some additional income.  In the afternoons, she makes her handicrafts which also earns her income.  She learned this work by family tradition in her home town of San Jacinto and started working in her own business doing this one year ago. \r\n\r\nOn weekends, Nurinarda prepares and sells empanadas, 'pan prensado' (a type of sandwich), desserts and other treats.  She is also well known for this by her neighbors.  Nurinarda's goal is to position herself in her businesses.  She permanently needs working capital to invest so that her number of customers will continue to increase every day.   This is why she is taking out a Kiva loan (her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).

She lives in the city of Cartagena. She is a widow with four children aged 31 to 40 years old. Since her husband died 29 years ago (he had a store in the market where he sold prepared food and groceries), she had to assume responsibility for her children. She closed his business and started to sell various merchandise in the city such as gold and silver jewelry and general clothing. With her business she was able to get her daughters ahead because it went very well for her. This is because of the support she received from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She has received 17 loans from this organization over 14 years. With this support her life has changed a lot. Her business was very small and she only had one, and now she also generates income and jobs with her microbusiness selling fast food. She has display cases and her income has increased, generating a better quality of life for her. Since her clientele is growing, she requires permanent working capital to be able to respond quickly. The working capital she has is now insufficient and that is why she is turning to a Kiva loan, her 18th loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy materials to make her fast food such as sausages, bread, baloney, cheese and other ingredients. She will also invest in merchandise such as gold and silver jewelry to fill orders her customers have made.

She is married to Roberto, and they have been blessed with eight children who are grown up and settled in marriage already.

She has run her business since 1990.  One of her strategies in running her business is changing the products she offers, because it has a great impact in increasing her profit.

Her husband is Carlos, a technician, and she is the mother of one child. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nPaulina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells cooked viands in her store. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nPaulina hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 8000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nArgie hopes her business will grow more in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1022357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-03-10T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-04-09T21:20:04Z","loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Argie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-03-12T02:12:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":400850,"name":"010403-Th\u00f4n Xu\u00e2n Ph\u1ee5-Ho\u1eb1ng Ph\u1ee5-Ho\u1eb1ng Ho\u00e1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Th\u0103ng has a retail business selling\u00a0medicinal herbs.

His wife works as a farmer. Christophe has been a rice farmer for two years. He would like to obtain this Kiva loan to buy fertilizers and seeds, and support labor to get the best harvest. With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to get more output.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

With the profits, he plans to expand the area he has been using to get more output.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

She is married to Edgar, her business partner, and they have three children. With her husband, she manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAna operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. Ana earns a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them individually. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAna hopes to expand her business soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending for agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.
