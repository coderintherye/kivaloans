O. is a 28-year-old tailor who lives in Nyalenda slum in Kisumu and also sells ready-made clothes. Simon is married and has one son, Duncan. He purchases his clothing stock from Nairobi and Busia. Simon does not ascribe fixed prices to his clothes, but, in the tradition of most merchants in Kenya\u2019s markets, negotiates for each item. <P>\r\n\r\nThe challenges, he says, are stiff competition from other sellers and the ups and downs of Kenya\u2019s economy. It is hard to predict when people will have money here. This is Simon\u2019s first loan, and he plans to use it for more clothing stock and, if he can afford it, new sewing machines for tailoring. As an aside, I asked him who his favorite football team is. Breaking with most Kenyans, he said Barcelona FC instead of Manchester United. <P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Simon saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Simon responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end,  you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you\" and Erokamano, which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/ <P>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

A. grew up here in Kisumu and runs a juice and yogurt business. She has her own recipe that she describes in this video. She has two employees who help her distribute the juice by going door to door in town. Beryl is a 28-year-old single mother of two children, aged 6 and 4, who, she says, adore her. The challenges she faces are paying her employees when business is slow.<P>\r\n\r\nIn addition, Beryl says the weather has cooled down here in Kisumu, where the temperature on the day we interviewed her hovered around 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Beryl hopes to use the loan to open up her own canteen where she can serve her juices. This will allow her to stay closer to home while at the same time not having to run her business out of where she lives. She also hopes to employ more people. When asked if men or women make better entrepreneurs, she says women, a common refrain amongst our borrowers. <P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Beryl saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Beryl responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end,  you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you\" and Erokamano, which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/ <P>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

A. is a 26-year-old mother of one boy, named Geoffrey. She runs a salon and also sells both ready-made and used clothes, purchased from Busia or Nairobi. She lives in Nyalenda slum and hopes to use the loan to expand her business. The profits will go to support children orphaned by relatives and by neighbors that have passed away. Her main challenges are stiff competition in the market from other clothes-sellers. <P>\r\n\r\nSusan likes running her own business because no one restricts her and it gives her freedom. Susan\u2019s hopes that in the future she will be able to grow her business so that she can make enough money to support all her children. She is hoping the government will do something for all the orphans she takes care of. <P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Susan saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Susan responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you\" and Erokamano, which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/ <P>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

O. is a 33-year-old mother of three children, ages 14, 10, and 7. All are in school and she is married to a police officer. Christine sells charcoal and sometimes makes dresses. She lives next to Nyamasaria slum near a Coptic church. She purchases the charcoal from trucks (lorries) that come around \u2013 bringing it from forests near Masi Mara. <P>\r\n\r\nChristine also owns six houses that she rents out. She hopes to use the loan to expand her business by purchasing more charcoal to sell. Her hopes for the future are for her business to enlarge and to sell out of a kiosk and maybe even a truck. <P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Christine saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Christine responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you\" and Erokamano, which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/ <P>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

She lives in Nyalenda slum in Kisumu where she raises her eight children. Pamela runs a tailoring shop near her home and averages about ten customers a day. Customers are usually charged around 500 shillings for her services, though Pamela says her main challenge is maintaining a consistent customer base. She will use this loan to buy materials she needs for her business as well as paying school fees for her children. <P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Pamela saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Pamela responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you\" and Erokamano, which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/ <P>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

A. is a 29-year-old who lives in Nyamasaria and sells both used and ready-made clothes. She purchases her clothing stock either in Kibuye market (Kisumu\u2019s largest open-air market) or Nairobi. She chooses the clothes she sells by looking for what her customers like. Sometimes she will see 10 customers, other days 5 and sometimes no customers come. <P>\r\n\r\nFidelite is married and has one son, age 6, named Frank. Frank says that when he grows up, he would like to be a doctor. Fidelite likes running her own business because it means she does not have to ever go begging to her husband. She likes purchasing things on her own instead of waiting for him. She hopes to use this loan to purchase more clothing stock. Her hopes for the future are to expand her business so that one day she will own her own boutique. <P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Fidelite saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Fidelite responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you\" and Erokamano, which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\r\n<P>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

Her husband passed away and she is raising her children by herself. She is a farmer and lives in Kawese, which is just outside of Kisumu to the Northwest. Margret\u2019s main challenge is finding high quality seeds, which she usually purchases from Agrovet in Kisumu.  She wants to use the loan to purchase hybrid seeds and to hire farmhands. She grows vegetables, maize, beans and green grubs. Her hope for the future is to send all her children to school.<P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Margret saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Margret responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you\" and Erokamano, which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/ <P>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

They are both in school. She sells second-hand clothes, purchased at Kibuye market (Kisumu\u2019s largest open-air market) and sells them by going door to door in Nyamasaria. Her challenges are that there are so many other people also selling used clothes. and the wholesalers have raised the price of bales. Christine has thought about starting a new business to sell vegetables from Nakuru in Kibuye. Her hopes for the future are to have a big business, to send her children to university and to own her own home. In her free-time she likes to watch videos and take her children on little tours.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Christine saying \"Idhi Nade\", which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Christine responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"thank you\" and \"Erokamano\", which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in <a href=\"http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post.<\/a>\r\n<p>\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

She sells maize and cosmetics, purchased from Busia, and sold in Nyamasaria slum. Beatrice\u2019s challenges in business are allowing too many customers to have credit. She does not like collecting debt. Her hope for the future is to have a larger business. In her free-time, Beatrice likes to watch videos and have a few drinks. She hopes to use the loan for selling more goods out of her house.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Beatrice saying \"Idhi Nade\", which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Beatrice responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"thank you\" and \"Erokamano\", which in Luo means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in <a href=\"http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post.<\/a>\r\n<p>\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

They do not have children. Leena runs a video show and sells cereals like maize and beans. She shows Christian movies in a small shop, charging 5 shillings each. The programs usually last one hour.\r\n<p>\r\nLeena hopes to use the loan to improve her business by buying a fan for the video shop and a fridge for sodas and water. She says she is not facing any big challenges right now. In her free time, she likes to read storybooks and watch movies. Leena heard about K-MET from her friends.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Leena saying \"Idhi Nade\", which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Leena responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"thank you\" and \"Erokamano\", which in Luo means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in <a href=\"http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post.<\/a>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

M. is a 21-year-old who lives in Nyamasaria slum. He is single and has no children, but does have three brothers. He sells used clothes that he purchases from Kibuye, Kisumu\u2019s largest open-air market. David wants to use the loan to expand his business so that he can brighten his future. His challenges are he sometimes does not make a profit. He hopes that one day he can become a musician, a singer. In his free time, he likes reading storybooks and novels.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet David saying \"Idhi Nade\", which is Luo for \"How are you?\" David responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"thank you\" and \"Erokamano\", which in Luo means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in <a href=\"http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post.<\/a>\r\n<p>\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

She lives in Nyamasaria and runs a butchery where she sells beef. She will use the loan to purchase a cow for slaughter. She can buy a cow for anywhere from 15,000-25,000 KSH. Mary says she can make 2,000-3,000 KSH in profit. In January, Mary was hit by a car and broke her hip. She is still on crutches. This is a big challenge because it is hard for her to check up on her employees. Her hope for the future is to be able to move around again like she used to.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Mary saying \"Idhi Nade\", which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Mary responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"thank you\" and \"Erokamano\", which in Luo means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in <a href=\"http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post.<\/a>\r\n<p>\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

Awuor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is a 35-year-old mother of six children. She is married to a casual worker (similar to a day-laborer in the US). Elizabeth used to run a salon but but now cooks mandazi (a donut-like pastry) because the salon was too expensive to keep up. She hopes to use this loan to re-stock her salon, which she will run out of her house in Nyalenda slum. Elizabeth tells us that she is struggling to pay school fees for her children right now and says if she receives her loan, she will work harder. She says her kids love going to school.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Elizabeth saying \"Idhi Nade\", which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Elizabeth responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"thank you\" and \"Erokamano\", which in Luo means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in <a href=\"http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post.<\/a>\r\n<p>\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

Adhiambo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Scholastica Adhiambo O. is a 32-year-old mother of two children, ages 11 and one, and is married to a businessman. Her family lives in Nyalenda slum in Kisumu. She sells new clothing, purchased from Kampala in the town center at Lake Market. On average, she sees four to five customers a day. She hopes to use the loan to purchase more clothes to stock her shop with.\r\n<p>\r\nScholastica's main challenge is a lack of customers because citizens here in Kisumu are facing hard economic times. Scholastica says August to September are the times when she sells the most clothes. She likes running her own business because she is able to do things herself and nobody controls her. When asked who makes better entrepreneurs, men or women, she says women. This is a common answer, even from the men here in Kisumu because, as Scholastica says, the women care more for the children.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Scholastica saying \"Idhi Nade\", which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Scholastica responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"thank you\" and \"Erokamano\", which in Luo means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in <a href=\"http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post.<\/a>\r\n<p>\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

Ayango N. is a 25-year-old mother of three children. She is married to a lorry driver. Carren runs a small vegetable kiosk in Chiga market in the western end of Kismu. She hopes to use the loan to expand her business by purchasing more stock. She will use the profits to take care of her brothers and sisters who are also orphans, ranging in age from eight to 22. On Fridays, she purchases fruit and vegetables from wholesalers and sells them in Kibuye market, Kisumu\u2019s largest open-air market. Her hope is to find business partners so she can expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Carren saying \"Idhi Nade\", which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Carren responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"thank you\" and \"Erokamano\", which in Luo means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in <a href=\"http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post.<\/a>\r\n<p>\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

They live in large traditional extended families with their husbands, co-wives, parents-in-law, sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law, and children.  The group members average 40 years of age and six children each.  They grow mainly peanuts and millet.  \r\n\r\nTo satisfy their need for seeds, fertilizer, supplies, and equipment for growing peanuts and millet on over a dozen hectares, they decided to join the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso four years ago (four farming loans).   All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.   The current loan will be used to buy sacks of peanut seeds, millet, manure, and farming supplies at the grand marketplace of Koutiala.  Following the off-season, the crops are stored for a time, so that they gain in value, and then they are sold.  The group members sell their crops, retail and wholesale, particularly in cash to retailers and to a few consumers.  \r\n\r\nThe group members each intend to realize a profit of 50,000 francs CFA after the harvests.  In addition to repaying the loans, they will use a portion of the revenues to cope with common family expenses. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":328779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and minor farming supplies ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Korotoumi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia S\u00e9kou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Foun\u00e8 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bougoup\u00e8r\u00e8 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotimi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":480000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":480000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":480000,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:01Z","rounded_local_amount":488336.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152108,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-09T19:46:21Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":112779,"name":"Sugran Muhammad Arshad Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"My name is Sugran and I have been a citizen of Borewala, Pakistan, for the past ten years.

They know each other well.  They live in large traditional extended families and average 40 years of age and at least 6 children each.   They grow mainly peanuts and millet on over six hectares. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy their need for seeds, fertilizers, and small farming equipment, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program four years ago (four farming loans).  All the previous loans have been repaid without difficulty.  The current loan will be used to buy sacks of seeds for planting peanuts and millet, some manure, and small tools and supplies that are indispensable for farming.  These goods are gotten from the Koutiala City market from wholesalers.  After the off-season, the crops are stored for a time, so that they gain in value.  And then they are sold at the markets in the Koutiala area and at the grand marketplace, especially to retailers from large cities. \r\n\r\nAfter the crops are sold, the group members each intend to realize a profit of 40,000 francs CFA that will be used to make loan interest payments, and the rest will be used to cope with common family expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":328792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and equipment and supplies ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata Doulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Makoura Bourama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":330000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":330000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":330000,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":337185.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152109,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-03T04:57:19Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":112783,"name":"Hamidan Pervaiz Akhtar Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hamidan baji is a very hardworking lady.

They grow mainly peanuts and beans. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy their need for seeds, fertilizers, and small farming equipment, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program four years ago.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  The current loan will be used to buy farming equipment, a sufficient quantity of fertilizers and the like, and seeds for growing peanuts and beans.  Supplies of these different items are gotten at the Koutiala marketplace.  Their crops are sold at the grand marketplace of Koutiala (after the crops gain in value).  The customers include retailers and consumers. \r\n\r\nThe group members each hope to realize a profit of 80,000 francs CFA after selling the crops.  In addition to repaying the loan, a portion of the revenues will be used to cope with common family expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":328799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and small farming supplies ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maratou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta Dra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tenin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":750000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1625,"local_amount":750000,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":755759.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152110,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-12T04:18:52Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":112787,"name":"Sakina Muhammad Bashir Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sakina baji is a widow and has resided in Borewala, Pakistan, for the past fifteen years.

After the rainy season, the harvests are stocked for a certain time so that they gain in value before being sold at the big market of Koutiala and in the surrounding markets, retail or wholesale and for cash, to a clientele mostly coming from the big cities. <P>\r\n\r\nThe members of the Niagn\u00e9gu\u00e9ton 6 group each expect to make, after their agricultural produce has been sold, a profit of 80,000 F CFA which will be used to reimburse the loan and cover current family expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":328820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"purchase of entrants, seeds, and minor agricultural materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koniba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali Sinali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kanti\u00e8 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussokoro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Secho ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koumba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":511591.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152115,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-09T03:58:22Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":112799,"name":"Sami","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sami is a 34-year-old man living in Furn El Chebbak, Mount Lebanon.

She lives in a polygamous family with her co-wife and their children in the K\u00f4k\u00f4 district of Koutiala prefecture (Region of  Sikasso).  Not having had the chance to go to school, she soon became interested in earning an income at her mother's side.  After several kinds of work, Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba opted for buying and selling calabash bowls, a domain in which she is highly valued and in great demand for the quality of her goods. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba turned toward the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in 2005.  After four solidarity loans (group loans), all correctly repaid, she is now on her first individual loan.  She intends to use this loan to replenish her stock of calabash bowls.  Supplies are procured from producers in the surrounding villages.  Sales are made wholesale in Abidjan (capital of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and retail in the different districts of Koutiala.  Her customers are composed of retailers, women, and men.  Transactions are in cash and sometimes on credit.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to realize a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA that she will use to make loan interest payments, to support her family, and to invest the rest in her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Not having had the chance to continue in primary school because her parents lacked the means, she wasted no time going to work at her mother's side to earn an income.  Salimata has been advancing on her own now for ten years.  She chose as her niche the buying and selling of various goods, such as Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), jewelry, shoes, etc.  This is a very profitable business for her because she is in high demand by the women of Koutiala City. \r\n\r\nConcerned about augmenting her working capital and satisfying her customer demands for quality, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in 2007.  After two solidarity loans (group loans), all correctly repaid, she is now on her first individual loan.  She intends to buy 40 necklaces and 10 bolts of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i>.  Supplies are procured in Bamako and often in Senegal.  Sales are made in Koutiala City to customers composed of girls and married women, cash or credit accepted. \r\n\r\nSalimata hopes to realize a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that she envisions using to make loan interest payments, to care for her child, and to invest the rest in her business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

In 1982 with $5 in capital, she started this business, grilling and sell fresh fish in front of her parcel of land.  The period from 1982 to 1990 was characterized by apprenticing, acquiring experience in the trade, and building a permanent customer base.  The pillaging from 1991 to 1993 seriously damaged her business, destroying all her efforts.  In 2000, Fifi started up again and managed to achieve stability through determined work and good managing.  Today, her restaurant receives an average of 40 customers a day generating a profit of $10 daily.  Currently her capital amounts to $120.  \r\n\r\nGiven the growing number of customers who are demanding a lot of salted fish and chicken, and given her limited financial means, Fifi decided to join a HOPE RDC group named \u201cDivine El\u00e9vation Plus\u201d with the aim of receiving loans that will enable her to satisfy customer needs and to grow her business revenues.  Thus, with the loan received last May, she was able to buy a box of salted fish and some chickens, as planned, for her restaurant.   Her ambition is to open a store selling fresh staple foods.  \r\n\r\nFifi is 41 years old, unmarried, and the mother of a 21-year-old son.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

D. is from the village of Libertad Bajo, Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental. She is 43 years old. Rosalinda is married and has 7 school-aged children. To make a living, Rosalinda owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Rosalinda has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 2,000.00 PHP a month for these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Rosalinda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000.00 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase medication, vitamins and feed for the borrower's livestock. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Rosalinda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support the immediate members of her family. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:<p>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

","en":"Tashbubi is a 48-year-old woman.  She is married with three children. She and her husband work fattening and selling cattle. Tashbubi fattens the cattle at home, and when the cattle is ready, her husband sells them in the cattle market. Tashbubi has financed her business through our organization for a year.  She successfully paid off the previous loan, and now wishes to take out another loan. Tashbubi plans to increase the quantity of the cattle she sells and thereby increase the family's profit. Tashbubi really appreciates our credit terms, and she is glad that there are organizations like this supporting society.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Melissa Kniazeva, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":329169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Fattening and selling livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-06-09T00:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tashbubi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":547.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001289,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":547.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846431,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-10T17:43:37Z","paid_date":"2009-12-25T09:21:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":112933,"name":"Barotboy","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0411\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0431\u043e\u044e 44 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0446 5-\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u043d\u044e\u044e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0443, \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442. \u0411\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0411\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0431\u043e\u044f \u2013 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u0438 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0432\u043e. \u0418 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f. \u0421\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u0435\u0441\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0443, \u0438 \u0411\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u0421 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0437\u0438\u043c\u044b \u0411\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u041d\u043e \u043e\u043d \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c, \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430.","en":"Barotboy is 44 years old, married and the father of five children. His wife is not employed; she stays at home to do housework and feed the livestock. Barotboy raises and sells cattle. For Barotboy the beginning of summer means it's the season to buy animals, since in summer they and their feed is inexpensive. Beside, he doesn't need to spend much on feed because the livestock eat the mountain grasses. When winter begins Barotboy sells part of the finished herd, but does not buy more.

Primary School, Makeni Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are teachers of the Islaha Primary School, Makeni. This school was established in 1986 and gained government approval in 1996. Built by the Islaha Mission, a local, non-governmental organization, the school has a total of fifteen staff and 317 pupils.\r\n\r\nMany schools in Sierra Leone complain about the lack of adequate building, seating and learning materials. The Islaha Primary School is one of the worse examples \u2013 the Islaha mission lacks overseas sponsorship like other Christian\/Muslim missions. The school is still in its rudimentary stages. Though they use mud bricks, they have yet to complete the building process.\r\n\r\nMomodu A.C B. (back row, second from right) is the Head Teacher at the school and head of this group. Momodu is 36. He was born in Malimamy village, about thirty miles from Makeni city, in northern Sierra Leone.

products. She contacted an advisor during a weekly meeting that took place in the neighborhood, inquiring about how to form a committee of enterprising women. Once part of the program, she was able to group 15 women, which are now working together in their 8th cycle within the program. \r\n\r\nDuring the course of time, the group has experienced some inconveniences, as the daughter of the General Director was admitted to the hospital, and other participants were sick and bedridden. However, they responded without a single problem in repayments, and in this way the group has been able to progress, continuing with the program until now. \r\n\r\nThe average credit give per participant is 735,000 Gs, which goes to many different activities such as the sale of: food, hardware, grocery store products, clothing, lingerie, cosmetics, fruit, vegetables, cleaning products, crochet, etc. \r\n\r\nAll of them do their own activities in order to earn money, and mutually help each other achieve common objectives within the group and with the Paraguayan Foundation. They participate actively in weekly meetings and do an impeccably supportive job. \r\n\r\n1. Ma. Esther S. - Cleaning product sales \r\n2. Justina L. - Food sales \r\n3.

She has 3 children, all of whom she supports.  She operates a business buying and selling cold drinks and cosmetics.  She's operated the business for more than 2 years.  She started it because she needed a way to defray her family's expenses.  She also works as a cleaner at a health center but the little that she earns there isn't enough to cover [her? the children's?] schooling and she decided to set up the business at home selling cold drinks such as pozol [a local drink made from cacao and maize], cebada [a local drink made from barley] and tiste [a local drink made from cacao].  Maria continues struggling to study and get ahead.  The loan will be used to buy maize, pozol and cebada, as well as cosemetics.  Maria's dream is to keep both businesses so that she can have the income she needs to support her children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

Gracia, 73, is a single mother.  She supports 5 children, all in school.  She operates a small general store, a business that she's had for more than 21 years.  Dona Maria decided to start the business because she needed to find a way to support her children.  She's always been a very responsible woman and someone who has had to be both mother and father to her children.

Elle aimait son travail et \u00e9tait d\u00e9termin\u00e9e d\u2019avoir un jour son propre capital \u00e0 partir de ces d\u00e9chets. De 1990 \u2013 1993, Aniesse accumule des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices et parvient \u00e0 totaliser un montant de $25 comme capital propre qui lui avait permis d\u2019acheter de bons habits \u00e0 revendre. De 1993 \u2013 2000, par un dur travail et une bonne gestion et des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices accord accumul\u00e9s, elle d\u00e9cide de changer l\u2019activit\u00e9 pour se lancer dans le commerce alimentaire. De lors, elle a d\u00e9but\u00e9 la vente de 7 sacs de ma\u0457s de 50 kilos. De 2000 \u00e0 ce jour, elle a dans son stock, 13 sacs de ma\u0457s de 50 kilos. Actuellement, son capital est de $250 et son affaire lui g\u00e9n\u00e8re un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de $25 par semaine. Le cr\u00e9dit qu\u2019elle a obtenu au mois de mai dernier lui a servi d\u2019acheter 3 sacs de mais pour renforcer le stock en vue d\u2019accroitre le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice. Son ambition est d\u2019ouvrir un d\u00e9p\u00f4t des ma\u0457s et celui des boissons. Aniesse est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 42 ans, veuve et m\u00e8re de 6 enfants dont leurs \u00e2ges varient de 6 \u00e0 23 ans. Le plus \u00e2g\u00e9 des enfants est ind\u00e9pendant et deux seulement des autres enfants vont \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. Elle est une cliente fid\u00e8le de Hope qui a re\u00e7u trois fois les cr\u00e9dits qu\u2019elle a rembours\u00e9s totalement et \u00e0 temps.","en":"Aniesse K. didn\u2019t think that one day she would be able to obtain financial support from someone who she never met for the purpose of bolstering and developing her business.  She sells corn in a mountainous district, west of Kinshasa.   She started her business in 1990 by selling used clothing, discarded by owners, to earn next-to-nothing.  This is why people call her \u201cMaman Man\u0153uvre\u201d, which means someone who has nothing in the way of capital but who sells no matter what merchandise and is dependant on others to survive.  She liked her work and was determined to have her own working capital one day, apart from these cast-offs.  \r\n\r\nFrom 1990-1993, Aniesse accumulated profits and managed to total $25 in capital, which had enabled her to buy good clothing to resell.  From 1993-2000, through hard work, good managing, and accumulated profits, she decided to switch to another business, getting started in the commerce of food.  As such, she began by selling seven 50-kg sacks of corn.  Since 2000, she has had her own stock of goods, thirteen 50-kg sacks of corn.  Currently, her capital amounts to $250, and her business generates for her a profit of $25 per week.  \r\n\r\nThe loan she obtained last May was used to buy three sacks of corn for bolstering her inventory with the aim of growing her profits.  Her ambition is to open an outlet for corn and for beverages.  \r\n\r\nAniesse is 42 years old, a widow, and the mother of six children, ranging in age from 6 to 23.  The eldest is on his own, and only two are going to school.  She is a loyal customer of HOPE who received loans three times and who repaid them completely and on time.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She is raising them by herself as her husband passed away. She sells clothes in Kisumu, just off the main street. She hopes to expand her business and make enough profit to purchase a cow. The cow will serve as both an extra source of food as well as a buffer against food insecurity should she face it in the future. \r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear the interviewer greet Millicent saying \u201cIdhi Nade\u201d, which is Luo for \u201cHow are you?\u201d Millicent responds, \u201cAdhi maber,\u201d meaning \u201cvery good.\u201d Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama\u2019s father. At the end, you will hear the interviewer fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \u201cAsante Sana\u201d in Kiswahili, meaning \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201cErokamano\u201d, which in Luo means \u201cthank you.\u201d The voices in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting.

She started the business when she was abandoned, already a mother, but facing her situation with great bravery and investing some savings that she had in the purchase of merchandise for resale.  She then built a customer base, some buying from her with cash and others on credit.  At first, it was a bit difficult since her children were small and she didn't have a regular customer base that she could depend on.  She had to walk long stretches to find customers.  She never chose to leave her children because she's always been a responsible and caring mother.  Happily, she's managed to face all that life has thrown at her and she's pleased that she's found the strength and courage to do it.  She wants a loan for working capital which she'll use to buy the products that she most urgently needs: shoes, cosmetics, pants, children's clothes and perfumes, among other things.<br

G. is 55 years old and married with 7 children. Six of them live independently and the seventh is 14 and still lives at home. Ines works buying and selling staple grains, a business he started as a high school teacher when his salary was so low that he decided to try out selling pigs. This helped him much more than he was anticipating, and from there he moved on to his current venture which has been very profitable. Since its beginning, his business has prospered since he has been able to buy more grains from the wholesalers each time, and although he has had many health problems, he has stayed strong, and has managed to provide his older children with a good education. His youngest daughter is still in school, and he wants to see her grow up to become a successful young woman with solid values. Ines' deepest wish is to buy a bulk truck which will allow him to transport grains from the northern part of the country. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cyrus Maher, Kiva

A. is a 28-year-old mother of three children. She is married to a businessman who sells second hand belts. She has a small boutique just outside of the main downtown area in Kisumu. She buys her clothing stock from Busia, which is on the border with Uganda. This is her first loan.\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear the interviewer greet Eunice saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Eunice responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, the interviewer fluctuates between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you,\" and \"Erokamano,\" which in Luo means \"thank you.\" The voices in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\r\n\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

O. is the mother of five children and grandmother to ten children. She is unsure of her age, but guestimated (off-camera) it's around 70. She sells reed mats and vegetables in Dunga Beach, about 5 kms outside of Kisumu. She will use the loan to buy more bamboo for weaving and to buy more vegetables. Her main challenge is short finances and she sometimes must use her own vegetable stock, normally used for selling, for food. Her hope for the future is to receive a loan and improve her lifestyle. This is her first loan. \r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear the interviewer greet Monica saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Monica responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, the interviewer fluctuates between Kiswahili and Luo, saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you,\" and \"Erokamano,\" which in Luo means \"thank you.\" The voices in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\r\n\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

The women know one another through ties of kinship and community.  They buy and sell several kinds of grains (peanuts, beans, millet,...) and various other goods. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy their burgeoning customer base, the group members decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their sixth solidarity loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  They intend to use this loan to buy 500 kg of wheat flour, 100 kg of rice, and 200 kg of corn.  Supplies of the flour are gotten in Gueya (a village of the sister republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire);  the rice and corn, at weekly markets of Fakola from producers.  While the flour is sold to retailers and bakers in the village, the grains are sold to retailers from large cities, such as Kolondi\u00e8ba, Bougouni, Bamako, etc.\r\n\r\nThe group members each hope to realize an average profit of 50,000 francs CFA per month that will be used to make loan interest payments, to cover family expenses, and to invest the rest in income-generating businesses.

He lives in Belo, Cameroon and sets up shop in the Belo Market. Elijah buys and sells goods at his general store. With this loan he plans to purchase one bag of rice, two cartons of soap, a half carton of dry fish, three bags of Maggi (a popular seasoning in Cameroon), one roll of sugar and two buckets of Gari.\r\n<p>\r\nElijah believes his business will succeed because he sells the basic necessities that people need. He also works hard and is good to his customers. Financially, Elijah sells his products at moderate prices and thinks ahead by saving some of his money in a credit union.\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough Elijah has had some obstacles, such as fire destroying his plantain farm and learning how to run a good business, he is still trying. With the profits from this loan, Elijah looks forward to paying his child's school fees, saving some of it with GHAPE, buying plantain to plant in his farm, increasing his business and contributing to his Njangi group.\r\n<p>\r\nNjangi groups in Cameroon are an informal way to lend money. Each month a different member collects the group's dues and may use it for whatever they please. It is very prevalent, as you can see groups dressed in their distinct uniforms around town, near the time they meet.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Elijah's second loan from GHAPE since he became a member in early 2008. Elijah takes out GHAPE loans because \"of their truthfulness\" and the way in which everything is documented.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":329322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy rice, soap, dry fish, maggi (a seasoning), sugar, and gari to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Nganti, Belo, N.W.

She sells vegetables in one of the most well-known markets in the Huaral province, for more than 14 years, because her mother persuaded her to help with the business since she was very young. Thanks to this, she now has some space next to her mother's stall, where she offers a variety of vegetables that she buys in bulk. Flor has always enjoyed the interaction she has with people, since she is very charismatic with everyone who asks for her products, making them loyal to her business. On the other hand, the hard part is being all day at her stall withstanding the changes in weather, but she knows these things come with the job. In the near future she wants to have a larger business where she can sell more quantities. This is the first loan she has with Microfinanzas PRISMA, and she promises to be very punctual with her payments. With this money she will buy a larger quantity of produce to satisfy the necessities of her clientele, which grows more every day.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esteban Riojas, Kiva

El negocio va bien y Gregoria quiere hacerlo crecer, pero sabe que eso no ser\u00e1 nada f\u00e1cil, porque el solo hecho de tejer una chompa le toma dos d\u00edas y producir en gran cantidad se le hace m\u00e1s complicado. Su deseo es poder conseguir a una persona que la ayuda a producir en mayor cantidad, felizmente a Gregoria le gusta su trabajo, por lo que lo hace con alegr\u00eda, obteniendo siempre muy buenos acabados. Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo individual, y seguir\u00e1 con la misma responsabilidad que la caracteriza, pues cuando trabaj\u00f3 en bancos comunales siempre fue muy puntual en el pago de todas sus cuotas. Con el dinero que esta vez est\u00e1 solicitando, comprar\u00e1 gran cantidad de material para elaborar sus artesan\u00edas, adem\u00e1s de lana para tejer sus chompas y as\u00ed producir en mayor cantidad y generar mayores ingresos para toda su familia.","en":"Gregoria is 39 years old, and lives with her husband and two children in their own home. She makes manual crafts like bracelets, earrings, and necklaces made with seeds and other materials which make the final product very pretty. She has many customers in her neighborhood who purchase her products. She also knits wool jumpers which are very well priced at this time of winter, as the temperature grows colder. The business is doing well and Gregoria wants to make it grow, but she knows this won't be easy since the process of knitting a single jumper takes two days and producing a larger quantity is more complicated. Her wish is to hire someone who can help her produce larger quantities. Gregoria happily enjoys her job, that she does with joy, getting always nice finishes. This is her first individual loan, and she will continue with the same responsibility that characterizes her, because when she worked in communal banks she was always very punctual in her payments. With the money she is now requesting she will purchase a large quantity of material to make her crafts as well as wool to knit her jumpers and this way produce a larger quantity to generate more income for all of her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esteban Riojas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":329452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase of materials for arts and crafts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-06T08:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":297.85},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":317.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":324.14},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":339.42},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":354.43},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":366.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.52},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.16},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.4},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100.52,"local_amount":297.85,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":298.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990693,"comment":null},{"amount":479.63,"local_amount":1421.13,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1424.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211795,"comment":null},{"amount":94.85,"local_amount":281.02,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":281.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080759,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-08T11:53:06Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":113071,"name":"Juan Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Juan Manuel P. ya ha sido acreditado de FVP el cual pago puntualmente.

Th\u1ecb is a 36-year-old woman living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1. H\u00e0 is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 036-Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng (18-01-036).\r\n\r\nH\u00e0 is married and has one school-aged child.  To make a living, H\u00e0 makes and sells rice products in the local community. H\u00e0 has been engaged in this business for more than five years and earns approximately 1.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, H\u00e0 joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. H\u00e0 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2.442.600 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND which will also be used to purchase additional products. This will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. H\u00e0 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1. N. Th\u1ecb V\u00e2n is a 37-year-old woman who is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her general store.\r\n\r\n2. N. Th\u1ecb Lan is a 23-year-old woman who is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her business of making and selling food.\r\n\r\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nH\u00e0 N.

Th\u1ecb is a 46-year-old woman living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1. L\u1ed9c is the leader of a four-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women (FPW). While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 027- Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng.\r\n\r\nL\u1ed9c is married and has two adult children. To making a living, L\u1ed9c manufactures and sells clay products to local businesses and community members. L\u1ed9c has been engaged in this business for more than two years and earns approximately 1.200.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, L\u1ed9c  joined Thanh Hoa FPW to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. L\u1ed9c has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3.079.800 VND from Thanh Hoa FPW. This previous loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offerings. She is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND which will also be used to purchase additional raw materials. This will be the fourth loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa FPW. L\u1ed9c  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1.  P. Th\u1ecb G\u1ea5m is a 38-year-old female who is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her general store.\r\n\r\n2.  N.

","en":"Davron is a young man who was born in 1979.  He is married and is the father of 1 child.  Davron makes flatbread and his wife sells it at the \u201cPanchshanbe\u201d market.  Davron purchases flour from wholesalers in advance in order to provide insurance for himself in case the flour supply stops temporarily.  Davron has his own regular customers who take flatbread for resale and pay him right after they sell it.  Davron has been our borrower since 2007.  He always uses his loans purposefully.

married, and the father one child. Abduhoshim has a flock of livestock consisting of approximately 35 sheep and 15 goats. His wife is a housewife and processes wool in her spare time.  Every morning, Abduhoshim drives the herd to the mountains, grazes them, and drives them back in the evening.

He is married and is the father of 6 children.  His wife does not have a job.  She stays at home and does the housework and feeds the livestock.  Soliboy fattens and sells livestock.  The start of summer is the season to purchase livestock for Soliboy because in the spring livestock and feed are cheap and you do not need to pay a lot to fatten livestock.  The livestock eats the mountain grass and Soliboy can save on the livestock feed.  With the start of winter Soliboy sells part of the fattened livestock, but he does not purchase livestock.  He purchases feed to fatten the leftover livestock.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":329555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Fatten and sell livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.217778 69.725","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-06-09T19:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soliboy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:21:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846442,"comment":null},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110737403,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-06-23T21:09:13Z","paid_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":113109,"name":"Bihosiyat","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041e\u0447\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0411\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0441\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 , \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0432\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0432 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0443 \u0445\u043b\u0435\u0431\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0411\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0441\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e \u0438\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0439\u043b\u044f. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0434, \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0424\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0430. \u0411\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0441\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043d\u0438\u043c\u043a\u0435 \u0432 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0438.","en":"Bihosiyat O. is a woman who sells bread and miscellaneous food products in front of the entrance to the city hospital.

business is a family business where she works with her husband. The business is an art shop where Nisreen's husband paints pictures and signs, writes in Arabic in a special artistic way for special events, and decorates vases with colors and flowers.\n\nNisreen's husband started the business a few years ago with only two US dollars.  After he lost all hope of finding a job, in spite of having finished his university degree, he used the two dollars to buy markers, coloring pens and papers. His work was successful. Then he got married and now he has three boys, aged 10, 2, and 1 years old. With the help of his wife the business grew quickly. There was high demand from the market, so Nisreen was responsible for decorating the vases with flowers and selling to customers while her husband was responsible for the painting.\n\nDuring the last war in Gaza in late-December 2008 and early-January 2009, Nisreen lost her business when it was bombed. She and her husband lost everything -- raw materials, inventory, etc. -- but they never lost hope and they intend to continue working under any condition, especially now that they have children. \n\nThe family approched FATEN's branch in Jabalia for a business loan in the amount of 2000 USD, since they had already signed with UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) to provide

To make a living, Conchita owns and operates a business manufacturing and selling clay products to local businesses and community members. Conchita has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $43 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Conchita joined PMPC, one of Kiva's field partners, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Conchita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to increase her product offerings. Conchita is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Conchita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative: PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":329580,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"To
