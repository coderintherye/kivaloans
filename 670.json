This is how the couple strives every day to strengthen the family finances with the income they earn.  \r\n\r\nIn spite of these other jobs that they do, they continue to farm their land, where they mainly grow vegetables, especially carrots. They feel great satisfaction in having achieved this as a family, and their wish is to continue improving all their businesses, and to give a boost to their grocery store.   \r\n\r\nThis is the tenth loan she has applied for.

expresses a sincere appreciation to all social investors from Kiva, who supported Mamlekat in her business by financing her Kiva credit lines.  Mamlekat was born in the city of Karabalta (Jaiyl district, Kyrgyz Republic).  She has been a widow since 1987 and lives with her youngest son.  Mamlekat was born into a family of a veterinarian and a milkmaid.  Since young age, she had helped her parents with the household and was an independent child.  She got married in 1977 at the age of 20.  Her husband and she lived with his parents in the Stepnoe village (45 km north of Karabalta).  Their son Anvar was born one year later.  Mamlekat's husband worked at the \"Hammer and Sickle\" collective farm and helped Mamlekat get a job of a milkmaid there.  With time, they moved away from the parents and relocated to the city of Karabalta, where they bought a small house nearby a collective farm, where they both worked.  Their second son Ildar was born in 1987.  Also this same year, Mamlekat's husband passed away due an incurable sickness.  She steadfastly lived through this period, continued working as a milkmaid at the collective farm and also kept a dairy cow, given to her by the collective farm, at home.  Her sons grew and so did their needs.  Her salary was no longer enough to support the family, and this why she decided to start her own business.  in 1991, Mamlekat sold her house, all of the remaining livestock (two dairy cows and two bulls) in Karabalta and bought an abandoned shed 5 km away from the Stepnoe village.  Mamlekat's parents helped a little with fixing up the shed and also with buying first few calves.  This is how Mamlekat has been involved in breeding cattle in her own shed over the period of ten years.  Currently, Mamlekat has 13 dairy cows, 25 bulls, 10 calves and 2 horses, and also several goats.  She married off her son two years ago, and he now lives with his family in her parents' house and takes care of them.  In order to further increase her livestock quantity, Mamlekat requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.  She plans to buy young bulls for fattening up.  With time, Mamlekat dreams of increasing her cattle headcount and helping her son to buy a house in Karabalta."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1051.18,"image":{"id":869950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to

He hopes that, in the future, he will diversify to open a school, since he and his wife are both teachers.

In 1995, Rysbek and his wife decided to start their own business of reselling vegetables and fruits.  Using a starting capital of 2,000 som (KGS), Rysbek was able to develop his business to have a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS).  A lot of effort and hard work allowed Rysbek to improve his family's living conditions and to buy a Mercedes vehicle for transporting fruits and vegetables.  To further develop his business, Rysbek requested a loan in the sum of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.

Robert exudes nothing but confidence.\r\nHe set forth in his business on his own hook and all the strides he has made have come as a result of his unwavering and tenacious hard work ethic.\r\nIt\u2019s fair to say Robert is now on the inside lane to become a past master in business. He has soaked up loads of experience, and day in, day out, Robert feels he is getting well posted with the nitty gritty and fundamentals of running a business. Does this spell success for his enterprise? In many respects it does.\r\n\r\nHe has been able to handle most of his adversity philosophically. Robert has also made sure he does not get complacent as his business grows. Before he nurtured the idea of bearing a hand in this business, Robert was mostly inclined to a coffee selling business. His auxiliary businesses (to wit, cattle and food sales) have aided him in the consolidation of his business profits. Weekly, Robert says this business generates him sales returns totaling to Uganda shillings 25,000.\r\n\r\nThe records indicate that Robert's group is on their 4th loan cycle. Their repayment record is up to the mark.

Svetlana graduated from the Kyrgyz State University with a social sciences teaching major and spent a long time working at the local boarding school.  Unfortunately, her salary did not cover all of her family's expenses, and Svetlana decided to start her own retail business.  She is involved in selling children's clothing because it is traditionally in high demand.  In order to further expand her merchandise selection by adding children's shoes, Svetlana requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.  She plans to use some of the income from the loan to make repairs to her home.  In the future, Svetlana dreams of traveling the entire Kyrgyzstan and see all of the attractions of her

Brenda hopes that in the future she will be able to become a doctor. \r\n\r\nBrenda is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Brenda\u2019s future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

She lives with her family group which consists of her husband and her four daughters who are all in school.  Mar\u00eda owns a stall in her local market where she sells a variety of cereals such as corn, beans and rice.  The place is very busy and very strategically located as it is in the center of the city where Mar\u00eda lives.  She has been in this business for a long time and thanks to God, her cheerfulness and her hard work, she has known how to keep the business going.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is the kind of woman who enjoys contributing towards her household finances and so she gets up very early every morning and goes to her business in order to earn her daily bread which she will then take home.  The most important thing in Mar\u00eda's life is her family and this is what drives her to work hard, with the hope that she will improve their quality of life.  This has led her to take the decision to request a loan from INTEGRAL to invest in her business by purchasing cereals (corn, rice and beans) wholesale.  Her aim is to have available the quantity she needs for her customers and to obtain it at lower prices.  She trusts in God that, in this way, she will manage to improve her own life as well as that of her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":154.12,"image":{"id":870676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"to buy cereals (corn, rice and beans)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-09-18T10:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":28.79},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30.82},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":31.32},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":34.7},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":34.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40.3},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41.76},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":46.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":47.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.79},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.82},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.32},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.7},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.3},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.76},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.57},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.79,"local_amount":28.79,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-18T09:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":28.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238546111,"comment":null},{"amount":29.14,"local_amount":29.14,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":29.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244505700,"comment":null},{"amount":31.81,"local_amount":31.81,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":31.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250713176,"comment":null},{"amount":33.11,"local_amount":33.11,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":33.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257116030,"comment":null},{"amount":31.27,"local_amount":31.27,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":31.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241145,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T01:29:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":335967,"name":"Virgen De F\u00e1tima Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Comit\u00e9 Virgen de F\u00e1tima se conform\u00f3 con la iniciativa de una de las miembros, est\u00e1 integrado por 10 mujeres, actualmente est\u00e1n en el primer ciclo.

She lives with her family group which consists of her husband, 29-year-old Jos\u00e9 Antonio, and her two beloved daughters.\r\n\r\nBlanca's business is making and selling delicious, varied and reasonably-priced meals.  Her business is located in the food section of the central market in the city where she lives.  The place is very busy, especially Blanca's diner, as she always has the best dishes on offer and always serves her customers with a smile.  This means that her customers come back to eat her delicious food.\r\n\r\nBlanca's dream is to see her business thrive and become the number one food seller in her area.  However, in order to achieve this, she needs to invest a certain quantity of money in buying a larger quantity of supplies so that she can offer different dishes.  She needs a large enough quantity so that she can attract more customers which will allow her to achieve her dream.  This justifies her decision to request this loan from INTEGRAL.

She earns a living by running a beauty salon, and is excited to be taking out her third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid two previous loans and using them to expand her business. She started her business eight years ago after spending one year working for a friend while becoming a beautician.

She lives in her own house with her beloved, 7-year-old daughter, Mayli.  What she most desires is to provide her with a better quality of life and is willing to work very hard to do so.  Ana, at her young age, is both father and mother to her daughter.  In face of her partner\u2019s absence, she tries to get ahead and give the best of herself so that her beloved daughter will want for naught.  \r\n\r\nEvery day, very early, she goes out to work in the green fields.  For her, there are no days off because she must work continually in her field in order to have a good harvest.  The main things she grows are: cocoa beans, coffee and bananas which, once harvested, she takes to sell in various markets in the city of San Francisco.  What she most likes about her work is the freedom she has working her fields because she can freely enjoy the green countryside.  She\u2019s been in this line of work for 7 years and considers the most difficult part of it having to work during the heavy rainy season because rains in this part of the Peruvian Amazon region are continuous.

Mar\u00eda has been in business for more than eight years.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to buy fish for her daily business.  She has participated in 15 loan cycles with the Communal Bank and likes the meetings because they allow her to share nice moments with her friends.

She lives in her own house with her husband, Abrah\u00e1n, 33, and their two beloved children, Giuliana, 12, and Frans, 8, who are the motivating force behind all her efforts.  \r\n\r\nWorking hard, Eudosia has managed that her fields produce the necessary products to support her family.  Before the first sun\u2019s rays appear she leaves her house and walks nearly an hour to reach her fields where she has cocoa beans, coffee and hardwood trees planted - products that she subsequently takes to various gathering sites.  \r\n\r\nWhat she most likes about her work is cultivating her fields because she feels she\u2019s putting them to good use.  She\u2019s been in this activity for 10 years and considers the most difficult part having to transport her products because the sacks she carries are very heavy and they tire her out quite a bit.  In time, she\u2019d like to buy more land to increase income.\r\n\r\nThis will be her sixth MFP loan.  She is very happy to continue to access credit and wants to thank all the people who will make it possible for her to obtain the money she needs.

She and her husband are always working, but during the harvest they hire day labourers; this allows them to extract and select their products more quickly. Her plan for the future is to continue expanding her agricultural production so that she can continue to satisfy her customers, thus improving her living conditions.

She is a hard-working woman who lives in her own house with her husband Ra\u00fal, 36, and their three dear children, to whom they want to offer a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRebeca farms near the town of Santa Rosa in the rural part of Ayacucho department.  Her products are very good. That is why her coffee and cacao plants are highly valued in the towns of San Francisco and Santa Rosa, where she sells all of her harvest. \r\n\r\nWhat she most likes about her work is harvesting her crops. She finds it satisfying to see the fruits of her labor after many months of care and dedication.  During the times of harvesting and weeding, she works her land with the help of day laborers. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this work for 15 years.  She considers the most difficult part to be controlling crop diseases that are affecting the cacao and coffee beans more and more. In time, she hopes to develop more of her land, and in this way benefit from what every plant produces.\r\n\r\nThis will be her tenth loan with MFP, and she hopes to benefit once again from the support of the lenders in order to continue making progress.  Consequently she is committed to making her scheduled payments on time.  With the 3,000 nuevos soles, she will buy natural fertilizers to improve her land.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":612.86,"image":{"id":871090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-19T23:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rebeca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":253.28},{"due_date":"2011-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":265.8},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":272.22},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":284.8},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":290.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":305.09},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":317.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":324.65},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":339.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":347.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.46},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.81},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.43},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.43},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.86},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.43},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":92.87,"local_amount":253.28,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":253.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851347,"comment":null},{"amount":97.46,"local_amount":265.8,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":266.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666537,"comment":null},{"amount":99.81,"local_amount":272.22,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":272.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621686,"comment":null},{"amount":104.43,"local_amount":284.8,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":285.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835768,"comment":null},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":284.07,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":284.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245527,"comment":null},{"amount":114.13,"local_amount":311.27,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":311.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385579,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-09-20T04:08:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":336078,"name":"Mercilenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercilenda is 29 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She is a hard-working woman who lives in her own house with her partner Ra\u00fal, 32, and their two dear children; Maida, who is nine, and Aurelio who is four. Their children are the reason for all their efforts. Rebeca is industrious, and every day she tries very hard to do her best for the members of her family. She is a farmer, and grows coffee and cacao. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this work for five years, with great care and diligence. Thanks to the harvest that her crops provide, she bought another block of land in order to continue farming.  At harvest and at weeding time she has to hire day laborers, in order to get the planned work done more quickly. \r\n\r\nPart of her land is not cultivated, and inevitably, support from a financial institution is required to carry forward the work. She plans to sow her lands with more coffee plants, and for that reason applied for one of the loans that MFP makes available to low income people looking to progress in their lives.
