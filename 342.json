She lives in her own home with her husband Enrique, also 50, and her greatest wish is to have a peaceful life as she grows older.\r\n\r\nHer business is located in the Tupac Amaru market (an important market in the city of Juliaca). She sells clothing and her stall is one of the busiest ones because she brings the clothing she sells from Lima. For this reason her stock of clothing is modern and of very good quality.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her job is chatting with the neighboring vendors in the market, which makes her long workdays more pleasant. She has been doing this work for 12 years and thinks the hardest part is staying at her stand all day awaiting customers. In time she would like to expand her stall in order to make it more comfortable.\r\n\r\nThis is Tereza's first loan with MFP and she has promised to be on time with her payments. In her Communal Bank she is known as a happy person and she always has advice for other members.

She is 47 years old. Myrna is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMyrna is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Myrna sells sand & gravel in the local community. Myrna has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Myrna joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myrna has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Myrna is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Myrna from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

O. is from the village of Bato in Plaridel, Misamis Occidental. She is 46 years old. Morita is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Morita owns and operates a clothing business where she sells new clothing to local community members. Morita has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Morita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Morita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Morita is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP to purchase additional inventory and use working capital. This will be Morita's third loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 26 years old. Maricel is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Maricel owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a clothing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling new clothes to the local community members. Maricel has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Maricel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maricel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Maricel is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Maricel from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Myrna has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Myrna joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myrna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC. She used her previous loan to purchase additional products to sell. Myrna is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This will be Myrna's second loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 55 years old. Carmen is the leader of a 5-member loan group sponsored by GDMPC. Although each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for repaying the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCarmen is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Carmen runs a general store where she sells a variety of different products, such as shampoo, sugar, salt, noodles, juice packs, Milo (chocolate milk powder), and eggs, in the local community. Carmen has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP each month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Carmen joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carmen is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP to expand her business. This will be Carmen's first loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. Claire is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from GDMPC.

This previous loan was used to to purchase additional raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.\r\n\r\nAnita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used for the same purpose. This loan will be her 2nd from PMPC and her second from Kiva. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the living conditions of her family and to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns an average of approximately 1,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Maria Chuchi joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.\r\n\r\nMaria Chuchi is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. This loan will be her ninth from PMPC and her second from Kiva. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the living conditions of her family and to support the education of her children.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

In Bolivia an Aut\u00f3cona woman is one who wears \u201cpolleras\u201d (a traditional long skirt) and \u201cmantas\u201d (shawls).  These polleras and mantas are sold more in the western part of the country.\r\n\r\nJennny buys clothes from the stores that rent clothing for dances.  She sells in the 12 de octubre region.  This region is very popular in the city of El Alto because you do not have to pay to sell.  At these stands the pollera is what sells the most. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Antonio, is a salaried driver for the Pedro Domingo Murillo union.  Jenny makes lots of sacrifices in her work because she not only sells clothes, but she also helps her husband by collecting fares for his transportation service.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy clothes wholesale.

Her husband's business was selling garlic wholesale.  They have three children who are in school.  Thanks to a lot of effort, they made their home that still needs plaster on the walls and a floor.  They have improved it little by little but due to a lack of money, they still need to finish it since prices have increased, and they have put their loans toward their business.  With this loan, she will buy:  rice, beans, sugar, oil, soap, candy, soft drinks, dairy products, and boxes of garlic to sell and to offer to her customers.  She hopes this will improve her sales since in the last few months she hasn't sold much.

Alyeris started this business so that she could earn her own money and not become dependent on her parents. She has been making sales for seven years. Her customers place their orders with her and she accepts payments by cash or on credit. The only problem is that many of her customers delay their payments, which hurts her because she is left with little available capital.\r\n<p>\r\nAlyeris stores her merchandise in her room, which makes it uncomfortable. She needs to have a location from where she can sell her products.

He and his wife started their family at a young age and now they have three children.  Abraham has been selling chamomile and cinnamon wholesale for the past seven years.  He previously sold these products before, but he gave it up when he attracted more customers selling medicine, which he was able to acquire at low cost and generate good sales.  Within the past few weeks, his sales have gone down.  Prices have increased on everything as a result of the financial crisis the country is experiencing.  There are few jobs and workers are underpaid.  \r\n<p>\r\nAbraham wants to enclose his land, so he started building a wall around his property.  However, he lacks the remaining materials to finish the wall.  He needs to buy cement, sand, and gravel and also pay for labor.  A completed wall will provide better security against the crime that is plaguing the neighborhood.  His previous loans have been the only means in which Abraham has been able to make improvements to his small modest home.  It is important to enclose his land so that he can continue making improvements to his house at a later time.  He is happy that he is able to achieve his objectives, thanks to the financing provided by AFODENIC.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":476133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"Purchase construction materials to finish building a wall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-24T07:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abraham","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.29,"local_amount":1445.83,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1510.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874568,"comment":null},{"amount":34.73,"local_amount":694.51,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":725.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639904,"comment":null},{"amount":35.11,"local_amount":702.19,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":733.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821686,"comment":null},{"amount":35.3,"local_amount":706.09,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561694,"comment":null},{"amount":32.65,"local_amount":653.04,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":682.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770623,"comment":null},{"amount":35.58,"local_amount":711.68,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":743.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204512,"comment":null},{"amount":36.61,"local_amount":732.2,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":765.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330227,"comment":null},{"amount":67.73,"local_amount":1354.46,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1415.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465398,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-24T11:37:18Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171085,"name":"Satou Ibou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Satou Ibra F. est une femme de 47 ans, elle mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 6 enfants.

They have a board that was elected democratically by assembly, in which Daria was elected president.  She has a business selling food next to the bus stop for minibus \"263.\"  Florentina was elected treasurer; she sells candy.  Estela is the secretary, and she is a homemaker.  The group is also developing other activities. The foundation of the group is formed by Mariela, who sells clothing, Edgar, who repairs cellular phones, Heriberto, who works at a golf club, Monica, who sells food with her mother, Vincent, who works as a mechanic in an auto repair shop, Veronica, who works as a domestic, and finally Virginia, who works in a photocopy shop.

Currently, the boy is studying, but he is also working to contribute to the household expenses. The family's central plan is to make improvements to their home, in order to raise their quality of life. Jose has earned a living as a mason for 20 years. Among the main difficulties he has faced are the asthma attacks he suffers, which affect him most strongly when he is at home. This is due to the impoverished conditions he lives in, which increase his risk of having more frequent asthma attacks.

The loan will be used to purchase construction materials to begin remodeling the open areas of their home.

For the future, he hopes that his business progresses and that he is able to improve his income.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Elmer's fourth loan with MFP and he doesn't want to miss any payments for lack of money, so he is already making contacts to sell his bricks.  He is the only young man in his community bank, so therefore he always tries to be responsible and respectful of his female colleagues.  With the 2,000 new soles he is requesting, he will buy new molds for making bricks, and thus increase the quantity that he produces daily.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy McGinty, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":476182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"To buy brick molds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-23T19:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.72},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124520,"comment":null},{"amount":120.72,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:12Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960261,"comment":null},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:11Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993105,"comment":null},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717891,"comment":null},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751566,"comment":null},{"amount":121.44,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":346.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934034,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-23T21:14:28Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171103,"name":"Ayten","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ayten Q. is 21 years old.

D., who was born in 1974 in the city of Managua, is married; her husband works as a security guard, supporting  Maritza and covering the monthly household expenses.They live in the Waspan Norte neighborhood. Maritza is the mother of 5 children, only 2 of whom still depend on their parents. Maritza works in the eastern market in Managua, selling fast food and beverages. She prepares the food in her house and carries it to her food stall in the market. The worst misfortune that has occurred in Maritza's life has been a loan that she requested 4 years ago. As she left the bank with the 5000 US dollars in cash, she was assaulted. The experience stripped her of the hope of working to improve her life and the lives of her family members.

The money that she is asking for now is for the purchase of more products, so that she can sell not just by showing the catalogue, but also with the product in the hand.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":476291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Increase stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-24T05:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":261.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960265,"comment":null},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":261.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993109,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":261.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717895,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":261.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751570,"comment":null},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":261.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934038,"comment":null},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":261.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672791,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-24T07:46:39Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171142,"name":"Victor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"V\u00edctor es un hombre muy laborioso y responsable de 48 a\u00f1os, \u00e9l est\u00e1 al cuidado de su madre anciana, y a pesar que nunca se cas\u00f3 y no tiene hijos es muy cari\u00f1oso con los ni\u00f1os.

Although he has never married and has no children of his own, he is very affectionate with children.  His house is very far from the city but it is a very appropriate location for the work he does.  He is a watchman at a mine; he works from 6pm until 7am.  During his time off he likes to engage in commercial activities.  He used to sell charcoal and fish but this turned out to be not very profitable.  One day, while he was walking in the countryside, an old woman gave him a piglet.  He thought the piglet would require a lot of his time so he wasn't too anxious to accept it.  Finally, however, he agreed to raise it.  When the piglet reached the proper weight, he used its meat to prepare \"chicarrones\" (pot-fried pork) and he sold a few portions.  He never imagined that he would become a successful cook and chicarron salesman.  He now raises his own pigs.  Although V\u00edctor was never able to find the old woman who gave him his first pig again, he lives grateful to her for having started him off on his current economic activity.  This is his second loan with MFP and he is very happy with the results of his past investment and for the level of responsibility of his fellow group members.  The funds requested will be used to build a corral that will be adequate to raise his 7 pigs since his goal is to increase the number of animals so that he can have a large chicarron restaurant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":476292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To build a corral for his pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-25T18:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":142.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960266,"comment":null},{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":142.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993110,"comment":null},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":142.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717896,"comment":null},{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":142.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751571,"comment":null},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":142.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934039,"comment":null},{"amount":50.62,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":144.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672792,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-26T00:06:40Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171143,"name":"Margie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margie S. is from the village of Westfield, Iponan, Cagayan de Oro City.

","en":"Amilcar is a humble and hardworking young man of 25. He is single and devotes himself to the care of his 77 year old father.  They both live in their own house located in a cool zone in the mountains of Peru.\r\n<p>\r\nFor five years Amilcar has worked at planting potatoes, peas, and corn, though he hadn\u2019t planned on dedicating himself to agriculture since he wanted to study for a professional career.  The death of his mother made him turn his efforts to the cultivation of his father\u2019s fields.\r\n<p>\r\nAmilcar works on his farm accompanied by a small radio on which he listens to his beloved \u201chuaynos\u201d (traditional music of the mountains).

They consider this activity to be profitable enough.  \r\n\r\nAfter selling their products in the market they are able to cover the family necessities and save.  Nevertheless, what he does not like about his work is not being able to spend much time with his children because he needs to spend as much time as possible working in his fields.  On the other hand, one of the things that satisfies him the most is taking his recently harvested products to his wife.  She cooks them, and his family is the first to savor the crops.  This is recompense for his dedication.\r\n\r\nThis is his sixth loan with MFP.  He is sure that he is progressing, and he wants to ask for more loans later.  At the same time, he wishes to continue working with the members of his communal bank.  They value the work that is done.  To assure a good harvest this season, he will use the money he is asking for to buy a bag of pea seeds, a sack of fertilizer, and a bottle of insecticide to apply to his potato crops.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":476402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy seeds, fertilizer, and insecticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-24T23:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":712.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672808,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-25T00:26:00Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171163,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth A. is from the village of Talakag, Bukidnon.

For the past thirteen years, she has dedicated herself to agriculture, alongside with her husband, planting peas, potatoes, and gladiolus flowers (white and red) on the plots that they both inherited from their parents, who had purchased them themselves.  She also has two donkeys that help her carry her agricultural supplies to her small farm, be it the sowing, cultivating, or harvest season.  Margot considers her work to be quite profitable because with what she was able to save, she was able to buy a vehicle to transport her crops to the market.  \u201cPeas and potatoes are both equally good investments because when they are in season, they both sell at very good prices,\u201d she mentions.  This is the third time that she is seeking a loan from MFP and she continues to promise to be responsible and make punctual payments, just like how the people from her communal bank, where she likes to work, taught her.  She is fairly certain that she will use this money to buy two sacks of pea seeds that will allow her to take advantage of the sowing season that is approaching.     \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":476405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-25T12:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1068.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672810,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-25T13:59:03Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171166,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha tiene 49 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 felizmente casada con Jos\u00e9 Antonio, de 55 a\u00f1os, con quien vive en su casa propia construida a base de madera ubicada en la central selva del Per\u00fa.\n\nDesde hace 8 a\u00f1os, junto a su esposo se dedican al cultivo de pl\u00e1tanos, frutos c\u00edtricos y caf\u00e9.

They have 2 children together: Anthony, who is 7, and Farid, who is 1.  This family lives in their own home located in a remote area in the Peruvian highlands.\r\n\r\nPotatoes, corn, peas and gladiolus flowers are the agricultural products that she has been cultivating for 7 years, with the help of her husband.  They own the land that they cultivate, and they also rent other lands to increase their production.  When she harvests the peas and flowers she must select them for their quality and size, but this is a simple process.  After the harvest she must fertilize with compost to avoid being invaded by pests and to generate the most income when the products are brought to market.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Nimia is thinking of buying more land so that she could avoid having to rent land.  This way she could cultivate in larger quantities to obtain higher earnings to help her get ahead.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP, and she is very happy because she likes to work with the other members of her communal bank, who share her desire to succeed.  With the money that she now requests she will buy 2 sacks of pea seeds, so that she can take advantage of the upcoming planting season.  In addition, she will use the money to buy a sack of fertilizer and a bottle of insecticide.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":476412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"top buy seeds, fertilizers and insecticides                    ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-24T19:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nimia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2565,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672814,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-25T05:29:41Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171171,"name":"Zenaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zenaida R. is from the village of Talakag, Bukidnon.

Their older child went to the capital looking to obtain a higher education.

Currently she is cultivating potatoes, peas, corn and beans on lands that she bought after various years of working.  She works along with her husband, who is in charge of plowing the fields.  What Teodosia likes most is to plant, because she likes to feel the seeds slip from her hand before they are placed in the earth to germinate, and to see the plants grow little by little. In the future she would like to plant in greater quantities, mostly peas, because this product requires the smallest investment.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP, and she expresses that since her first loan she has made notable economic progress.

Red Light is the country's largest market, and is about 10 kilometers from the capital Monrovia.  It is a bustling area full of shops, stalls, and vendor tables.\r\n\r\nOretha is 35 years old and is engaged to be married -- \"I pray to God it will be soon,\" Oretha says of her wedding.  She has four children, two girls and two boys, and also takes care of her mother.  All of her children are in school now; the oldest, a boy, is 20 and in the 11th grade, and the youngest, a 12-year-old girl, is in the 5th grade.\r\n\r\nMany Liberians had their schooling interrupted by years of civil war and conflict, but now that peace has come they are returning to school to finish their studies.  Oretha herself has only been able to complete the 6th grade, and she has no plans to return to school at this time.\r\n\r\nOretha started her business selling lapa, lace, and linen in 2002.  Lapa is patterned, printed African fabric; Oretha is wearing a dress made of lapa in the photo that accompanies this profile.  She says most of the lapa she buys and resells is imported from Togo. She sells from a table at the Red Light market.  Most of her customers are women, but men also buy the lapa she sells.  She says of her business:  \"I take care of it and manage it well.\"  Oretha plans to use her 8,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 37,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more lapa and lace.  \r\n\r\nOretha hopes to be able to grow her business enough so that she can open a proper storefront at the Red Light market.  She also wants to be able to help her children finish their education, \"so they can help me in my old age.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Oretha is the one holding the sign.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCherry is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Cherry owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for her business comes primarily from raising and fattening pigs for sale. Cherry has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for this work.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Cherry joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to make her more capable of engaging in business activities. Cherry has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. The previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise for future sale. Cherry is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be her second loan from ASKI; she will use this loan to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-five branches covering the central and northeastern areas of the Philippines. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

This is also called piggery, which is also the name for the pen where the pigs are kept. In order to keep a business like Ma.

Marlina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the second loan taken out by Marlina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":474588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

A. is a 52-year-old married woman who lives in Prk Cubay, Brgy Guinhalaran, Silay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three trisikads. For those of you that do not know what a trisikad is, allow me to shed some light for you. A trisikad is a typical means of transportation in the Philippines. It is a BMX bike with a small sidecar attached. Inside is a padded seat big enough to fit two (though as many as five people can fit on a trisikad at one time). This is different from a tricycle which is a motorbike with a sidecar attached.\r\n\r\nLeonora owns three trisikads, all of which are used to generate income for her family. Leonora\u2019s husband, Raul, also helps run the business. They have two children ages 21 and 27 years old. The two children work and help the family financially. Leonora wants to buy another trisikad and expand her business. This is a great opportunity for you to help a Kiva borrower expand her business.\r\n\r\nLeonora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in March of 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income, earning an extra 4,800 Philippine pesos (PHP) from her business activities.\r\n\r\nLeonora is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of 14,000 PHP was used to fund the operations of her trisikad business and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is requesting her 17th loan, for 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy a trisikad. Leonora is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

Over the years, she has provided for her family by raising and slaughtering hogs and by selling Avon products in her village.\r\n\r\nThis loan of 28,000 Philippine pesos is for hog fattening, a common business for people in her area suffering from poverty. She will buy ten small piglets, five sacks of feed, and supplements and vitamins for the piglets. She will raise them for approximately four to six months until they are ready for sale.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to have a successful pig farm someday. She believes this opportunity will give her the confidence to succeed while helping her family rise out of poverty. The financial opportunity of hog fattening is one of the best ways to help provide for her family and she very much wants to lift her family out of poverty.

P. is a widowed woman who supports her family by running a pig fattening business. She lives in Sitio Maninihon, Brgy Guinhalaran, Silay City, Negros Occidental with her only child.  He is 30 years old and already has a family of his own.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1988 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her pig fattening business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000.\r\n\r\nZenaida is now borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can expand her business, buying more piglets and more feed. This will be her 26th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

Thus Hou is applying for a loan of $500 to add to her own money to purchase a new motorcycle to replace the old one. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":476790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","use":"To add to her own money to purchase a new motorbike to replace the old one","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Khsach Kandal district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":61,"posted_date":"2010-01-25T07:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123956362,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144747651,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:34:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159669582,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166931824,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:23:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172150331,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177445266,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182584396,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-25T10:30:32Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:53:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171259,"name":"Avelcan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Avelcan M. is from the village of Sicayab.

Emma is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan Emma has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She is 45 years old. Vilma is the group leader of an eight-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nVilma is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Vilma owns and operates a business of selling dried fish and vegetables in the market. Aside from that, she also has a hog-raising business. Vilma has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $88 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Vilma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Vilma is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase some hog feed. This will be her 3rd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 45 years old. Estrelita is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nEstrelita is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Estrelita owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Estrelita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately PHP 5,000 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Estrelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Estrelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of PHP 25,000 from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Estrelita is requesting a new loan of PHP 15,000, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Estrelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

To make a living, Manuel owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and for sale. Manuel has been engaged in his business for over 8 years and earns approximately PHP 3,000 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Manuel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Manuel is requesting a new loan of PHP 6,000, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Manuel from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay his child's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 4,500 per month.\r\n\r\nConcepcion has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than three years now. She regularly attends the weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow nine times from CCT\u2019s cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy added fish stock for her business.\r\n\r\nNow, with your help, Concepcion would like to apply for a PHP 16,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying more dried fish to sell.

His mother receives 54,000 tugrugs (about $38) of allowances per month, which is too low for a living. \r\n\r\nGundsambuu operates a wooden product making business with the help of his younger brother in his town. He started his business in 2007 after his high school graduation. He made his decision based on his difficult life of taking care of his mother and paying for his brothers' education. He makes all kinds of furniture using black wood and cedar wood, which makes the wooden products very strong and hard. In 2009 he began to operate his own wooden product making business using his tools purchased from China. \r\n\r\nHe has been quite successful in conducting his business and has established a strong customer base. He is very hardworking and always looks for ways to grow his business. With his business earnings, he was able to buy a new cover for his ger, which enabled his home to be more warm than before. For the future, Altansukh plans to expand and improve his business in order to have enough treatment money for his mother. He truly wants his mother to stand by using a walking stick.  \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a 500,000 tugrug loan to purchase cedar wood and other materials used to make his products.

This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying pork and other meats from wholesale butchers.\r\n\r\nPaz dreams that her business will continue to improve with more loyal customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shirley M. is from the village of Bantay, Solana, Cagayan. She is 44 years old. Shirley is the group leader of a 10-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nShirley is married and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, Shirley owns & operates a business in the agriculture sector raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Shirley has been in her business for over one year and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Shirley joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Shirley has successfully repaid her previous loan from ASKI. Shirley is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

F., 52, is making sure that her family has adequate provision for their daily needs.

She has been managing their own computer shop, while selling ready-to-wear garments and bed sheets on the side.\r\n\r\nNerry has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends the weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow seven times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.\r\n\r\nNerry is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy things that her businesses need. Her three businesses let her earn a net profit of PHP 4,700 per month.\r\n\r\nNow, with your help, Nerry would like to obtain a PHP 16,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding businesses by buying computer-related equipment plus clothes for her ready-to-wear business.\r\n\r\nNerry dreams that her businesses will grow and that someday she can have a shop in a mall to attract more customers and generate more income.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":476914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"To buy

She also manages a junkshop.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding businesses by buying more fish products and added funds for her junkshop.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that she could see the lives of her children be far better than what they have experienced as they help each other in times of need. \r\n\r\nJulia has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than four years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow 10 times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy stocks of fish to her store. Her businesses help her earn a combined profit of PHP 9,900 per month.  \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Having repaid their first loan without incident, they are on their second group loan, which will be used to buy: a bag of rice, two bags of cabbages, 20kg of garlic, two bags of onions (shallots), a box of tea, ten packets of sweets, 15 packets of chocolate and 25 kg of sugar. They buy their stock locally at the weekly fair in Cinzana Gare. The products are sold on for cash or credit on the spot in the same market and also at home to a customer base made up of men, women and children. \r\n\r\nThey hope to make an average monthly profit of 13,250 FCFA, which will be used for the children's healthcare and to reinvest in their revenue generating activities. Their ambition is to buy agricultural equipment. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":476985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of various products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-25T13:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Tata                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assanatou            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Astan        Foun\u00e8  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Ami                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":17377.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991366,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":17377.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021640,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":17377.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746430,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":17377.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778966,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:04Z","rounded_local_amount":17377.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961177,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":16666.65,"processed_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:24Z","rounded_local_amount":17377.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699341,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-25T13:35:18Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171388,"name":"Precila's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Precila B. is from the village of Awallan, Baggao, Cagayan.

T., 42, is married to Gabriel T. who drives a jeepney, a small bus used for local transportation. They are blessed with four children. She has been selling beauty products and adding to the family\u2019s income for the past three years so that the family can have a better life. \r\n<p>\r\nMilagros has been a member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) for more than four years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment record, she was able to take out eight previous loans from CCT\u2019s Cooperative to buy assorted beauty products. Her business brings her a profit of 1,500 PHP per month while her husband earns 5,000 PHP from driving the jeepney. \r\n<p>\r\nNow she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan as a source for added capital for her expanding business. With it she would buy a spare wheel and crude oil for their jeep plus additional soap products for her beauty product business. She dreams that they will be able to save enough money so that their children can finish their studies and enter Bible School someday.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout CCT:\r\n<p>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical missionary work in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ. CCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n<p>\r\nLocally, all CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":476952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nMarites is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Marites owns and operates a general store. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Marites has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Marites joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Marites is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her range of products offered. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Marites from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by the business to improve and expand the business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs. \r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rahimdjon leases farmland for a season at a time, since he does not own land. He cultivates his crops and then sells them, but his profits are decreased by the land payments. Therefore, Rahimdjon wishes to quickly acquire his own land, where he can sow his crops calmly and increase the amount of revenue that he brings home. To make that a reality, he needs to increase his production and especially the quality of his products to make them more profitable in the marketplace. This will bring better profits and he will then be able to acquire a plot of land. The amount required by Rahimdjon at the moment is $1200 USD for the purchase of fuels and lubricants, seeds and mineral fertilizer.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.

She learned this trade from one of her acquaintances. After weeks of apprenticeship, she finally mastered the production technique and started her own business. She has been pursuing this activity for the past four years and has acquired a high reputation due to the quality of her traditional soaps.\r\n\r\nTo make traditional soap she heats 50 litres of Shea oil in a large pot or in a barrel. She then adds five 20-litre containers of water, five kilos of flour and four kilos of caustic soda. She then stirs with a large ladle until she obtains a paste-like consistency from which she will make the soap.\r\n\r\nTo increase the size of her business and to generate more revenue, she approached Soro Yiriwaso four years ago. Folllowing four group and two individual loans, all of which were fully reimbursed, she is now requesting a third individual loan. She will use this loan to purchase 30 barrels of caustic soda. She gets her supplies locally. Mrs. Binton Traor\u00e9 sells cash and on credit to a customer base of women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she hopes to reach a monthly revenue of 100,000 FCFA. This will enable her to assist her husband and participate in the funding of social events (baptisms, weddings, etc.).\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":477011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"Buy caustic soda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-25T15:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-18T08:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":46339.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021642,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":46339.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746432,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":46339.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778968,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":46339.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961179,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":46339.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699343,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":46339.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913278,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":46339.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180473,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":46339.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476522,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":46339.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613317,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":46339.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751806,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":45454.5,"processed_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":46339.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606048,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-01-25T17:05:39Z","paid_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":171410,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine is 60 years old and is married with two children.

For the last 5 years he has worked as a field hand in the area's farming lands.  He usually works on asparagus crops.  He tells us that this is the only source of income for his family so he works very hard every day in order to get ahead.  On the other hand, he augments his family income raising animals; he raises pigs and cows for subsequent sale to merchants that frequent the area where he lives.  Reinario is asking Edpyme Alternativa for 400 new soles to be used in home improvement.

In order to get to the community, there is a detour off the highway over 8 km. of rough dirt track, barely usable during the rainy season, before arriving at the main town.  She is 29, married with 3 children of 8, 4, and 7 months.  For the last 3 years she has been selling fresh cheeses that she makes herself with milk that she buys from small dairies in the area.  She also has had a grocery shop for a short while, and she would like to enlarge her business.  Although she is married, her husband gives her very little towards expenses since he works at subsistence-level agriculture.  Therefore she needs to sell more to generate more income to improve the economic situation of her family.  Among other necessities is the purchase of a cheese press in order to diversify her products to sell pressed cheeses, since currently she only sells fresh cheese.  If she continues to qualify for more credit, she will be able to buy this machine with the next loan.  Before requesting a loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, she was working through a savings bank, but because of bad service she decided to change to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  For this she had to form a group of 12 persons, each with their own economic activity.

She works daily as a cleaning lady in various homes in the area but six months ago she found an occupation that she likes a lot and that she can do in her spare time.  She makes all kinds of accessories for women like:  earrings, necklaces and bracelets.  She makes them with various kinds of stones which she buys at wholesale.  Her children then help her sort them, which allows her to move ahead faster.  She works in partnership with a friend, who's job it is to go out and sell the completed pieces.  Both her jobs produce needed profits which, together with her husband's earnings, pay for household expenses and education costs of the children.  For the future, Carmen would like to start to sell her accessories independently because she figures her profits would be higher that way.  This is her first loan with MFP and she promisses to be punctual with her payments because she is already planning to request future loans.  Carmen intends to use the funds to buy supplies to continue to make her accessories and to start to become independent.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

El es consciente de que si quiere ver a su familia progresar tiene que dar todo de si para sacarlos adelante. El continuo uso otorgado a su veh\u00edculo ha hecho que presenta algunas fallas que requieran de reparacion urgente, por ello se encuentra solcitando a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 800 nuevos soles.\n\nElvis es un padre honrado, empe\u00f1oso y trabajador.

It is located three hours from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has worked transporting cargo and passengers in his \u201cmototaxi\u201d (three wheeled motorized vehicle) for ten years.  He tells us that he started by renting mototaxis.  Four years ago he was able to get his own with his savings.  He usually works within the city, although at times he also works routes that run from the city to the neighboring areas.\r\n\r\nHe sometimes works as a workman.  He is aware of the fact that if he wants to see his family progress, he needs to give all of himself to get them ahead.  The continual use of his vehicle has caused some defects that need to be repaired urgently.  That is why he is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a loan for 800 PEN.\r\n\r\nElvis is an honest and hard-working father.

Together with her husband, she runs a small school cafeteria as well as a small eatery in their home where she sells a variety of dishes.  She has worked for 28 years to support her family.  When she began, it was with little capital.  However, with time, she used savings from her profits and financing to invest more in her meals sales at home.  \r\n\r\nIt's her children who run the operation when they get home from school; this way they all help each other out and work together since she and her husband are at the school cafeteria.  She is requesting financing to buy sweets, soft-drinks, pastry, rice, meat, chicken, fruits and vegetables in order to prepare the meals as well as the items she prepare for the teachers' breaks.  She makes tacos, vigoron (chopped cabbage; chimichurri: tomatoes, onions, garlic and cilantro pickled in lime juice; boiled yucca and chicharrones-fried pork skins and\/or fried pork meat), enchiladas, among others.  \r\n\r\nShe is a woman who is dedicated to work; even on weekends she makes nacatamales (typical Nicaraguan tamales) to earn still more income since one of her sons is in university and spends a lot and she wants to support him since she did not have the opportunity to study because her parents were very poor.
