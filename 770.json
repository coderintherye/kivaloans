\n","en":"Irina was born in 1969 in a simple family of a bus driver. Her mother worked as a construction site foreperson. After graduating from college in 1988, Irina found a job as a weaver at the Karabaltinsky carpet factory. In 1991 she met her husband and in 1992 gave birth to her daughter. After ten years of marriage, Irina again became single. In 2002, while looking for a source of income for her small family, Irina began selling men's and women's clothing at the market in the village of Kaindy, using 6000 som (KGS) as her starting capital. Since the trade was not very profitable, Irina sold off her inventory and from 2006 to 2007 worked as a saleswoman in retail.\r\n\r\nAs her next step, Irina decided to lease a nearby shop that sells detergents, soaps, and cosmetics. Thanks to her tenacity, persistence, and daily work, Irina was able to develop her business, using the profits to buy an apartment in the village. In order to expand the range of her products, Irina has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS). Irina plans to use the profits from this loan to finance her daughter's college education.

She studied art at the University of New Orleans and New Orleans Academy of Fine Arts.  She has done set dressing for major motion pictures, has been a stylist for Mattel Toys, has done music video styling and has been a scenic artist for all of New Orleans local theaters.   \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Michelle started Mondo Murals & Design, LLC.  She's been painting specialty murals in businesses and private homes.  She also has many fine art paintings for sale in several galleries in the French Quarter of New Orleans.  Michelle is now branching out and printing her art on home decor and gift ware items. With her Kiva loan, Michelle will be able to reproduce her art on mugs, aprons, matted prints, coasters, trivets and other items.  To view some of Michelle's work go to www.mondomurals.com.\r\n\r\nOn Mardi Gras day, Michelle can be found winding her way from Uptown to the French Quarter with \"Mondo Kayo Social & Marching Club,\" a New Orleans salute to Carnival across the tropics. Revelers in colorful handmade costumes dance to Caribbean, Latin and African beats blaring from tiki floats. Michelle enjoys Mondo Kayo so much that she named her business Mondo Murals & Design after it.  Mondo means \"world,\" and Michelle's goal is to paint her murals all over the

","en":"Natalya is 51 years old.  She works as an economic development specialist at the local administration office.  In 1996, in search of an additional source of income for her family, Natalya started her animal husbandry business with an initial sum of 6,000 som (KGS).

She grows vegetables in a greenhouse for future wholesale. She owns 4 large greenhouses and another 2 in seedlings. She has been cultivating vegetables for 12 years now. She has invested around 100,000 hryvnia in the farm. The cost of seeds and sheeting cost up to 30,000 hryvnia a year. \r\n\r\nNadezhda plans to use a Kiva loan of 20,000 hryvnia to consistently grow her business and buy seeds, sheeting and fertilizers.

She's been doing this work ever since she stopped working as an employee of a company.  She took her severance pay, and gradually invested it in fabric to make decorative items for babies.  She makes crib canopies, crib bedding and baby accessories by hand, which are commissioned by her friends.  This has allowed her to gradually make profits, so that she could buy a sewing machine and give herself the task of acquiring customers who will buy the products that she makes and designs, either on a cash or credit basis.

His annual expenditures on seeds and plastic greenhouse covering amount to 35,000 hryvnia. Now he needs 20,000 hryvnia to purchase new plastic covering and other materials for the greenhouses.

She is 65 years old and lives with her husband, 72-year-old Vakhtang. Nezhno purchases cosmetics from a wholesaler and then sells them in the village. The family's total average monthly income, including pensions, is 340 GEL. \r\n\r\nAccording to the Credo poverty score card, Nezhno belongs to the vulnerable poor group, people who have few, if any, assets. They have very limited chances to earn money. Nezhno applied for a Kiva loan within the parameters of the start-up program.

The oldest has a family of his own.  Marcelino lives with his wife, children and daughter-in-law in a house that he owns in Zona Patria, a rual town in Chanchamayo province.  Marcelino is a happy, optimistic man, qualities that he applies to his work.  He learned farming as a boy and it's now his main source of income and his means of supporting his family.  He owns 6 hectares [about 15 acres] of land, 4 of which he's set aside for growing coffe and platanos.  His last harvest yielded 32 sacks of [dropped word--probably coffee] which he sold at a good price.  Each platanos crop yields 40 to 50 \"arrobas\" [a unit of weight equal to somewhere between 11 and 16 pounds, depending on the region] of platanos which he can sell locally for 4 soles per arroba.  He says that he couuld make more for his crop in the city, but he sells at a local market because the extra amount that he can make in the city isn't enough to cover the related transportation expenses.  Farming is hard work and he relies on his children to help him sow, tend, fertilize and harvest his fields.  Marcelino is applying for this, his 7th, MFP loan and says that he is committed to repaying it on time.  He is happy with his community bank, Mujeres al futuro.  \r\nHe will use part of this loan to buy organic manure for his next coffee crop and the rest to pay for day laborers who he will pay 25 soles for each 8-hour day."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":988477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to hire day laborers for his farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-24T21:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-23T21:00:05Z","loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T21:50:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":384581,"name":"Anush","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anush, who was born in 1963, lives in Sevan with her husband, two sons and a daughter-in-law.

Early every morning, he and his wife get up and begin the process of grinding corn to prepare their delicious rolls, filled with cheese and with corn. They also supervise and work with one employee in the food stall, where they sell arepas (a filled cornbread) of eggs, sweets, or cheee, carima\u00f1olas (a stuffed fritter made from yucca), coffee with milk, and cold soft drinks, so that their customers, however early they pass through the door of their business, are attracted by the cases full of fresh products for consumption that they sell there for breakfast. Eduardo and his wife began their business 10 years ago, offering small quantities of fried food and coffee to the community in general, in a little sales area in their house. Joining their efforts and their work discipline, their business grew and their capital increased until they were able to offer complete breakfasts, and then they reached the point where they could sell beverages and natural fruits juices from their region in a room that was adequate to tend to their customers. Their dream is to expand and make their business independent until they are able to have a big restaurant, but the business needs to grow in market, and their working capital is insufficient to do it alone. This is the reason why they have turned to a Kiva loan, the first financing that they have had at Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which they will buy corn, coffee, oil, powdered milk, cheese, meats, and eggs in larger proportion, so that they can start increasing the products they offer and begin to negotiate with shops around their neighborhood.

They care for their only child, age 14, in their own home in the Cumutay annex, Husahuasi district. Roxana works in agriculture. She has a strong, persistent character; because of this, she runs her farm with great energy. She sows \u201c\u00fanica\u201d potatoes, peas, and some flowers such as gladiolas. \"Every year I harvest 200 bags of potatoes\", she says. The potato business in Huasahuasi never results in loss. For this reason, Huasahuasi is considered the potato capital of the country.\r\nRoxana also tells us that pea cultivation also brings in a considerable income. She harvests 35 to 40 bags of peas from every bag of seeds that she plants. She sells each bag for 60 soles at the moment, but there are times that the price rises up to 120 soles.\r\nJos\u00e9 Luis works as a driller in a construction company. Roxana is happy, feels that things are going very well, and hopes that they will continue to do so. For now, she will keep on planting. This will be her tenth loan with MFP, so she hopes for your help in continuing with her goals. She promises to be punctual with the payment of her quotas. She also says that she is comfortable with her communal bank, \u201cLos Pioneros de Cumutay\u201d, because of their teamwork. She will invest this loan in the purchase of 5 bags of pea seeds. With what is left over, she will pay the day labourers whom she will hire for the planting."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":988518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy five bags of pea seeds and to hire day labourers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-24T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-23T23:00:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-25T21:24:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":384589,"name":"Gideon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gideon has operated his retail shop in Nakuru town for the last three years.

He parents were simple workers.   After she finished school, Elmira helped her family around the house.  At the time she could only dream about further education as the money her parents earned was enough only for food.  The family's main source of income was growing beets, and from her childhood Elmira has a great deal of experience in working with domesticated animals and in growing field crops. \r\n\r\nAfter she married, Elmira and her husband made their home in a tiny shack on the edge of their village and grew beets on 1\/10 ha (about 1\/4 acre) of land.  Their young family made it through many troubles and, and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, endured difficult years.  There was no work in the village and at that time Elmira and her husband were raising five children and had two dairy cows.   Besides their own children, Elmira and her husband helped their parents' families where they had younger brothers and sisters.  \r\n\r\nThanks to Elmira's perseverance and persistence, today she has two dairy cows and two young bulls.  The sale of milk allows her to earn about 3,000 som (KGS) per month.  With the goal of further developing her business, Elmira turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy additional cattle.  She plans to invest the income in further increasing her herd and to make her dream of building a small farm come true. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":991353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Panfilovskoe village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-25T05:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-24T05:40:02Z","loan_amount":2150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":752.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":752.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2012-01-25T21:10:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":383205,"name":"Alcira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Alcira Raquel es una mujer trabajadora y emprendedora de 36 a\u00f1os quien se dedica al comercio de pollo.

She is married to Bejamine, a vendor, and is a mother of five children. She and her husband share responsibility in attending to their young children while at the same time earning an income for their daily needs. \r\n\r\nDarlyn is a Balut vendor. In the Philippines, Balut is a well-known egg that is sold on the sidewalk. It is a fertilized duck egg that has not been hatched. Instead it is cooked as a boiled egg with a delicious small amount of soup inside. It is a highly nutritious food that Filipinos love to eat, especially when they feel tired, as it revitalizes their energy and strength. About 450-600 Balut eggs are boiled and sold every night. She and her husband do the selling to lessen expenses of paying commissions to vendors that will sell the eggs. They earn about 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales per day.  \r\n\r\nDarlyn is requesting a loan amounting to Php 12,000 that she will use as start-up capital for her additional business, which is selling quail eggs and fried chicken skin. The remaining amount will be spent on purchasing additional Balut eggs. There is a high demand for fried chicken skin, and she wants to give it a try since her stall is located in a crowded and busy area. \r\n\r\nDarlyn dreams of having a stall located in the market. She still has to wait a little bit more to make this come true because she has to prioritize being a mother to her young children. For now, Darlyn and her husband will just continue to lean on each other to make their small business grow for the sake of their children\u2019s future. Darlyn never fails to attend weekly fellowship* meetings as they inspire her to go on with their life no matter what the obstacles are, because she has a big God Who will never fail her. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

With the 3000 PEN that she is applying for, she will buy more chickens to better cover the demands of her customers and to continue selling at her stall.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":343.37,"image":{"id":988822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","use":"to buy more chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-25T16:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-24T16:50:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cadith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":461.29},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":454.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":495.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":513.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":522.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":552.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.98},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.72},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.08},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":172.98,"local_amount":461.29,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":465.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246310,"comment":null},{"amount":170.39,"local_amount":454.37,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":458.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386322,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-25T20:55:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}}]}
