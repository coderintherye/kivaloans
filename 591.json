He says that he feels happy to have formed a united family.  Mateo is married to 48 year-old Elva, with whom he has three children.  Only 21 year-old Mayner still lives with them in their home, which they own.  They live in the small village of Huaylahuichan.\r\n\r\nIn common with every man, Mateo has had to face difficulties in life.  He remembers that, in order to pay for his children's education, he used to take the small amount of produce that he grew and sell it straight away.  He almost didn't earn enough until, 30 years ago, he and his wife bought large stretches of land.  This is where he currently grows corn, peas, alfalfa and potatoes.  This purchase allowed him to make more income which he used to buy more land.  He built his own home and now lives comfortably.\r\n\r\nMateo admires his wife Elva because she is the great manager behind all of their achievements.  \"She is an entrepreneurial and determined woman who knew how to make good use of the money that came into our hands\", he says.  For this reason, he is not afraid to admit that his wife is the one who manages all the money that he earns.  Mateo is looking for relaxation in his life.  He is always saving up so that he can build lodgings in the future where he can serve his customers and make income without so much effort.  He is preparing for his future when he will not have the same strength to work the land.\r\n\r\nMateo is a member of the \"Nueva Esperanza\" (New Hope) community bank and this is his seventh loan from MFP.  He is certain that he will access future loans because he says that his savings, his punctual loan repayments, and the active work that he carries out as a member of his community bank guarantee him as a responsible person.\r\n\r\nMateo will invest the loan he has requested in paying for seven hectares of farmland as he will rent out the land that he already owns at a higher price and thereby make a bit of extra money.  He plans to use this to buy corn seed and organic fertilizer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":764269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to rent seven hectares of land to farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-06T23:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mateo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3033.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666076,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-17T06:01:01Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":296102,"name":"Abraham","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Abraham tiene 29 a\u00f1os de edad el estudio una carrera t\u00e9cnica y dice que ya no continuo con sus estudios por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos, el esta casado con la se\u00f1ora Jessica la cual le ayuda a atender la tienda de bisuter\u00eda y regalos, ellos tienen dos ni\u00f1as una de 5 a\u00f1os la cual estudia el preescolar y la menor de dos a\u00f1os.

She separated from her partner many years ago, with whom she has a son that already has his own home. That is why she lives alone in her own home, located on a farmhouse of Huaylahuichan. Despite her age and living alone, she still has goals to achieve, because the driving force of her life is her son and because she loves the land that saw her be born and grow up. \"I grew up here eating corn, boiled potatoes, and dirt. I can't get accustomed to another place, because the noise of the city bothers me and you always have to eat there,\" says Juana, who cultivates corn, potatoes, and peas on the land that she inherited from her parents. She works alone. What she likes the most is to plant alfalfa because after cutting it down, it sprouts up to four times and can last three years with a good output. \"You have to water them once a week,\" she comments. At the same time, she raises 150 guinea pigs in her dwelling. She sells them mostly to be consumed (meat) and to be produced (raised). According to her, she says that this time she sold a good quantity of them so that she could pay her bills. Since her activities are fairly profitable, she is thinking about living with her grandson Marco, who is 15 years old. That is why she plans to focus on the business of selling alfalfa and guinea pigs--she wants to support him with the costs of his studies. Now she is recuperating from the loss that she had in the pea harvest. She sold them below price because they were ruined by changes in the climate. She belongs to the communal bank \"Nueva esperanza\" [\"New Hope\"]. This is the 7th loan with MFP where she expresses, \"I didn't trust another entity, because they offer us benefits and in the end don't follow through. Besides, they don't worry about you like this institution, where I am happy working in my communal bank.\" Juana will prepare the land for the next planting of alfalfa. The roots of her crop were ruined, therefore, they didn't sprout in the adequate size. She will buy seeds of the same kind, as well as natural fertilizers so that they grow adequately. And if money remains, she will buy medium-sized female and male guinea pigs, to ensure their reproduction."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":764276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy alfalfa seeds, fertilizers and guinea pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-07T00:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2045.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666077,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-05-07T02:58:55Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":296107,"name":"Carmela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carmela es una madre D. familia D. 51 a\u00f1os D. edad, vive con sus 3 hijos y esposo en su casa propia la cual cuenta con los servicios b\u00e1sicos D. agua y luz, en donD. acondicionado la su sala un lugar para colocar su tienda, ubicado en la zona rural D. la campi\u00f1a  La Arenita a unos 15 minutos del distrito D.

She is 54 years old and married.\r\nIsabel owns a corner shop where she sells groceries.  She will use this loan to buy the merchandise she needs to stock her business.  She and her husband operate the store in the Peruvian province of Vilcas Huaman.  Among other things, they sell rice, sugar, pasta, flour, eggs, bottled water, fruits, vegetables, meat and chicken.  They also have a farm where they grow maize, wheat, barley, beans, etc.  After their harvest, they carry their crop to Ayacucho for sale in the markets there.  \r\nIsabel joined FINCA Peru when a friend invited her to join.  She likes the community bank because it provides a source of credit that has helped her business and allowed her to save.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He is 52 years old. Nelson is married and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, Nelson owns and operates a business venture in the services sector providing waste management services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating tricycle transport services. Nelson has been engaged in his business for over 11 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Nelson joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nelson is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to repair existing vehicle for better service. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Nelson from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She had no savings, owing to the fact that she had no job before.

Rosa is well-informed about different events that take place near her home, so she takes advantage of these festival days to generate sales.  She is full of energy and does not hesitate to travel to different places where festivals, fairs, soccer games, concerts, and other events are taking place so that she can set up her business.  As a result, her sales have increased.  \n\nBeing an enterprising woman, Rosa wants to increase her level of sales.  For this reason, she needs to have a variety of beverages to offer to her customers at different events they attend.  This led her to request a loan so that she can buy a variety of beverages such as sodas, juices, water, iced teas, and other drinks that are in demand among her customers.  By working in this manner, she hopes to generate more income to help improve her quality of life and that of her family.
