A. is 41 years old, married and a father with six children. Right now all his children are in a community school in the town where he lives. Samuel lives in a farming community called Abofour, a suburb of Offinso in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Abofour is a forest reserve area and the most popular occupation is farming. Most of the people are farmers and the illiteracy rate there is very high among the adults. \r\n\r\nSamuel is a seasoned farmer and he has been farming cocoa and cereals like maize for more than twelve years, to take care of his family. Through this, he has managed to build a two bed room house in the village.

Esperanza overcame a number of difficult circumstances in establishing her store, including the hard work for someone of her age and starting with very few products. Esperanza opened the store with only: basic grains, ice, and sweets. In spite of this, she was able to capture the attention of her clients and establish her business. \r\n\r\nThis loan is for working capital so that Esperanza can buy her products from a variety of distributors. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":263728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T15:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9800,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":816.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":837.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400031,"comment":null},{"amount":65.76,"local_amount":1288.98,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1322.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092029,"comment":null},{"amount":17.56,"local_amount":344.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":353.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985412,"comment":null},{"amount":43.39,"local_amount":850.51,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:52Z","rounded_local_amount":872.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446027,"comment":null},{"amount":189.22,"local_amount":3708.73,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3804.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956666,"comment":null},{"amount":142.4,"local_amount":2790.75,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2862.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948002,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

C. is 29 years old and married. Kenneth has three children. His son is 10 years old and in the fourth grade. His daughter is three years old and not yet in school, and his second son is 1 year old and not yet in school. Kenneth's wife works as a nurse. Kenneth would like to maintain his business, as it is the only means he has of supporting his family, and not all young people work in this type of business. He dreams of increasing production of suit designs to expand his client base. That way he would be able to achieve innovation in the market and his products would not only be recommended by people in this country but also be envied by foreigners. This would provide Kenneth with more earnings. He would like to buy more machines in order to give jobs to people who would truly like to get ahead and provide a measure of stability for their families, as the majority of families today are supported by women.\r\n\r\nKenneth is a tailor, working from his home and also traveling through town. He has been in this business for 10 years, having started when he was 19 years old. At the time he didn't have a job and needed income urgently in order to support his family. He therefore offered his services as a tailor, initially making suits for children, women, and men. He was able to support himself because his neighbors kept returning to his store.Kenneth gained fame because he as able to show off the affluence of his clients. Kenneth decided to invest his earnings as working capital and he had experiences that changed his perspective on life.\r\n\r\nHis loan will be used as working capital to buy materials such as: clothing, needles, thread, and scissors. Above all, Kenneth would like to buy cloth for uniforms, as the school year is approaching.

She is single and does not have children.  Her goals are to continue providing this source of income that she makes through her work.  While she is young, she thinks about the future because, with the passage of time, she will be able to reach her proposed goals.  Her dreams are to permanently establish her business in a place where she can comfortably offer her customers her products.  Her hope is that she will have a clothing store where her customers find everything they are looking for and, in that way, she will be able to satisfy the different tastes her customers have.  In addition to these hopes, it is her desire to please her mother because she is the one who proudly bears the costs of the household which has helped her to mature to withstand the challenges in life.\r\n  \r\nKarla sells clothing as a street vendor.  She has had her business for 6 years.  This young woman, Karla, started her business because of a need to provide another source of income for her home since her salary was not adjustable.  It was for this that she decided to sell cosmetics and clothes, offering payment by credit or cash, to her co-workers and friends, including her classmates.  She counted on the support of her cousin who has worked in this business and who provided her with products that she would later pay her back for after getting paid herself.

Carlos has 2 children, his oldest son is 18 years old and is in his fourth year of high school and his youngest son is 10 years old and is in his fourth year of primary school.  His goals are to show the quality of his cattle since this is what will increase his prestige.  His dream is to expand his business to be able to earn more for his family and to provide more stability to his children now that they are in a stage when it is necessary to prepare for the future.  He hopes to buy land for his children so that they do not have difficulties in the future and for them to know how difficult it is to work and so that they become interested in the business which would be a benefit to them and also a way of working.<p>\r\n \r\n\r\nHe purchases and sells large and small livestock.  His business is located in his home.  He has had this business for five years.  Don Carlos started his business with the goal of meeting his household expenses.  It is important to highlight that Don Carlos is a farmer who decided to start in this business since it was not easy to survive the situation with his wife.  Despite this, he resorted to the different regions in search of livestock for sale so that he could make offers to buy.  For this reason, it was not difficult for him to learn this type of business.  He was interested in the selling of pigs which also benefited him.  The financing is for business capital that he needs to buy different animals, cattle as well as pigs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joanna Silverman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":263752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Business Capital ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-30T23:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":909.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400035,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:35:03Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092033,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985416,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446031,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956670,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174092,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599707,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035598,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948004,"comment":null},{"amount":45.45,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":913.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789978,"comment":null},{"amount":45.5,"local_amount":909.1,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":913.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680672,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-31T07:10:39Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:31:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86659,"name":"Fransisico Javier","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Francisco Javier M.

Don Francisco has two children, his oldest son is 12 years old and is in his fifth year of elementary school and his daughter is three years of age and is not yet in school.  His partner in life works on her own.  His goals are to increase his business now that he is focused in the progress of his business.  He hopes to get another urban route to secure the future of his children and wife so that, one day, his children can be in charge of the business and will have the experience necessary to manage all of the situations that present themselves.  He dreams to expand his transportation services so that he has a larger clientele and to support his family since this could be one of the ways for his income to cover the household expenses.  <p>  \r\n\r\nHe is a transportation provider offering his services as a street vendor.  He has had this business for 4 years.  Don Francisco started this business with a used vehicle.  He started using this vehicle once he had all of his papers in order and completed the process to allow his vehicle to travel throughout the streets.  It has not been easy to do.  To acquire this vehicle, Don Francisco had to ask his family for a loan and, with his earnings, he has been able to pay back the debt little by little.  He thanks God for having decent and humble work to support his family.  The loan is for business capital since he needs the services of a mechanic to repair certain parts of his vehicle.  Now that he travels in rural areas it is necessary to constantly check the vehicle to ensure the safety of his customers.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joanna Silverman, Kiva

H. is 43 years old and married.  She has two children, a 15-year old son in high school and a 10-year old son in elementary school.  Her husband is a factory worker.  Her goal is to keep the business going because her family's income depends on it.  She wants, in the future, to give each of her children a house where they can live with their families so that they can be both independent and secure.  She also wants to make improvements to her house because she would like her family to be comfortable and safe, free of the problems they have during the rainy season.  \r\n<p>\r\nMercedes makes a living selling general merchandise: footwear, clothing and cosmetics.  She is a street vendor and has operated her business for 3 years.  Like many small businesses, she started out selling a single product, cosmetics, and then added other products, such as footwear, as she built a base of customers.  Her customers like the service that she provides and look to her for new products.  That's how she got the idea to sell clothing, a product that will help her to help her family, a responsibility that she feels deeply.  Selling clothes requires a lot of effort, though.  The loan will be used for working capital so that Mercedes can buy uniforms and footwear appropriate for the upcoming school year.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

Sebelumnya, Ni Made Rani hanya memelihara satu babi penggemukkan dan hanya diberi pakan tradisional yang berupa dedaunan dan sisa makanan di dapur. Hal seperti itu menyebabkan pertumbuhan babi tidak optimal dan tentunya berpengaruh terhadap harga jual. Setelah mendapat pembinaan dan pinjaman modal, sekarang Ni Made Rani memelihara 4 ekor babi yang dipisah dalam dua kandang. Hal itu dilakukannya untuk memudahkan perawatan dan pembersihan kandang. Pinjaman itu digunakan juga untuk membeli pakan yang berkwalitas sehingga sekarang pertumbuhan babinya pesat dan sehat. Dengan adanya perubahan cara beternak, hal ini berpengaruh terhadap pendapatan keluarganya, karena sekarang ia dapat menjual babinya dengan harga yang lebih tinggi.","en":"Ni Made Rani and her husband has one toddler.

daerah tempat  tinggalnya belum ada  usaha warung yang  menjadi saingan dalam usahanya. Barang yang dijual pun beraneka macam seperti makanan ringan dan kebutuhan pokok setiap hari bahkan sayur mayur.Setiap hari Ni Komang Sukra Ratmini membuka warung pada pukul 07.00 wita dan tutup pada pukul 18.00 wita. Karena warung ada didepan rumahnya, maka jika tidak ada pelanggan yang berbelanja Ni Komang Sukra Ratmini bisa melakukan pekerjaan rumah tangga lainnya. Dalam menjalankan usaha ini Ni Komang Sukra Ratmini membutuhkan  dana untuk menambah usaha warungnya karena pelanggannya banyak sedangkan modal yang dimiliki sangat terbatas. Disamping melayani konsumen secara individu untuk kepentingan sendiri, Ni Komang Sukra Ratmini juga menjadi suplyer bagi para pedagang yang lain yang lebih kecil karena modal yang mereka miliki sangat kecil dan terbatas. Sekarang setelah Ni Komang Sukra Ratmini mendapat tambahan modal ia dapat melayani para konsumen lebih banyak lagi dengan keuntungan bersih perhari  mencapai Rp.150.000,- yang dulunya hanya memperoleh keuntungan bersih perhari Rp 50.000. Usaha warung ini ditekuninya dengan harapan  kedepannya usaha warung dapat lebih meningkat dan menjadi lebih besar lagi dari sekarang.","en":"Ni Komang Sukra Ratmini opens a small stall in front of her house.

She opens the stall from 7 am to 6 pm everyday. As she has the stall in her house so she still can do the daily house chores. <p>\r\nShe needs additional working capital as her customers are increasing so she needs to stock up more merchandises.

She has a big family, but does not care for any additional family members. \r\n<p>\r\nRobinah rents a one-room house where she lives with five people. They have electricity, but no piped water. The family eats three meals a day. \r\n<p>\r\nRobinah works in a semi-urban area, which is on the outskirts of Kampala. To earn a living, she sells fish in Namungoona, which is one of the city suburbs. She works seven days a week and uses public transportation to facilitate her business transport needs. She buys fish from Gaba, one of the landing sites near Kampala City. She travels to Gaba twice a week to buy the fish. Robinah sells to an average of 20 customers a day. She has many different types of customers. \r\n<p>\r\nRobinah faces many challenges in her business. During the rainy season it is difficult to transport the fish from Gaba, which means she sometimes cannot sell to her customers. Also, she must contend with the fluctuations in fish prices; sometimes she buys them when they are very expensive. She has been in this business for the last five years and has been an MCDT client for four years. This will be her 8th loan. For all fout years, she has been working with the same three other women in her group.  \r\n<p>\r\nRobinah\u2019s monthly expenses include rent for both her home and business premises, school fees, and feeding her family. She wants to use this loan partly to pay school fees for her children and partly to buy more fish to sell.

Dalam pengerjaan sanggah ini memerlukan ketrampilan khusus dan harus dikerjakan oleh orang yang sudah terbiasa seperti halnya dengan I Nengah Dwikayama\nIstri dari I Komang Sulasmi ini dalam mengerjakan sebuah sanggah memerlukan waktu kurang lebih satu Minggu, dengan modal bahan (kayu dan alat2 lainya ) berkisar Rp 1.250.000-sd 1.500.000,- tergantung jenis kayu yang di minta oleh pemesan. Sedangkan harga sebuah sanggah saat ini Rp 2.000.000-  . Jadi dalam seminggu pendapatan yang di peroleh I Nengah Dwikayama sebesar Rp 500.000-750.000. Namun begitu I Nengah Dwikayama merasa sangat kawalahan dalam menerima order , hal ini disebabkan oleh karena tidak tersedianya  modal yang cukup untuk membeli bahan baku, khususnya Kayu yang kini semakin sulit di dapat dan harganyapun mahal.\nUntuk menunjang usahanya itu I Nengah Dwikayama ingin mendapat tambahan modal dari DINARI yang akan dipergunakan untuk membeli kayu untuk stok , sehingga pada saat ada order I Nengah Dwikayama bisa cepat mengerjakannya.\nDengan tambahan modal ini I Nengah Dwikayama optimis hasil yang di dapat akan lebih baik sehingga mampu menunjang biaya pendidikan kedua Orang anaknya Yang kini telah duduk di bangku SMA.          . \n","en":"I Nengah Dwikayama is coming from a family of carpenters.

He is now a master in making Sanggah, a wooden Pura (Pura is a temple in Hindu faith used to place the offerings). <p>\r\nI Nengah Dwikayama and his wife can build one Sanggah in a week time. They needs woods for the material that usually cost them around USD 130, depending on the type and the quality of the wood. They can sell one Sanggah for around USD 172. So they can earn a net profit of USD 40 per Sanggah sold. <p>\r\nAt the moment he is having difficulties in receiving orders from customers.

Therefore he applies for a loan from DINARI so he can get an additional working capital.<p>\r\nHe is hoping with more capital he can meet more orders from the customers.

Her \"Atiek\u00e9\" (granulated cassava) is carefully sieved before being filled into sacks or plastic wrappers. <P> \r\n\r\nSo as to satisfy her clientele and grow her business, she came to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She has been working with us for several years. After 5 group loans and 2 individual loans, all reimbursed without difficulty, she is on her third individual loan. <P>\r\n\r\nShe intends to use this loan to buy 3 tons of ati\u00e9k\u00e9 in the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Mrs. Aminata Doucour\u00e9  sells for cash and credit to a clientele composed of men and women. With this loan she expects to make a monthly profit of 150,000 F CFA which she will use to support herself and pay her children's school fees. Her ambition is to build a house. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":263999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"purchasing Ati\u00e9k\u00e9 (cassava granules) for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":46102.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135777,"comment":null},{"amount":90.9,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":46102.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033578,"comment":null},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":46102.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620946,"comment":null},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":46102.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019911,"comment":null},{"amount":90.92,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:25Z","rounded_local_amount":46102.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242656,"comment":null},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":46102.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678181,"comment":null},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":46102.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112419,"comment":null},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:53Z","rounded_local_amount":46102.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028076,"comment":null},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":46102.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873460,"comment":null},{"amount":90.91,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":46102.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763215,"comment":null},{"amount":90.9,"local_amount":45454.5,"processed_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":46102.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152034,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-02T04:50:40Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86735,"name":"Benkadi Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les femmes du groupe Benkadi ont en moyenne  37 ans et 4 enfants.

They know one another through community ties in the Rail Ko district of Diamarabougou.  They are all highly active in the traditional association and work essentially in buying and selling grain, fish, soap, and charcoal. \r\n<p>\r\nConcerned about satisfying their burgeoning customer base, they decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program, with which they are on their second loan, the first one being repaid.  The new loan will be use to buy:  405 kg of fresh fish (some of it sold fresh and half of it fried), sacks of onion, and charcoal.  Supplies of fish are gotten every day on the banks of the Niger River and at the Kirango marketplace.  While the charcoal is sold at home, the fish is sold fresh door-to-door in the Rail Ko district and is also sold fried across from the hospital.  Cash is accepted, and sometimes credit, from customers composed of women and men. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members intend to realize an average profit of 41,250 francs CFA per month that will be used generally for paying the loan interest, covering the school costs for the children, providing for family needs, and making payments to the tontine (community revolving credit system).  Their ambition is to have a house. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":264011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy fish and charcoal   ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanta              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kosso             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":375000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":126781.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135782,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":63390.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033583,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":63390.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620951,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":63390.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019916,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":63390.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242661,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-02T07:03:28Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86746,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Y.

Their ambition is to augment their working capital in order to diversify their commerce and to make a future for the children, little by little. \r\nNote:  Ami C. is absent from the photo because of the death of her child, who was murdered by thieves in Bamako (capital of Mali).   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":264041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy soap (in bars and powdered)  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Segou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djelika                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assetou                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nana                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":202850.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135784,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":101425.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033585,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":101425.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620953,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:21Z","rounded_local_amount":101425.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019918,"comment":null},{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:54Z","rounded_local_amount":101425.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242663,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-03-02T17:44:51Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86765,"name":"Hun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Hun N., 27, and her husband, Mr. Than Ros, 28, live in a small village across the Mekong River about 20 kilometers from Phnom Penh.

She is a divorced wife and mother of five children. Her children are now adults, working and have moved out of the family home. Esi now lives with her three year old grand daughter. She produces \u201cAlata soap\u201d which is a locally made soap; it is widely used by local people for washing and bathing. Alata soap is prepared from palm kernel oil, burnt cocoa pod, and soda. The name \u201cAlata\u201d stands for Nigeria. It is believed that the technology was learned from the Nigerians and by some Ghanaians who once lived in Nigeria. Due to the increase in the price of cocoa pods in the country, she is not able to buy more of the product, and is therefore requesting a loan to buy more raw materials.

She lives with her family in Bawjiase, a suburb of Accra, the capital city of Ghana, in a family house. Alberta loves commerce, the business through which she earns bread for her family. She buys and sells electrical appliances such as cables, wires, switches, screws, etc. Through her business, she has been very resourceful for her family.

Supplies are gotten from the different weekly fairs of the villages surrounding Koutiala.  She makes her sales, cash or credit accepted, at the grand marketplace of Koutiala, to customers composed of women and men. \r\n<p>\r\nShe intends to realize an average profit of 70,000 francs CFA per month that she envisions using to repay the loan interest, to help cover day-to-day family expenses, and to invest the rest in other income-generating work. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

To be able to provide for herself, she didn't take long to start money-making businesses, notably the sale of dried fish, that she learned from friends 25 years ago. Dried fish is the most sought-after in her community where most people are poor, since it's cheaper than meat or chicken.\r\nTo increase her revenues, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso four years ago. After six solidarity loans (group loan), all repaid without problems, she's now seeking her second individual loan. The first one was affected by her husband's death, but was fully repaid anyway.\r\nShe intends to buy 10 baskets of dried fish in Korientz\u00e9 (Mopti Region), from Bozo and Somon\u00f4 fishermen.

Aunque con el temor de haber invertido bastante capital en esta peque\u00f1a empresa, decidieron arriesgarse.\n\nEste impulso hoy deja ver los frutos, en solo cuatro a\u00f1os su peque\u00f1o negocio de la funeraria creci\u00f3 considerablemente.

At 54, she manages two businesses; clothing sales and a funeral home.\r\n\r\nApproximately 15 years ago, Francisca thought of selling clothes in houses.  In other words, she buys different clothing items and offers them from door to door.  Fortunately, today she doesn\u2019t need to look for clients because she has many, they make orders to her every month.\r\n\r\nShe wasn\u2019t doing bad with the business but she also didn\u2019t feel successful until her only son proposed her and his dad to start a business providing services in a funeral home.  In spite of the fear of having to invest a lot of capital in this small company, they decided to take the risk.\r\n\r\nThat risk is showing good results today, in only four years their small business at the funeral home has grown considerably.  In the last year, they have managed to purchase four automobiles for the funeral services and to implement whatever needed to expand the business.\r\n\r\nFrancisca and her family can\u2019t help to be proud of what they\u2019ve achieved. This motivates them to keep working even harder.

Gaitan sells bread and pastries in her house and also brings her items to the Roberto Huembes Market located in Managua. She sells her products every day and pays for her spot in the market. She buys the pastries from high quality bakeries in order to sell good products. With two years in this field of work, she has managed to accumulate some working capital, but not enough to buy all of the products she would like to offer her customers. For this reason, she would like a loan. She works with only the help of her teenage daughter because her sons are still very young. She is married and her husband helps her as well, but he does not help with the household bills which is why she started her business in the first place. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Brittany Thatcher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":264258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"Invest in the growth of the business in order to satisfy customer demands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T18:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

Guti\u00e9rrez is 34 years old and married. Mar\u00eda has 3 children of whom only one son is her care: he is aged 6 and in the third grade in primary school.  Her partner works as a security guard.  Their aim is to expand her business so that Maria's customers are satisfied and their dreams are to construct a house in order to leave a place to live to their children as it's very important to her husband that they all live together as a family.  Her husband has already taught the children many important lessons on how to be good men and women serving society.  Their wish is to improve their family's quality of life, as they have only managed so far with their business to secure stability through the payment of certain debts.  A further desire is to travel abroad as there she would be able to work and send back money to her sons to cover all the necessary expenses.  \r\n\r\nMaria's economic activity is to run a grocery store in which she offers good such as:  basic grains, sweets, natural juices and bread.  Her business is located in her home, and she has run her business for 6 years.  Mar\u00eda began her business because she possessed some of her own funds and saw the opportunity to start-up a business in her house. As the place where her house is located was a new delivery point, she decided to start with a few products such as soft drinks, sweets and fire wood.  As a result she had few customers as the area wasn't very populated but with the little she sold she was able to increase her stock which would serve right up to the present day when as a result of this source of income she has been able to obtain all that's necessary for the maintenance of her family.  The loan is for wok capital designated for the purchase of more products for her grocery in order that she can quickly satisfy customer demand.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":264302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Work Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T13:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6500,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":590.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":590.91,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":597.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400038,"comment":null},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":590.91,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":597.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092036,"comment":null},{"amount":29.54,"local_amount":590.91,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":597.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985419,"comment":null},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":590.91,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:57Z","rounded_local_amount":597.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446034,"comment":null},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":590.91,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":597.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956672,"comment":null},{"amount":177.26,"local_amount":3545.45,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3586.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174095,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

When she used to live with her sister, she worked at the local convenience store. After many years, she decided to become independent and buy her own home.  This meant that she had to quit her job at the store and start a new one.  About 20 years ago, she decided to sell bread in the mornings at a bus stop near her house. Unfortunately, she realized a few years ago that this job wasn't making her enough money as it did before.  This is why she began selling refreshments like soda and beer from her home.  She was also washing clothes but she broke her arm a few months ago and has yet to heal.  Thanks to her job, she has been able to educate and support her 2 children.

Silvia has one daughter aged 9 and studying in the fifth grade of primary school.  Her partner works outside the country.  Her aim is to establish an office-site so that from there she can take care of her home and be with her children so she will be able to care for them.  Her dream is to increase the number of products in order to offer the best so that her customers will turn to the quality that she offers as already the majority of her customers always order new fragrances from her, so she needs to look them out in order to satisfy her client\u00e8le.  Her hope is that her daughter will manage to enter into a professional career, following her studies intensely in order to obtain in the future a stable job.  \r\n\r\nSilvia's economic activity is the sale of general merchandise such as:  clothes, shoes, perfume and cosmetics.Her business is ambulatory as this is the most rapid and effective means of making sales.  Silvia began this business off her own back as from when she was small her family had taught her to work hard, as a result of which from the age of 20 she had to work helping within the household expenses, so started travelling alone to Managua searching for products even though she wasn't very expert which caused some problems as she wasn't able to make the different product purchases, but thanks to the sellers who took her under their wing she was able to find the places which offered the products in the most favourable forms.  Through the experiences she went, she had managed to acquire experience and thus began to improve her business, so she decided to continue with this activity.  Her motive for asking a loan is to increase her work capital so she is able to take advantage of the school-entry season for which she already has many orders: she also wants to purchase shoes. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":264306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Work capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T13:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":758.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400039,"comment":null},{"amount":44.88,"local_amount":897.65,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":908.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092037,"comment":null},{"amount":30.11,"local_amount":602.35,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":609.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985420,"comment":null},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":758.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446035,"comment":null},{"amount":61.48,"local_amount":1229.5,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1243.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956673,"comment":null},{"amount":538.53,"local_amount":10770.5,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10895.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174096,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Jos\u00e9 has 2 children: his elder daughter is 6 years old and is in the 1st grade of primary school, and his younger son is four years old and in the 3rd year of preschool.  His partner works as a waitress, and their aim is to continue maintaining this type of business even though in these days it is very difficult as the price of food is very high and the customers don't pay the difference in price.  Their dreams are to make improvements to their establishment, as it's in their interests that their business gains a reputation as a welcoming place so that their customers remain satisfied with the locale.  Their hope is to establish another type of business so that they will have two sources of income for the family.  The business they would like to establish is a distribution centre, as this will give them the profits to provide a better future for their children.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9's economic activity is running a bar and diner, located one block south from the San Felipe park.  He has owned this business for 5 years, Jos\u00e9 began this economic activity after his Mama asked her to administer the business thanks to her advanced age although in previous years she had given the rights to the business to a sister, but whose body was completely disfigured as a result of her arthritis which prevented her from undertaking any mobile activities.  As a result of this situation, it was Jos\u00e9 who assumed total control of the business, counting on the support of his wife and his mother, who despite being such an advanced age still felt committed to the family business.  Later he assumed the creditor's obligations that his sister had left with the Leon 2000 foundation, and in his turn had the opportunity to establish his own repayment record, and up until now he has been a good client despite his heavy work load (as he has an additional job which covers essential household expenses).

R. is 44 years old.  Don Juan has two children.  The oldest is 19 years old and is in his first year at college.  His daughter is 16 and is in her fifth year of high school.

He dreams of starting another branch of his business and having two stores that sell the same products.  He wants to increase his earnings to better support his family, because his salary and his wife's salary are not enough to cover the necessary household expenses.  He also wants to start purchasing his products wholesale because his is the only hardware store in town.  By purchasing wholesale, he can offer a wider variety of products and increase the size of his store.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Juan owns a hardware store in the town of Quezalguaque.  He has owned this business for 5 years.  Don Juan began his business when he was searching for a source of income more secure than agriculture.  Agriculture is seasonal and does not produce the daily income necessary to support his family.  For them, he decided to start a business that would be productive, such as a hardware store.  They started the business in their home and like all businesses, they began with only a few products, such as: nails, hammers, screws and other tools.  This made it difficult to attract clients, but with time, they expanded their inventory more to satisfy their clients.<p>\r\nThis loan is capital to purchase more tools, drills and other items, for

Esto no disminuyo sus fuerzas, por el contrario, la idea de terminar de  construir su casa y ambientar habitaciones para alquilarlas fue madurando.\n\nEsas ganas de progresar hicieron que junto con su esposo, construyera ocho habitaciones adicionales a las suyas para alquilarlas a diversas personas.

For the past few years, she has owned a mototaxi which she rents out to generate income.  She has two children aged five and three.  Since the birth of her first child she has been selling food in the mornings from the doorway of her home.\r\n\r\nThe fact that she was on a bus line ensured that her sales were good.  When the bus line changed routes, Nancy's sales suffered.  This did not diminish her efforts; on the contrary, she has formed a goal to finish building her home and decorate rooms to rent out.\r\n\r\nThis desire to better her situation means that together with her husband she has build eight additional rooms in order to let the rooms out.  She now needs to do the finishing work and the spaces will soon be habitable.

Thanks to a friend she was able to obtain the start-up capital to begin working, and she hasn't stopped since.\r\n\r\nShe used to work in people's houses, cleaning and doing laundry, but she left that work because she didn't have anyone to take care of her children, since she is a single mother.\r\n\r\nNow that she is 48 years old and her children are grown-up and independent, she not only sells fish but also prickly pears when they're in season. In the future she is thinking about selling food in her own home on the weekends, hoping to have work that is more stable and not as damaging to her physical health. She would also like to have a store, but that will require a larger investment and she must make sure the financial risk is worth it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":264394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","use":"Buy food to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-01-31T22:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bacilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":135,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.11,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":81.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393196,"comment":null},{"amount":18.89,"local_amount":17,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":18.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084886,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978350,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-01-31T22:04:57Z","paid_date":"2009-05-29T08:16:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":86906,"name":"Rafael Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nEl se\u00f1or Rafael L. se destacar por ser un trabajador que posee su propio negocio de ferreter\u00eda ofreciendo todo tipo de productos ferreteros los cuales son comercializados con mucho esfuerzo en su localidad y a pesar que se encuentra a la intemperie solo con una peque\u00f1a mesa de madera, ha logrado realizar ventas que le han permitido el sustento familiar.\n\nLa raz\u00f3n por la que el se\u00f1or A. ha buscado el apoyo en Ceprodel es para ser beneficiado con un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de los productos ferreteros y es por esto que muy confiadamente espera que su cr\u00e9dito sea otorgado para as\u00ed continuar con su negocio que tanto requiere de su apoyo y dedicaci\u00f3n.\n\n","en":"Rafael L. is well known for being a good worker.

She is babysitter. However, as the prices of basic food were higher and higher, this job was no longer enough for her to cover all her expenses. For that reason, five years ago, she decided to spend her free time (Sundays) making and selling chocolate, costume jewelry and yogurt.

His wife works in a hardware store. Their goals are to serve their customers since they provide the economic support through which they've survived with their family. Their desires are to establish a clothing store in which one will find a variety of merchandise such as clothing for women, men and children. Since, at this time, it is difficult to maintain such a business, he could manage it. Their dreams are to improve their living conditions. He would like to give his wife all the comforts she deserves, and his children so that they may have a fruitful future and not want for necessities.\r\n\r\nHis job is in general merchandise. His business is of the \"on foot\" nature. He's had this business for six years. Marcial began this business after he was laid off from his job at the Enel company, which at one time was part of the state and later was sold to a Spanish company that decided to cut personnel. He started with another business selling icy pops and ice cream. However, upon seeing the little earnings that it generated, he decided to incorporate sales of clothing on credit on foot.

Joan said that through the lenders who provide her with financial support and with her hard work and faith in God, nothing is impossible in achieving her dreams.

The family is living in the mountainous place of Hacienda San Antonio in Ilagan, Isabela with an average standard of living. <P>\r\n\r\nAt present, Marcela is asking for financial support that she can use in her farming and hog-raising business.  She is hoping that through the loan amount of PHP 5,000 their businesses will grow.  This will also encourage them to persevere for the improvement of their livelihood and to have a better life in the future. This financial assistance will also be helpful in sending their children to school.  She believes that \u201clife is like a wheel, sometimes you\u2019re on top and sometimes at the bottom\u201d.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Since his youth, he has raised livestock, specifically cows, on his farm. He is a family man who is very attentive to his children. Since he has been through difficult financial situations, he has fought to provide the education his three young children (one daughter and two sons) deserve. Currently, he lacks the resources to buy more cows. For this reason, he has sought the support of IMON International \u2013 to obtain a loan that would allow him to purchase two cows to raise and sell for meat in the region where he lives. With your support, Abdumutallim can achieve his goals.  <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Saidamir U. is 49 years old. He is married with 4 children. Four years ago, Saidamir decided to start his own business selling carpets. Saidamir began his business with his hard-earned savings as he had always wanted to be an entrepreneur. He is familiar with this business and provides good customer service. He has many customers, and his business keeps growing. In order to increase the range of carpets he has on offer, he now needs a loan in the amount of 2000 Somoni which he will use to purchase more inventory. He commits to repaying this amount within 11 months. Be a part of this business and of Saidamir's family by supporting his growing business. They greatly appreciate it! <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B. (the lady in white) is 31 years old and presently residing in Buenavista District, Pagadian City, Zamboanga Del Sur. She has 2 kids and her husband is a mechanic. Her eldest child is 11 years old, and her youngest is a 1-year-old girl. They've been married for 12 years, and through the years they've struggled and lived happily but full of dreams and hopes that someday they will own a restaurant with 12 employees so that they can help their neighbors who have no income or work.\r\n\r\nShe started a hanging rice business, through the encouragement of her sister-in-law, for income. She can make 100 and sell them to carenderias in the city. Hanging rice is composed of the leaves of the coconut tree and rice, and she supplies 2 carenderias daily with 300 pieces of cooked hanging rice, and also gets occasional orders, like for fiesta celebrations of the city, municipal activities, Christmas, Valentines Day and other celebrations.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan and skills assistance of Paglaum Cooperative, she applied for a loan worth Php 10,000.00, and expanded her hanging rice business. She started to look around for a potential area for display. She was inspired to start a carenderia for more income, as a stepping stone to achieve her dream, which included owning a restaurant. In this way she can give jobs to unemployed neighbors, and most of all, she provide for the needs of her 2 kids. Hopefully her husband can have a welding shop, too.  With her determination and guidance, nothing is impossible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":264252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They have been on this business for a year, and they decided to acquire additional fishing boats and fishing nets. They agreed to join Paglaum MPC last July 31, 2007, where they have used the financial services and other benefits such as insurance and savings deposit.  They request a loan for $325.
