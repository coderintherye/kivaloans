Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":31.25,"image":{"id":993526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy a young milk-giving cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2012-01-28T16:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-27T16:20:06Z","loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416571,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-28T18:17:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":376443,"name":"Carmen Victoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carmen de 52 a\u00f1os vive con su esposo y tiene dos hijos de 30 y 32 a\u00f1os.

It\u2019s a neighbourhood where formal businesses are mixed in with informal businesses, recreational areas, family homes, and apartments. Most importantly for Colombians, it contains the Metropolitan Stadium, one of the most important places for professional football in the country. It\u2019s the home of Junior, a much-loved team from the Caribbean coast.\r\n\r\nThis is where Carmen has her business. She sells medicines, stationery, and various other items as well as offering cellular phone service. She began this business in 2008 after selling clothes for over thirty years. The store is open seven days a week from 7am to 10pm. These long hours are very competitive and will result in many potential customers who recognize that Carmen offers very good prices and unequalled service. \r\n\r\nThe anticipated growth of the business has made Carmen think of the need for more working capital so she can buy in greater volume and get discounted prices. As a result she has approached the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation for her first loan. With the money she plans to buy underwear for which she has orders, school supplies, and a display case. This investment will bring success as it is backed by requests from her customers, she will buy at special seasonal prices, and because she will sell the items at the time when customers need them. It is easy to see that Carmen has lots of business experience."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":35.15,"image":{"id":966013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to buy underwear, school supplies, and a display case","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-29T16:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-27T16:20:10Z","loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66950},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":74735},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":76479},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":78263},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80089},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81958},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83870},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85827},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":87830},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":89879},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":91977},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":102143}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.08},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.15,"local_amount":66950,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":67468.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325077,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-29T20:01:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":385023,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia continua con su negocio de venta de muebles y colchones, la socia esta creciendo con su negocio y ahora requiere el prestamo para invertir en la compra de muebles y colchones al por mayor y comprara de la fabrica y lo repartira  a sus clientes y otra parte ella lo vendera de forma independiente.

Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping their inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase their profitability.

Working six days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 400,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nFatmata would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. She has already received and successfully repaid one loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy bottles, diapers, powder, and toy mobile phones. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 300,000 SLL. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Fatmata plans to transform her stall into an established shop, to assist her husband, and to educate her children. She thanks you for your support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":116.67,"image":{"id":991491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy baby items and clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kenema","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-01-28T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-27T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":511583.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505756,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-30T03:55:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":385966,"name":"Abbas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abbas is a 50-year-old Lebanese married man who lives with his wife and two school-aged children.

More than just a haircut, Jonnys offers his clients for 10 hours a day and sometimes more, self-improvement services that his friends, neighbors, and the general public take advantage of.\r\nEven though competition is high, he sustains by the quality he provides, his low prices, and complete customer satisfaction.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk and Marikina Shoe Exchange. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer on one-month-to-pay credit terms.

She earns a minimum of 2000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue business operations, she is requesting a Php29,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy merchandise and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands.  \r\n\r\nUrsula hopes to grow her business in the coming years.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAmia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 17,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAmia hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

She lives together with her son Maycol who she looks after in her own home, which is located in the town of Chilca.  Her courage is admirable as she brought up her three children on her own.  Two of her children are now living independently.  They have their own families and always look out for their mother.  Evarista continues caring for her remaining child who she loves very much.  For this reason, every day from Monday to Friday she works in a mine in the high area of the city.  There she mines gold, silver and copper, and earns a good wage for it.  This allows her to cover her expenses.  She tells us that she often pans the waste products which are thrown out of the mine and extracts small nuggets which she sells to jewelry stores in the city.  This makes her extra money.  However, as she doesn't always have this income, she started a small business buying sheep and grain which she sells in the country's capital city on the weekend when she has a break from her job.\r\n\r\nEvarista belongs to the \"Chilca' community bank and this is her fourth loan from MFP.

Therefore, she is requesting a loan of IDR 7,500,000 from TLM. This loan will be spent on more kiosk stock such as sugar, rice, biscuits, cigarettes and soft drinks.

He lives with his wife, Ani, and their daughter, Maricielo--who they dearly love--in a rented house in Chilca.  Carlos was born in the city of Huancayo, but his parents are from the country and he\u2019s proud of them for that.  Carlos has always worked hard.  His plan is to build a small house on a plot of land in the city, left to him by his mother.  He started his taxi business to raise the money he needs.  He drives the route between Huancayo and the city of Huancavelica, a trip that he makes once or twice [a day, a week?\u2014not clear] and he\u2019s happy with his earnings from the business.  His wife has a crafts business, turning wire and thread into human figures.  She makes around a thousand of the figures a day and is well paid for her work.  Carlos wants to drive larger buses, but he needs a new set of licensing and it\u2019s expensive to get.  He could earn a lot more with it, though, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s applying for this loan.   He belongs to the Chila community bank and this is his first MFP loan.

Tinguina is located in the Sechura Desert, about 4 hours south of Lima, the national capital. It is acclaimed by Peruvians as \u201cThe Land of the Sun.\u201d It's also known for its frequent earthquakes (a 8.0 in 2007 and 6.9 in 2011), its production of grapes, asparagus, and olives, and also, above all, as the source of Peru's national drink, the Pisco Sour. In this hot and arid climate we find the house and business of our client. In his free time, Santos enjoys playing football. As is well known, Peru has the world's most delicious dishes, and one such plate, which Santos likes very much, is \u201cRice with Chicken.\u201d Santos studied up to the 5th year of secondary school, but he would have liked to study automotive mechanics. Santos is living with his partner who is a worker in an agro-export enterprise. Together they have a 1-year-old baby who they love very much. And they struggle daily to get ahead.\r\n\r\nSantos not only has his business but, also, he is a seasonal laborer in a factory, which permits him to earn extra money. When he is not doing this, he focuses on his business, driving a moto-taxi. Santos does this 10 hours a day. His brothers motivate him and he is very determined and hard-working. In a day, Santos can attend to 40 customers, and this provides around 70 new sols per day. On a good day, he can earn up to 90 new sols, allowing him to cover additional household expenses. He thinks he is doing well and there is great demand for transportation. He treats his customers with respect and, above all, he believes in God and it is Him that guides his steps. Santos is infinitely grateful for the Kiva loaners who, thanks to their help, allow him to maintain his moto-taxi, which is his work tool.\r\n\r\nThis improvement loan will enable him to restore his vehicle to perfect condition and prevent having  problems that could cause an accident. And thus he will get more income and save in order to be able, in a few months, to buy another vehicle and continue his struggle to fulfill his grand dream: to have a transport enterprise.\t"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":46.57,"image":{"id":968755,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to maintain his moto-taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tingui\u00f1a","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-30T17:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-28T17:10:08Z","loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Moises","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.19},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.14},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.95},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.19},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.9},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.18},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.65},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.84},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.91},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":195.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.43},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.31},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.47},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.22},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.57,"local_amount":124.19,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":125.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271157,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-30T22:06:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":385580,"name":"Marleny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marleny, de 35 a\u00f1os es una joven responsable.

He has learned to manage any money that he has left to better provide for his children.  He lives too far out, he says, to receive basic services like electricity, but there are new programs in place that he hopes will deliver better services in the future.  Primitivo is a new borrower and this is his first MFP loan.  He is counting on your support to help him continue his business.  He likes his community bank because he knows most of the members and considers them to be good people.  \r\nHe will use this 800 new soles loan to buy organic manure to produce palm and to pay day laborers to help him harvest his crop.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":42.42,"image":{"id":993004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to pay for day laborers and buy supplies for his farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-29T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-28T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Primitivo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":113.13},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":129.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":128.56},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":138.65},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":146.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.39},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":42.42,"local_amount":113.13,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":114.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386382,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2012-01-30T21:34:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":386293,"name":"Gantulga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gantulga is 50 years old and lives with his wife, Otgon, and 2 sons in western Mongolia.

Sonia Margarita is 33 years old and lives in her own house with her husband and their three children aged 14, 9, and 5, two of whom attend school. For more than ten years Sonia has run a wholesale business selling a variety of seafood in the port near to her home. She sells shrimps, fish, conch etc. As she has had this business for several years, she has lots of experience. She has been able to earn the trust of her neighbours who now regularly buy from her.\r\n\r\nSonia is dedicated to her work and her goal is to provide the best service possible to her customers as the money she earns from it is her sole source of income. She expects it to remain so for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nThe needs of her family grow day by day, and often her income does not cover these costs. For this reason Sonia has decided to sell a greater variety of seafood.
