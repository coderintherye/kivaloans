M. is a borrower in the Semkini group at the Kihesa branch of BRAC in Iringa, Tanzania.

She works for twelve hours a day and usually makes about $92 a month in profit. She wants to invest more money into her business and increase those profits. \r\n\r\nTo reach this goal, she recently applied for and received her first loan from BRAC Tanzania. The loan is for 200,000 TZS, which is about $150. She will use this capital to improve her vending business. When Sara begins to gain extra profit due to the loan, she plans to invest it back into the business, so that it can continue to grow.

others can, why can\u2019t I?\u201d This is what Cristina A. voiced when she was asked about her principle in life. Cristina is now 46 years old and married to Zenon who is a foreman carpenter in Cabanatuan City. The couple and their children live in a place near the Cagayan River at Barangay Lullutan, Ilagan, Isabela. They are blessed with three children who are all studying. Crispin, their eldest, is now in college; the same with Melissa who was a college freshman; Angelo, their youngest, is studying in high school.\r\n\r\nCristina runs a variety store in front of their house. She sells various products to generate higher income for her family. She is thankful that, through the business, her family was able to survive the hardships of life. She is very proud that she is able to send her children to school through the business. She even goes to Pangasinan just to purchase fresh and dried fish to have sufficient source of income.\r\n\r\nCristina is hoping that, someday, their way of living will improve through her own sacrifices and patience. But for the meantime, her children\u2019s education is her priority.  She believes that she can also make her business progressive just like others who are striving to succeed. To further develop her business, Cristina is applying for a loan of PHP 8,000 as additional working capital.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":340379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To use

To making a living, M. owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector; specifically, she raises and sells livestock.  M. has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 2,500,000 VND per month from her work (primarily from raising cattle for sale).  <P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, M. joined TYM Fund in order to gain much-needed access to financial services and, in turn, to improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Notably, M. has successfully repaid a previous loan from TYM Fund.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.  M. is now requesting a new loan in the amount of 9,000,000 VND ($525), which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.  M. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business as a result of the loan to improve and expand her

is 57 years old and married to Julieta and they are happily residing in the simple village of Lullutan in Ilagan, Isabela. They are blessed with six children. All of them were not able to finish their studies due to financial difficulties. \r\n\r\nPedro maintains a ferryboat business in their village since their place is just along the Cagayan River. He transports passengers using his ferryboat by crossing the Cagayan River which is the biggest river in the Philippines. With his daily ferryboat routine, Pedro is able to earn income for his family.\r\n\r\nPedro wants to improve his ferryboat that he uses in transporting passengers to and from each side of the river to get to their different destinations. Since his well-used boat needs repair and improvement in every part of the boat, Pedro came to request a loan of PHP 4,000 as financial assistance for the maintenance of his daily income activity, especially since it is his only source of income to support his family with their important

Rosalinda and Alfredo reside in the village of Lullutan Ilagan, Isabela.  Their home is simple and is close to the market, but they need to cross the Cagayan River to get there. <p> \r\n\r\nRosalinda helps her husband with their ferry boat transport business.  Specifically, they transport passengers to and from their village to the town proper of Ilagan, Isabela.  The business has become the couple's sole source of income to pay for their daily living needs.  She is now seeking to borrow a loan in the amount of 8,000 PHP ($175) because their boat requires some maintenance work.  Rosalinda hopes to sustain their business operation so that they can continue to cover their daily expenses.  She explains that, even if they are a poor family, they can still live a normal life.

Rizalina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Rizalina from PMPC.

A. is from the village of Mantic, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental. She is 41 years old. Nancy is married and has nine school-aged children. To make a living, Nancy owns & operates a business making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Nancy has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nancy joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nancy is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Nancy from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is from the village of Anonang, Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur. He is 53 years old. Mario is widowed and has 11 school-aged children. To make a living, Mario owns & operates a food stall. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling crabs and other delicacies in the local community. Mario has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Mario joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mario has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Mario is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand his product offerings. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Mario from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay tuition fees for his children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

M. is from the town of Capatan, Tuguegarao City. She is 35 years old. Norma is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Norma owns and operates a business venture in the transportation services sector operating a cart pulled by a horse, which is called a \"kalesa\" business. \"Kalesa\" is one of the oldest forms of transportation in the Philippines. It helps in providing transportation services to local community members.  \n \nNorma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Norma is requesting a new loan of PHP 5000, which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This loan will be the  loan taken out by Norma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. The loan was also a big help in providing daily allowances for her children.\n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the pioneer microfinance institutions in the Philippines committed to serving the needy in Central and Northern Luzon through socio-economic development and holistic transformation.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our field partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She has always dreamed to see her children finish their schooling and acquire a degree. Thus, she strives hard to expand her business to realize this dream.\r\n\r\nMechie now thinks of acquiring a piece of land, probably less than a hectare (2.5 acres).

She resides and works in a semi-urban area, in the outskirts of Kampala. Margaret sells second hand clothes, door to door, in Kampala suburbs. She sells to an average of 10 people a day and sells to all categories of people.  She works six days a week. Margaret buys these clothes from Owino market, one of the busiest markets in Kampala, and incurs some transport costs. Her major monthly expenses include medication for the family, school fees and feeding the family. She has been in this business for the last ten years. Her main challenges include the rainy season, which stops her daily routine of selling door to door. Margaret has been with MCDT for over six years and requesting her twelfth loan, working all this long with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more clothes.

The main business challenge is the failure to access drugs for her animals. She is able to make 50,000 UGX as profits per week, hence being able to look after her children.

Ephrance buys the vegetables from Nakasero Market, one of the busiest markets in Kampala, and uses public transport to and from shopping. Her major monthly expenses include medication, school fees and feeding the family. She has been in this business for the last ten years. Her main challenge is the rainy season, which stops her daily routine of moving door to door. Margaret has been with MCDT for over ten years and requesting her twentieth loan, working all this long with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more fruit and vegetables.

belongs to a poor family in their village. She always aims to become successful in life in order to give her child and future children a better and comfortable living condition. In this regard, she encouraged her husband Domingo to earn and save for the future of their family through venturing into a direct-selling business. Therefore, she is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders of PHP 10,000 as additional working capital for the said business. Her husband also works as a welder in Subic\r\n\r\nThey both sacrifice for the future welfare of their children. According to her, she is able to gain a net income of PHP 2,500 monthly which she uses to support their daily needs and to pay some monthly bills and expenses. Through the loan, Melody is hoping that she will be able to help her husband to uplift their living condition into a progressive one

The family gets two meals a day.\r\n\r\nShe resides and works in a semi-urban area in the outskirts of Kampala. Margaret sells fried food in the Kasubi Market in one of Kampala's suburbs. She sells to an average of 50 people a day and sells to all categories of people. She works seven days a week. Margaret buys raw materials from Kikuubo, one of the busiest places in Kampala, and uses public transport to and from shopping. Her major monthly expenses include medication, school fees and feeding the family. She has been in this business for the last nine years.\r\n\r\nBesides frying eatables, she operates a ladies salon, also in Kasubi. Her main challenge is the rainy season, which disrupts her as she works from an open place. Margaret has been with MCDT for more than eight months and is servicing her second loan, working with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more cooking oil and wheat flour.

She is 56 years old and married with five children aged between 20 and 35. Two of her children go to school. She resides in and rents a two-roomed house where she is living with three people. She takes care of five additional family members. There is electricity but no piped water at her home. The family gets two meals a day.\r\n\r\nDaisy resides and works in a semi-urban area which is in the outskirts of Kampala. She operates a retail shop in Kanyanaya, one of Kampala\u2019s suburbs. She sells to an average of forty people a day and sells to all categories of people. She works seven days a week.\r\n\r\nDaisy buys home product items from Kikuubo, one of the busiest places in Kampala, and uses public transportation to and from shopping. Her major monthly expenses include medication, school fees and feeding the family. She has been in this business for the last nine years. Her main challenge is the ever-rising price of commodities which affects her customers because she can\u2019t easily increase the prices at which she sells her commodities.\r\n\r\nDaisy has been with MCDT for over six years and is servicing her eighth loan, working with the same group members. She wants to use this loan to buy more commodities like sugar, soap, cooking oil, salt and wheat flour. Daisy hopes to see her business grow bigger and to own a permanent business

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To be able to feed her family she together with her husband are feeding and selling cattle. They live in the village where there's no work. Their main source of income is raising of cattle and growing of agricultural produce. Her oldest son sends her some money, but now because of the financial crisis he has not sent money for the last two months. She sold a bull and planned to buy a milk cow. But the cow costs more and for this she has come to MicroInvest for a loan. She learned about the loan terms. After receiving the loan she has bought a cow. Right now she has several milk cows. Mahsuda and her husband Abdumajit Domulloev are thankful to Kiva for supporting their business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":341507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.Rasulov","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahsuda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":117501,"name":"Clementine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clementine N. lives in Kigali, Rwanda and has an egg business, raising chickens and selling the eggs.

She is a widow and the mother of three children who are all now adults and have moved away from Boane. She supports three grandchildren between the ages of 8 and 12, who live with her in her house. She didn't finish first grade because she had problems with her vision from a young age. It was said to be a spiritual malady. As a young girl she trained for five years as a traditional healer.\r\n\r\nShe left Gaza during the civil war all by herself because her children were already living in Maputo. She lived in their house with them, and later acquired some land and built her own house in Boane.\r\n\r\nLeonor has been a businesswoman for three years and owns a business where she works 7 to 12 hours a day. She doesn't have any employees, and works on her own to sell staple goods, mainly peanuts, which she buys in 50-kg bags for 1750 meticals and sells for 50 meticals a kilo. She earns about 700 meticals a day, which she uses to cover living expenses, and then saves some money in a commercial bank, where she has an account.\r\n\r\nLeonor has already received five loans from Hluvuku-Adsema, all for her business. She will use this sixth loan of 15,000 meticals to increase her stock so she can respond to demand for goods.\r\n\r\nShe heard about Hluvuku through friends. Her previous loans were in the amounts of 2500, 5000, 8000, 15,000, and 10,000 meticals.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Leonor wants to furnish her house, and will request additional loans for that purpose once this one has been paid off.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":341542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"To increase stock in her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonor Elija ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":659.14},{"due_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":688.93},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":720.08},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":752.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":786.65},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":822.21},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":859.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":898.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":938.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":981.28},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1025.64},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1072},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1120.46},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1171.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1224.05},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1279.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.41},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.6},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.85},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.52},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.94},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.99},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.32},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.09},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.95},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.89},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.92},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.27,"local_amount":659.14,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":670.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63191030,"comment":null},{"amount":26.41,"local_amount":688.93,"processed_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:48:28Z","rounded_local_amount":701.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73618896,"comment":null},{"amount":275.68,"local_amount":7191.6,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:52:01Z","rounded_local_amount":7319.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056736,"comment":null},{"amount":247.64,"local_amount":6460.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":6575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971686,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-07-06T13:17:22Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T23:27:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":117517,"name":"Wilson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. T.

He earns a monthly salary of 3000 meticals.\r\n\r\nHe heard about Hluvuku through friends and has never obtained loans from other banks. This is his second loan, in the amount of 10,000 meticals, which he plans to use to purchase construction materials. His first loan was for 8000 meticals, which he used to buy consumer goods.\r\n\r\nHe intends to pay off this loan in accordance with the loan schedule so he can finish the house he's building soon and be able to furnish it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva
