She is a resident of Caloocan City just north of Manila on the island of Luzon. Melita maintains a direct sales business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct sales brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct sales brands. She also sells beauty products to salon, beauty shops and barber shops. \r\n<p>\r\nThe way in which a direct sales business works is that a customer\u2019s order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, so these are the profits that dealers count on as their income. \r\n<p>\r\nMelita\u2019s regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every week. To help her continue operations, she is requesting a 34,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy orders for her customers.

At this time, she is working hard to be able to support both of her children and continue sending them all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Ursula, as she herself is a college graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave their children.\r\n<p>\r\nUrsula operates a buy-and-sell business. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers, then sell items piecemeal, thus resulting in a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing and other such products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low prices and the many options they are offered. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her continue operations, she is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n<p>\r\nUrsula dreams of giving her all of her children a good and high quality education through all of her hard work. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her husband is a driver and they have three children aged eight years, five years and three years old whom they hope to give a good education to the university level. \r\n\r\nHer business is located at a busy market in a residential area called Mukuru Kwa Njenga. Irene is served by the Kitengela Branch. She provides milling services to the local people. She also mills her own maize and other cereals into flour which she sells to the local people. She has been in doing this business for the last two years now. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is travelling long distances in search of cereals. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. \r\n\r\nShe is using her loan of Kes 20,000 to buy more cereals to grow her business and meet the demand of her customers. She has a dream of acquiring a bigger 'posho' (cornmeal) milling machine which can make a whole sack of flour in a short period of time. She describes herself as hardworking, independent, reliable and focused. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":608832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"buying beans, maize to grind and sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitengela","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":138,"posted_date":"2010-09-28T21:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.67,"local_amount":4533.34,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4578.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177475734,"comment":null},{"amount":26.66,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2154.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751047,"comment":null},{"amount":51.29,"local_amount":4103.34,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4144.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191488667,"comment":null},{"amount":9.62,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:04:25Z","rounded_local_amount":777.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195916815,"comment":null},{"amount":9.62,"local_amount":770,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:27:28Z","rounded_local_amount":777.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201488731,"comment":null},{"amount":40.58,"local_amount":3245.54,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:47:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3278,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206225234,"comment":null},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":2444.46,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-24T07:59:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2468.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212415412,"comment":null},{"amount":25,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2020,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221894118,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-29T01:27:50Z","paid_date":"2011-08-16T08:18:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":235113,"name":"Saima's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saima comes fron a small city in Pakistan called Kasur, famous in Pakistan for its leather industry. She is a resident of Basti Laal Shah which is a small housing colony in Kasur. She moved here with her husband and children 5 years ago. She is married to M. J. and has given birth to 5 children, 2 sons and 3 daughters. None of them has been able to get an education due to poor financial conditions. \r\n\r\nSaima herself is supporting her family financially from her embroidery business. She makes embroidered dresses for orders which she receives from different boutiques and cloth shops.  She receives good earning after completing the orders on time. Her earning allows her to pay the utilities expenses of her family. \r\n\r\nHer husband is a painter by trade and paints walls, windows and doors to order. People hire him for painting their houses. He gets work on a contract basis. Most of the time, he is hired by construction companies. He also runs a dairy business from his home. He has some buffaloes at his home from which he gets milk to sell for extra income. His dairy business helps him when he doesn\u2019t get any orders from the other clients.\r\n  \r\nSaima has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for her embroidery business. With the loan amount she will buy embroidery materials such as beads, colored thread, sketches and cloth in bulk quantity for her embroidery business. With the bulk items she can offer more quality of work to her customers and make good profit. She is a new loan user of Asasah and is hopeful that this loan will earn her good profits. \r\n\r\nNote: In the picture, the lady who is raising her hand is

He is 33 years old, married, and has two children. He has been working in the business of stone cutting for the past 14 years, but only started own business in 2008. At first Nidal encountered difficulties such as not being known by customers and his limited experience. Things have, however, started to change and he is gaining customers\u2019 trust. His passion for the stone craft and his good experience are what have made it possible for him to have his own business. Nidal submitted a request for a loan from the Lebanese Association for Development, Al-Majmoua, in order to purchase new casts for industrial stone molding, as well as to complete the construction of his workshop.

Four of them are currently attending school. \r\n\r\nShe recently repaid her fourth loan from Juhudi Kilimo and has requested this loan of 41,600KES to purchase and insure a dairy cow. She says that the income from this loan will improve her family's livelihood. In future, she would like to purchase a quality dairy cow that will increase her milk production. She faces the challenge of fluctuation in market prices and changes in climatic conditions. She is happy that Juhudi has empowered her economically."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":608865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase and insure a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-09-28T22:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":41600,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3466.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3466.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3466.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3466.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3466.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3466.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3466.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3466.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3466.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3466.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3466.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3466.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.87,"local_amount":3476,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3544.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177437374,"comment":null},{"amount":43.87,"local_amount":3476,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:34:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3544.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182576757,"comment":null},{"amount":43.87,"local_amount":3476,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3544.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188712516,"comment":null},{"amount":51.74,"local_amount":4100,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:58:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4180.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195872416,"comment":null},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":6272.02,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-21T08:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6395.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202030312,"comment":null},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":3466.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3535,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206668380,"comment":null},{"amount":150.42,"local_amount":11919.31,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":12154.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211446904,"comment":null},{"amount":64.36,"local_amount":5100,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5200.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227073841,"comment":null},{"amount":3.97,"local_amount":314,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:34:01Z","rounded_local_amount":320.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250816960,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-29T01:00:12Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:34:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":235126,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose has been practicing mixed farming for the last ten years in Kitale town, western Kenya.

Her mixed farm produces maize, vegetables and potatoes which she sells locally. She also depends on the salary of her husband who is employed as a teacher to cater for the needs of her family. She is 46 years old and married with 7 children who are between the ages of 5 and 27. Six of the children are currently attending school.\r\n\r\nAgnes has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo of 57,200KES to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

The applicant\u2019s shop is distinguished by its owner\u2019s exquisite taste as well as its 24-hour services ready to meet anyone\u2019s needs. Among the larger orders the applicant fills are those for wedding flowers and decorating wedding caravans with flowers. The applicant\u2019s patrons come from the general area and include hotel and restaurant owners, wedding providers, and tourists.

The applicant is now asking for a loan of $1500 to purchase seasonal flowers as well as stands and shelves to more aesthetically showcase her products.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  rice retailing and a scrap recycling businesses. Her husband, Bonifacio M., who is 48 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living. They have 14 children who are 5 to 24 years old. Nenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nenita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10000. She intends to purchase unmilled rice grains to dry, process and resell so that she can continue to save up to send their children into school to finish their studies. Nenita M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nNenita is shown in the accompanying picture with the rice grains she is sun-drying before she sends it to the rice mill for processing.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She makes all kinds of clothes.  She learned these skills from her aunt with whom she lives and works.  Her experience dates back to 2002 when she became interested in this kind of work watching her aunt but only since 2004 that she actually went into it.  Her specialty is athletic wear and recently she acquired as customers local schools that placed an order.  She, therefore, needs to buy fabric to manufacture this line of student athletic clothes.  \r\n\r\nShe also needs to buy a finishing sewing machine that will allow her to improve the quality of her products and surely gain new customers.  This is precisely why she is asking for her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization she was referred to by a good client of the Fundaci\u00f3n.  Vivian plans to grow hand in hand with it because her goal is to enlarge her workshop to continue improving her quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe currently lacks additional working capital that would help her deepen her involvement with educational institutions and the little capital she works with does not allow her to respond effectively to the real customers she has which are the schools for which she makes sportswear so that the students can participate in athletic activities that are part of the curriculum.\r\n\r\nAnother one of her markets is neighbors for whom she makes dresses because they know her and like the way Vivian makes clothes.  She hopes to make their clothes for the end of year festivities so that they will look elegant and continue to be profit generating customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael

This experience was significant in his life in that it made him determined to start his own business which today is called \u201cTienda MAFE\u201d with which he became independent at the age of 20 and which he has managed to stabilize before his present age of 27.\r\n\r\nHe has faced several challenges in his store like when many customers who had taken items on credit didn\u2019t pay him.  However, this did not discourage him and he continued forward just being more careful about choosing customers when credit was the issue.  Now his sales on credit are very few; he sells almost his entire stock of merchandise for cash.\r\n\r\nAt one time or another he was also a victim of holdups but with help from his parents he continued toward his goal of stabilizing the business always counting on help from his sister who is his right hand.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use it to buy merchandise like: foodstuffs, snacks, beverages and the usual items that go into a family\u2019s daily needs.  He will also use it to pay debts he has with his suppliers and gain the discounts offered for cash purchases.\r\n\r\nHis ideal is to own his house because he currently rents.  His greatest challenge is a lack of credit history that makes him ineligible for loans from financial institutions.  This is why he\u2019s called upon the Fundaci\u00f3n to undergo his first experience with financing;  he hopes to grow alongside it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael

She lives in the Bella Vista neighborhood of the city of Catacamos, Olancho.  Andrea has been making food such as corn tortillas, nacatamales (a type of large tamale typical of Central America), sweets, and other dishes for 15 years.  She started out selling corn tortillas to support her 4 children.  Now, Andrea and 2 of her children and a daughter-in-law get up early every day at 3am, since they have a deal where they must deliver tortillas at 8am.  In addition, she sells nacatamales made of chicken and meat, small bean tamales, and on Sundays she makes beef tacos.  Her advantage is that she can work out of her own house.  One difficulty she faces is that she doesn't have enough money to make a greater quantity of products.  Andrea requests a loan so that she can buy supplies such as corn, beans, firewood, green plantain leaves (to wrap the nacatamales in), meat, cooking oil and condiments.  With the support of this loan, she will be able to make her products and have better earnings so that she can improve the living conditions of herself and her family.  This is her 3rd loan cycle with FAMA, and with the support of these loans she has been able to grow her business and diversify the products that she makes.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":608573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy beans, corn, firewood, meat, cooking oil, condiments, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Catacamas","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2010-09-28T20:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea Adelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396163,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-08T10:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534720,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189137393,"comment":null},{"amount":38.36,"local_amount":697.47,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-21T08:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":724.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195833426,"comment":null},{"amount":71.98,"local_amount":1308.72,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-05T08:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275971,"comment":null},{"amount":54.66,"local_amount":993.81,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-02T08:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206143289,"comment":null},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-29T07:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211216233,"comment":null},{"amount":165,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3117.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216494614,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-28T23:43:00Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":235180,"name":"Esmeralda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Esmeralda quedo viuda muy joven, despu\u00e9s de eso inicio un peque\u00f1o negocio en su casa y con los ingresos de ese negocio saco a sus hijos adelante, es por eso que ella requiere de este cr\u00e9dito, para comprar mas mercanc\u00eda para la tienda de abarrotes, para elevar sus ingresos y si seguir apoyando a sus hijos en los estudios.

Amongst the animals that she raises, you can find chickens, ducks, pigs, and cows.\r\n<p>\r\nShe sells the animals on various occasions during the month, when she needs money for her family, since her husband is a farmer, and neither one counts on fixed periodical income.  She says that this activity on many occasions was able to save the family and for that reason, it is very importan to maintain the activity.  She is requesting the loan for the purchase of wire fencing in order to build a corral for her animals, since it will make it easier to handle them.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":608983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy wire fencing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Santan\u00ed","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-09-28T22:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Griselda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arminda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Floriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fidelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Delfiria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5141802,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":856967},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":856967},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":856967},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":856967},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":856967},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":856967}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":856967,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":875416.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177413796,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":856967,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":875416.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182553432,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":856967,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":875416.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188689802,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":856967,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":875416.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191429029,"comment":null},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":856967,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":875416.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195848158,"comment":null},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":856967,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-22T08:06:37Z","rounded_local_amount":875416.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202121901,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-29T06:03:45Z","paid_date":"2011-04-22T08:06:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":235191,"name":"Aminata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 35-year-old Aminata K..

She makes adult sports clothes, which she hopes to watch grow into a large company.  Since 2006, she studied design, cut, and tailoring at a technical college.  In 2008, after investigating her idea, she started her own business, purchasing a domestic sewing machine and beginning her work in her tiny apartment.  With discipline and responsibility, her capital began increasing little by little until she owned 5 semi-industrial sewing machines and dominated her neighborhood's market, keeping in mind that there is a lot of competition from other nearby workshops.  Currently, she is seeking her first financial loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization that she felt encouraged to join for their available services.  She wants to add an industrial sewing machine in order to improve the finishing on her pieces and their production time.  Her dream is to expand her workshop and to offer a selection of products that capture the attention of potential clients located in other areas of her locality that have yet to know about her business.  Her main challenge has been winning her sector's market since she is surrounded by three other workshops.  Nonetheless, she is situated in front of an important shopping center, where there are accessible means of reaching her business and serve as a strategic point for its growth.

She lives in her own home with her husband and her 3 children. Alioza's daily activity is embroidering cotton polo shirts. She dedicates all of her attention to this activity because it requires a lot of care and precision. She completes 20 to 30 polo shirts a week, depending on the size and design. Once the work is finished the shirts are sold but first they go through a comprehensive purchase review that determines the amount she will receive since these shirts are exported. What she enjoys most about this work is that she can do it at home which allows her to stay with her daughter. She has been doing this work for 2 years and hopes to become a great distributor so that she can increase her income and provide her children a good education.

He has a home that is modest, but very cozy, that he built himself out of wood.  Roberto cultivates cocoa and bananas in the village of Triboline, located in the Huanta district.

Cocoa is marketed in the collection centers in his town, while he sends his bananas to the city of Ayacucho, where he has customers that wait for the arrival of his quality fruit.

This is his first loan with MFP, and he assures us that he will not fall behind on his payments because he does not want to let down his communal bank, since they gave him the confidence to work together.

Guti\u00e9rrez is 58 years old and lives in Cartagena with her husband and two children.  For several years she has worked as a pastry chef and caterer for parties, especially banquets.  Minerva has always enjoyed taking courses, so she learned the art of baking and preparing specialty dishes such as comfort food.  Her career started when she first thought of the idea for a business in the neighborhood of Las Palmeras where she previously lived.  After completing her cooking and baking courses, Minerva began preparing the recipes she learned and found out she enjoyed cooking for the public.  At that point, she moved to the neighborhood of Socorro where she started her food business.  She has the support of her family who provide a great deal of assistance.  Since she engages in two activities that make her happy, Minerva has been able to generate income which she can use to gradually continue her studies.

With this loan, she will buy ingredients and supplies for preparing desserts.  She also plans to start a new business selling different merchandise, such as dresses and cosmetics, so that she can take advantage of the year-end holidays and earn some extra money.  The loans she has received have transformed her business for the better.  It should be noted that she was able to increase her infrastructure by acquiring tools and equipment.  Managing her own business has helped Minerva to become stronger and more independent.  Her dreams are to establish a niche market, expand her network of customers, and set up a banquet hall where she can be in charge of all the details including the curtains, tablecloths, desserts, cakes, and specialty dishes.

Before her marriage she used to work as a hairdresser. After her marriage she stopped working in that field in order to dedicate herself to taking care of her husband. However, with her husband\u2019s encouragement, she developed an interest in commerce so as not to remain inactive. She purchases thioubs (traditional damask-type cloth) which she sells on credit, collecting payment from customers at the end of the month.

She lives in Purok Mahigugma-on, Barangay Maricalum, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store, food vending and motorcycle businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $117. \r\n\r\nAdela is now borrowing 16,000 PHP so that she can purchase more items to sell and for motorcycle maintenance. This will be her 7th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 13,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Adela aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: she runs a general store; she also buys un-milled rice from farmers and after drying the grains, sends it to the rice mill for processing and sells the polished rice; and she raises and fattens pigs in her backyard. \r\n\r\nHer husband Ignacio S., who is 36 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between the ages of 2 and 11 years old. One of the children has work, three are in school and the youngest is still at home.\r\n\r\nMercy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 17,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $140, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 19th cycle loan, she is borrowing 17,000 PHP, which she intends to add to her own working capital to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and for business expansion. Mercy S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

They have 3 young children, who they love and care for with great affection. They live in a rented house in the town of Patay.  \r\n\r\nEvery morning, Ovi wakes up early to fix breakfast for her children, who are in school. She spends the rest of the day caring for the fields where she grows food. Ever since she was a little girl she has learned to work the land - \"agriculture is part of who I am\", she says. She got her own land to cultivate some six years ago and now she has enough money to invest in the purchase of more seeds, in order to increase its profitability. \r\n\r\nOvi grows peas, potatoes and gladiolus. In two months she will harvest two hectares [almost 5 acres] of peas, and she already has buyers in the town's central market. The high quality of her vegetables has meant high demand and more profits. In a few years she will be able to acquire more land and build her own house. \r\n\r\nThis is Ovi's fourth loan with MFP [the Kiva field partner], and the communal bank that she belongs to has a very high level of savings. She feels both happy and accomplished as a part of this communal bank.

His greatest desire is to see his family enjoy a better quality of life.  Area residents consider him a trustworthy person.

En su pueblo natal Idalia  tenia un negocio de vender prendas de oro, y al partir de all\u00ed, porque se volvi\u00f3   dif\u00edcil la convivencia pac\u00edfica, abandon\u00f3 su negocio y trajo solo $100.000 COP, pero como ya ten\u00eda  la experiencia de negocios, no abandon\u00f3 la convicci\u00f3n de iniciarlo en la nueva poblaci\u00f3n; as\u00ed fue que invirti\u00f3 en mercanc\u00eda y reparti\u00f3 entre varios clientes que le recomendaron  a los que semanalmente visitaba para recoger el dinero producto de sus ventas, que volv\u00eda a invertir  y con este trabajo lograba generar  utilidades para ayudar a sostener su hogar. \n\nComo esto no le alcanzaba para responder a su clientela, se emple\u00f3 de dom\u00e9stica es una casa por d\u00edas   y fue as\u00ed como reuni\u00f3 dinero para comprar constantemente; cuando obtuvo su capital , a\u00fan quedaba mal en responder a los pedidos,  por eso una amiga le recomend\u00f3 buscar un cr\u00e9dito con la  Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y ella accedi\u00f3,  hizo algunos cursos administrativos, pero a pesar de que le aprobaron su cr\u00e9dito, su esposo como no ten\u00eda experiencia en este tipo de financiamiento, le recomend\u00f3 no retirar el dinero de su cuenta y devolverlo, ella as\u00ed lo hizo mientras continuaba trabajando con mucha dificultad lo que la oblig\u00f3 a regresar a esta organizaci\u00f3n,  sin decirle a su c\u00f3nyuge  y ahora se siente muy contenta porque su negocio ha logrado crecer; antes ten\u00eda su mercanc\u00eda metida en un tanque,  hoy tiene cuatro vitrinas muy bien surtidas en un sector comercial y donde todo el que pasa le compra porque es muy concurrido. Ahora su esposo quien aparece con ella en la fotograf\u00eda se siente orgulloso de ella y la acompa\u00f1a en todas las decisiones emprendedoras de Idalia, pues ha logrado demostrar su potencial de crecimiento y gran capacidad de multiplicar su dinero. \n\nEn la actualidad solicita su credikiva para ponerle cielo raso a su negocio que con el apoyo de la fundaci\u00f3n,  logr\u00f3 adecuar un local y separar la zona familiar de la productiva y ahora necesita enchaparla para que se vea m\u00e1s vistoso y todos sus clientes no quieran Salir de \u00e9l de lo c\u00f3modo que se encuentran. Idalia dice que nada hubiera sido posible sin la ayuda de Dios, y que a \u00e9l le pide cumplir su sue\u00f1o de tener un almac\u00e9n. Su m\u00e1s grande desaf\u00edo fue cuando su hija sufri\u00f3 un accidente y ella la ayud\u00f3 a salir adelante descapitaliz\u00e1ndose un poco, aqu\u00ed recuerda como la Fundaci\u00f3n siempre en estos casos le ha tendido la mano, por eso no se cambia a ninguna instituci\u00f3n.\n \n   \n","en":"Idalia G. and Eduardo Tapias, her husband (who appears in the photo and works in another business in Barranquilla) are a couple who, between the ages of 24 and 34 years old, came with their four children from San Juan Nepomuceno to a place very near Barranquilla. In their hometown of Idalia, they were selling items made of gold; because it became difficult to live together peacefully, they abandoned their business and brought only $100,000 COP, but since they already had business experience, they did not abandon the will to begin it again in a new place; therefore, they invested in merchandise and distributed it among various customers who recommended them, and they visited them weekly to collect the money from sales, which they again invested, and in this way generated profits to help them afford their home. \n\nAs this was not enough for serving their customers, they began working out of their home by day, and this was how they earned money for constant purchases, when they had the capital, although it was still not enough to fill all the orders. Because of this a friend recommended they seek a loan with Kiva partner Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, and Idalia agreed. She took some management classes, but when the Fundacion approved her loan, her husband, who did not have experience with this kind of financing, suggested that she not take the money out of her account and that she return it. Idalia did so, while continuing to work with great difficulty, which drove her to return to this organization without telling her husband, and now she is very pleased because her business has grown. Before, she had her merchandise displayed in a tank; now she has four well stocked display cases in a commercial area where everyone who passes buys because its very popular. Now, her husband, who is in the picture with her, is proud of her and assists her in all the business decisions. She has demonstrated her ability to grow and multiply her money. \n\nNow she is requesting her loan to put in a ceiling, and, with the help of the Fundacion, adapt the place to separate the family area from the business area. She needs to cover it so it will look nice and so her customers will never want to leave the comfort they find themselves in.  Idalia says that none of this would have been possible without God's help, and she asks Him to help her realize her dream and have a warehouse.  Her biggest challenge was when her daughter had an accident, and she helped her be more successful by selling off a bit, and she remembers how in these sorts of cases the Fundacion always lent her a hand, and because of this she will never go to any other organization.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":609336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Remodel

V. and her husband dreamed of having their own house in the future and to live a simple but comfortable life. However, her husband passed away and that dream was left to Evaluz to accomplish. At age 56 and a widow, she did not lose hope that she could still fulfill the dream of having their own house. Though life became tough for her, she never gave up. Instead she worked hard in order to perform her responsibilities as both father and mother of their three children. \r\n\r\nTo have access to capital to start a small business, she joined Ahon sa HIrap, Inc.- a partner micro-finance institution of KIVA in the Philippines - in the year 2006. During those years she experienced hardship but she was so determined that she stayed active in her membership. She is one of the very good members of ASHI and serves as a model to her group and to the center. Her business is doing well and her profit helps in providing the daily needs of her family. \r\n\r\nNow she is applying for another loan of 14,000 PHP to use as additional capital for her store. She will buy more grocery products, canned goods, bath and detergent soaps, liquors, cigarettes, rice, sugar, cooking ingredients, shampoos, assorted candies and snack foods. She will also buy assorted toys in preparation for the Christmas season. \r\n\r\nShe was able to send her children up to high school and is still dreaming of sending them to college someday. She hopes that with this additional capital she can earn more and save for the schooling of her children and hopefully start building their own house. She is optimistic that she will reach all her dreams with the help and support of ASHI and KIVA, and of course with the blessing from our Creator.

Maricel has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maricel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maricel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital.

She is 35 years old, married to a fisherman and blessed with 4 children. The family depends only on fishing as their source of income. Her husband does the fishing but he has to borrow fishing gear from their relatives or neighbors for a certain percentage of the catch. For this reason the income is not sufficient for the family. \r\n\r\nIt was in 2009 that Ahon sa HIrap, Inc. (ASHI) a microfinance institution and partner of KIVA in the Philippines, opened its program in their community.  Marita immediately grabbed the opportunity to join the program. Full of hopes and motivation that she could buy fishing gear for her husband, she looked for 4 interested friends to form a loan group. Her first and second loan were utilized in buying fishing nets and the loan she is applying today, worth Php 15,000.00 pesos, will be used to purchase a \u201cBanca\u201d (a canoe made of fiver glass) so that her husband will no longer borrow from others. He will be glad to have his own banca because it does not only increase their income but it allows him to go fishing anytime at his convenience. She is so excited because since she joined ASHI their life became much easier than before. The couple can now meet the needs of the family and send their children to school. The couples are glad there are institution like ASHI and KIVA that provides financial assistance with social response to poor but deserving families like theirs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":609453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","use":"to buy a

She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

With the loan amount, her husband will buy seasonal fruit in bulk quantity and improve his sales. He has a plan to start a fruit shop in the market where he can display a variety of fruits to people and improve his client base. He is hopeful that he will be able to do so with the loan profit.  \r\n\r\nNazia is also hopeful that her husband will make good use of this money and successfully achieve his plan for the future. She is a new loan user of Asasah and this is her 1st loan application. She hopes it will be a profitable experience for her. \r\n\r\nNote: In the picture, the lady who is raising her hand is Nazia.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":609565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To

ends meet. Out of curiosity, I took it upon myself to visit this riveting place. There is a semblance of beehive activity as young people go about their work. \r\n\r\nM. Muhammed, who started the quarry three years ago, is a good humored and easily approachable lad who has one child. He belongs to the Namataba Development  group.

Twenty years ago B. Jane, age 48, of the Rwensinga Twimukye group, changed her business into a food selling enterprise.

She earns approximately $89 a month.\r\n \r\nA married mother of two adopted children, Jane has worked hard, knowing that her responsibilities are cut out for her.
