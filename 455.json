Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nThese loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans and giving Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

N. is 17 years old and lives in the town of Zana in the Kampala West region of Uganda.  Single with no children, she has had a business rearing poultry for two years.  Shakirah also sells vegetables  <p>\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Shakirah has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda to purchase more feed for the chickens (maize brand) to generate greater profits and pay school fees.  In the future, she hopes to become a lawyer. Shakirah is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by creating a job for her that has helped the family in paying school fees.<p>\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans and giving Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n

She sells her traditional D\u00e8gu\u00e8 cream at the big market of Sikasso to a clientele composed of women, mostly fair-goers.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she hopes to earn a monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA, which will be used to cover the bulk of the family expenses and to pay the interest on the loan, any remainder to be invested in her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":593742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase ingredients for the preparation of D\u00e8gu\u00e8 (cream of cereal)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-29T07:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":31021.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180848,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":31021.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476817,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31021.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613529,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":31021.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751958,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":31021.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606213,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":31021.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917887,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":31021.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360837,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":31021.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226154,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:59:38Z","rounded_local_amount":31021.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301075,"comment":null},{"amount":60,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":31021.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580705,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-29T21:07:09Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:51:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228053,"name":"Nahashon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nahashon, a 35-year-old father of one, sells cereals such as rice and beans to earn a living.

She lives with her husband and children in Hamdallaye, one of the working-class districts of the town of Sikasso (the third administrative region of Mali).\r\n\r\nAfter trying various business activities without success, about three years ago Mrs. Elizabeth C. started selling clothing (traditional  fabrics such as dyed damask-type \u201cbazins\u201d  and colorful \u201cpagnes\u201d as well as fabrics for men\u2019s clothing), shoes etc. She purchases dyed bazins and sends them to Diabali for her mother to sell; she also purchases wax pagnes, shoes, fabrics for men\u2019s clothing and other items in Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso) and sells them in front of her home and as a street vendor to a customer base composed primarily of women. She is very appreciated by her customers due to high quality of her products. IN order to satisfy growing demand, she decided to join the microfinance institution about three years ago. After three agricultural loans under the auspices of the women\u2019s association of Lobougoula (one of the remote zones covered by the  Sikasso agency), she is now on her first individual enterprise loan. All pervious loans have been properly repaid. This first individual loan will allow her to purchase 10 sets of dyed basins, four sets of pagnes was and 3 sets of fabric for men\u2019s clothing. Thanks to this loan, she plans to achieve a monthly revenue of 70,000 West African Francs, which will be used mainly towards covering family expenses and paying her loan interest, with the remainder reinvested in her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":593762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Purchasing clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-29T07:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180851,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476821,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613533,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751962,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606217,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917889,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-29T09:05:25Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228067,"name":"Mrs. Yorn Kung Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eleven people make up this village bank loan and they live in Sam Raong village in Takeo province.

Her intention is to increase her working capital so she can purchase 20 lengths of pagne wax (typical West-African clothing fabric) and 15 sets of embroidered clothes, etc.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to attain monthly earnings of 85,000 FCFA she will mainly use to increase her working capital, contribute towards family expenses and pay off her loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":593772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"Buy clothing (pagnes wax, embroidered fabric, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-29T07:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180852,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476823,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613535,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751964,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606219,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917891,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":51702.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360840,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-29T13:46:30Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228072,"name":"Nulu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nulu Z. is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kasubi, in the Kampala region of Uganda.  She is married and has 2 children, one of whom is currently in school.  She has a business running a salon, which she has had for 1 year.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Nulu has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more braids to use.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, she hopes to generate greater profits and pay for school fees and food.  In the future, Nulu hopes to expand her business further and eventually purchase a house.  She is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by showing her how to learn about customers and to be patient. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new type of loan to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance, and offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":593774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

With her loan, the latter is planning to buy 30 barrowloads of cassava which will be made into ati\u00e9k\u00e9. She gets her supplies from the market in Loulouni and in neighboring villages. The ati\u00e9k\u00e9 is sold on a retail and wholesale basis at the market in Loulouni to a customer base made up of men and women, for cash.\r\n\r\nShe is expecting to make an average monthly profit of 35,000FCFA, of which part will be used for savings in order to cover her family's daily needs and the rest invested in her business.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

In exchange for their work they are given five food servings which are of great help to feed their families.\r\n\r\nTen years ago, however, she started to sell chicken soup and other typical Peruvian dishes on weekends; being the hard working woman that she is, she now makes and sells Salchipapas (fried potatoes with fried chicken) at her doorstep.\r\n\r\nDuring all these years she acquired a large number of customers that like the flavor of her dishes and her good service and prefer her to others.\r\n\r\nRosa is very happy with her business because it\u2019s quite profitable.

She lives in her own house with her husband and two children.  She has worked making typical dishes for over 20 years in a stand in the market located three blocks from her home.

She has been working in this business for 4 years, and has 30 years of experience in this line of work.  In addition, she makes knitted caps, scarves and vests out of wool and thread based on orders from her customers.\r\n\r\nShe invests her daily income in the education of her minor children.  Eutemia's goal is to educate and support her children so that they can become professionals. She also wants to finish building her home and invest in putting a small shop in her home, since in the area where she lives there are no shops.\r\n\r\nThe recent loan that Edaprospo- Prosperidad granted her will be invested to acquire a pre-fabricated kiosk.

Cangmating, Sibulan, Negros Oriental. He earns his living by operating 2 businesses, a tricycle transport and a general store. Leonilo joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because he hoped for something better for his family. With the help of his past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Leonilo has been incrementally lifting his family out of poverty by the sweat of his brow. His previous loan of 17,000 PHP helped him earn a monthly profit of 4,500 PHP, raising his standard of living.  \r\n\r\n<p>For his 8th loan, Leonilo is borrowing 17,000 PHP, which he intends to use to purchase stock for his general store so that he can continue to save up for the future extension of his store and to buy a new motorcycle. Leonilo A. is a Dungganon man who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of his dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband is veterinarian.\n\nAs their children grow, their expenses grow too. Therefore, in order to provide for all the members of the family, Gulnara decided to start cattle breeding. She is applying for a loan to buy cattle that she is planning to fatten and sell at a higher price.

She successfully resold the cattle at a higher price after fattening and repaid the loan. Now she wants to continue cattle breeding and therefore is again applying for a loan in order to buy cattle for fattening and sale. She plans to spend the profits from cattle breeding on the purchase of more cattle for breeding. This is how she plans to significantly increase the number of her cattle.\n\nAlymkul K. is fifty and married. She has five children: her sons are fifteen and twenty-five and her daughters are twelve, twenty and twenty-four years old. Her husband is veterinarian. She is also engaged in cattle breeding.

She plans to divide the profits from cattle breeding and use part of them on the payment of her daughter\u2019s tuition fees to the institution of higher education and another part on the purchase of more cattle.\n\nAida Z. is thirty-three and married. She has two children: her daughter is ten and her son is twelve. Both of them go to school. Her husband is a builder and Aida is a teacher at the local school. Still, they decided to breed cattle two years ago in order to make additional income. They applied for a loan and bought cattle. However, they want to continue to increase the number of their cattle and therefore they are applying for a loan. With the profits from cattle breeding, Aida wants to reinvest in cattle breeding and spend some on the continuation of her house construction.\n\n\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\n\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

The loan amount will help him to buy raw materials used in manufacturing shoes in larger quantities, which will help him fulfill larger orders on time. \r\n\r\nZarina is hopeful that her family business will grow as a result of investing money into it. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":594159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Purchase raw material for shoe-making business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Kasur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.115556 74.446667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T14:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":45000,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4090}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177360413,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177360414,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182495088,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188630001,"comment":null},{"amount":50.01,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191372930,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195790384,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201232170,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206098612,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211169015,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216451759,"comment":null},{"amount":49.99,"local_amount":4090,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4269.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221615714,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-03T16:50:46Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:18:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228277,"name":"Gulmira's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulmira M. is leader of the group.

She is married to Felix O., a charcoal dealer, and the mother of four children. One of their children is already working; one is in college, and the other two are in high school. By the grace of God, Helen has managed to support her older children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to send her two youngest children to college. A dream for most Filipino parents like Helen as she herself has been a college graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nHelen operates a charcoal retailing business. In the Philippines, many still use the old ways of cooking (on an earthen stove where charcoal is used) to save money. Charcoal is much cheaper than LPG fuel, which in the current market costs as much as 600 Philippine pesos (PHP), so many people prefer to buy charcoal, which is so cheap that it can be bought for 5 PHP per pack. More people are also switching to firewood, which can be foraged or found in the trash. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of charcoal in sacks to be repackaged and retailed to her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nHelen dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her family and community with her as she continues to serve the Lord Almighty through her business.

Nghi\u00eam Th\u1ecb (20201020055) is a 50 year-old woman living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh. She is married and has three adult children. To making a living, H. owns a specialized retail store selling metal and metal-related products. H. has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3.500.000 VND a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA which was used to purchase additional products to sell. H. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be the second taken out by H. from SEDA.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA: The mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.

lives in a small city near Lahore, Pakistan called Kasur, which is known for its leather industry. She is 40 years old, married to M. A. and is the mother of three sons and two daughters. She lives in a three room brick house with her family. Shamim is a business woman who operates a business selling bangles. She sells bangles from her home, collects orders from different jewelry shops and supplies the bangles to them to make an income. She also sells bangles to her neighboring community and earns a good profit. \r\n\r\nShamim couldn\u2019t educate her children, except for her 12 year old son who reads to the 5th standard. It was not possible for her to afford his school fees but now her current business situation makes it possible for her to bear his education expenses. Her eldest daughter keeps herself busy doing household chores, while her eldest son supports the family financially by working in a shoe factory which pays a monthly wage. The other two are free and don't do anything. \r\n\r\nShamim has applied for a loan from Asasah for her bangles selling business.

Her main source of livelihood for the past three years has been selling goods like maize and millet in the Kanyanshande trading centre in Kihihi. It is with earnings from this business that this hardworking and determined lady has managed to sustain her family of four children. This 35-year-old dynamic business woman has reached a point where profits accruing to her business now amount to 280,000 UGX a month.

A high school graduate, and able to raise her two children as a single mother.  One child is still studying in public high school and the other one is already working. \n\nImelda operates a variety store (in the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five PHP\u2019s worth of cooking oil, or an egg). She earns a living by buying supplies wholesale and selling them at retail. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\n\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 11,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \n\nShe hopes that her kids will have a comfortable and well-off future. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\n\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":594244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","use":"buy more

She will use the money to expand the quantity and variety of her inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business, and hopes that it will continue to grow. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her work.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners & clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She also sidelines as an Avon lady, direct selling cosmetics of this popular brand. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil or an egg. She makes a profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling at a piece rate. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and people of the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 8,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Leonida dreams of giving all her children a high quality education with all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She earns her living by operating a fish-vending business. Her husband Vicente J., who is 48 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have six children who are between 5 and 24 years old. \r\n\r\nAmelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 11,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for the business so that she could continue to save up for the future and to save more for emergencies. Amelita J. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

A. is  a hardworking 48-year-old woman.

Unfortunately, in 2009, Arzykan\u2019s husband suffered a stroke and died. It was a hard blow to her, but Arzykan had to get it together and move forward. \r\n\r\nArzykan started selling vegetables at a local market. Her start as an entrepreneur was successful, but she handed the business over to her daughter whose own family was in need.\r\n\r\nAt that point, Arzykan decided to start her own business in cattle-breeding.  Using her initial capital of 15,000 KGS, she bought milch cows and started to sell milk.  Due to strong efforts, Arzykan has developed her farm and today she has two milch cows and 19 sheep.

She is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped improve her prospects for the future by teaching her how to expand a business and be self-reliant.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders:<\/b>\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva that funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.\r\n\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.\r\n\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in micro-finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":594277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

is Bibiana D., 45, a resident of Silang, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Jesus D., a farmer, and is the mother of four children, two of whom are already finished with school while the other two are currently enrolled. By the grace of God, Bibiana has managed to support her older children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her  two youngest children to college, a dream of most Filipino parents like Bibiana, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best legacy parents can leave to their children.<p>\r\n\r\nBibiana operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store retailing groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  Her store is located adjacent to her house, and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.<p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Bibiana is requesting a Php18,000 loan to buy more quantities of products such as groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

is Marisa Sto. D., 30, a resident of Silang, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Nepumoceno Sto. D., a driver. She is also the mother of two children: one in high school and one in elementary school. By the grace of God, Marisa has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send both of her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Marisa, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can give to their children.\r\n\r\nMarisa operates a variety store; she also oversees operations of their tricycle and maintains their piggery. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail prices by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries, and beverages in order to expand her product inventory. She expects an increase in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nMarisa dreams to be able to give all her children a high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year.

has been practising dairy farming for eight years in Litein town, Rift Valley, Kenya. He sells his milk to a nearby tea estate. He employs two people from his community. He also practises small-scale farming of tea which he sells to a local tea factory. He faces the challenges of lack of enough animal feed and a poor road network to the market.\r\n\r\nDavid is 43 years old. He is married with seven children who are now between the ages of 2 and 18. Six of the children attend school. \r\n\r\nDavid has requested this loan of 30,000 Kenyan shillings from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

Es su 21avo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y se compromete en pagar todas sus cuotas a tiempo, como hasta ahora lo ha hecho. Adem\u00e1s le gusta trabajar con sus compa\u00f1eras, por que son muy responsables. Con el cr\u00e9dito que solicita, es para la compra de m\u00e1s prendas, as\u00ed como telas, de ese modo incrementar su capital de trabajo.\n\n","en":"Mar\u00eda, 64, is a very hard working mother.  She\u2019s a widow and lives with her son in her own house.  For over 8 years she has sold children\u2019s clothes on credit door-to-door.  They are previously ordered by customers.\r\n\r\nShe tends to customers at all hours of the day, then, at least those who are already known to her.  As she goes about collecting payment she offers the unique items she has in stock.  In addition to this activity, she also makes comforters, sheets and pillows at home with her sister.  She also has \r\nmany pending orders for these items.\r\n\r\nBut what she likes best about her business is the contact she has with people because this distracts her.  Her greatest wish is to have a sewing workshop equipped with industrial sewing machines that produce impeccable finishings so that she can make items in quantity thus expanding her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her 21st loan with MFP and she pledges to repay all her installments on time like she\u2019s been doing to date.  Besides, she enjoys working with her fellow group members because they are very responsible.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested loan to buy more articles of clothing as well as fabric thereby increasing her working capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":594490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy more articles of clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-02T21:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":369.93},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":390.4},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":405.31},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":426.2},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":445.39},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":462.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.91},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.43},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":133.17,"local_amount":369.93,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":372.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154574,"comment":null},{"amount":157.82,"local_amount":438.4,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":441.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449886,"comment":null},{"amount":128.64,"local_amount":357.31,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":359.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588588,"comment":null},{"amount":153.43,"local_amount":426.2,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":428.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725090,"comment":null},{"amount":258.57,"local_amount":718.26,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":722.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463188,"comment":null},{"amount":68.37,"local_amount":189.9,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":191.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886593,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-05T00:15:21Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228456,"name":"Celtina Auxiliadora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La  Sra.

Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her two children. She says that her most difficult challenge is to have a stable business. In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying work.\r\n\r\nAndrea is excited to be taking her fourth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for two years, starting with selling underwear. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying shoes, accessories, underwear and an exhibitor. She will use the profits to buy school supplies, to invest in more products, and she is planning to buy a computer. She also wants to have telephone service and to have a store with all kinds of merchandise.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she needed the loan for her business.

Two of her children are married even though they still live with her.  Dina earns her living by selling beauty products and accessories of a well-known brand for the past year.  She remembers that her business was difficult to get established at first.  Now she generates a steady stream of income from her regular customers who place orders with her on a frequent basis.  She extends credit to her customers and likes those occasions when they pay on time.  What she does not enjoy is having to attract new customers since there have been several instances when she did not get paid and accumulated heavy losses.

She says she began the business just for fun, and then several years passed, and currently she not only obtains good profits from her sales, but also is able to attract new clients and sellers to offer the brand. What she likes most about her job is offering a variety of products and recommending the cosmetics that best suit her customers. She reports that she does not like walking a lot in search of new customers, but the incentives she receives from the company are very motivating for her. She finds the work pleasant, and she obtains a steady income which allows her to live comfortably. In the future, she plans to increase the number of products she offers to her customers, since she would like to increase her earnings. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and once again she promises, as in previous opportunities, to be punctual in making her payments, since she wants to continue working in her quest to get ahead. In addition, she is very grateful to all of those people who made the loan possible. Mar\u00eda plans to invest the loan she is requesting in buying a larger quantity of merchandise, including beauty products and perfumes, in addition to accessories, since she has a number of pending orders to fill. In this way, she hopes to earn more. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":594562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"Stocking more beauty products so she can fill her pending orders","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-04T19:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":106.94,"local_amount":297.05,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":299,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154580,"comment":null},{"amount":109.09,"local_amount":303.04,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":305.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449892,"comment":null},{"amount":143.97,"local_amount":399.91,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":402.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588592,"comment":null},{"amount":211.92,"local_amount":588.67,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":592.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463192,"comment":null},{"amount":109.09,"local_amount":303.04,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":305.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886598,"comment":null},{"amount":96.27,"local_amount":267.42,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":269.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326925,"comment":null},{"amount":107.64,"local_amount":298.99,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":300.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195525,"comment":null},{"amount":15.08,"local_amount":41.88,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:58Z","rounded_local_amount":42.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269296,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T13:40:43Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228487,"name":"Zolonides","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Zolonides, de 53 a\u00f1os, vive en su casa que es propia, en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su joven hija M\u00f3nica de 20 a\u00f1os, juntos habitan en una modesta morada, ubicada en un barrio populoso al norte de la ciudad.

He uses techniques in care of his fields, so that his repeat customers are very satisfied with the cocoa product he offers.  In general, he works with his beloved wife and together they make a good working team.  However, during harvest season, he needs laborers in order to harvest the fruit in an efficient and timely manner.\r\n\r\nHe makes his sales in the gathering centers of his town, and he sells at an unmatched price.

She is a very active woman and works hard to give her kids the best chance in life. Sonia prepares and sells natilla (a delicious caramelised dish), soya milk, and clothes ordered through a catalogue. She also sells Avon cosmetic products (through a beauty and perfume catalogue), and tupperware, which she says is of very good quality and reaps very good financial rewards. \r\n\r\nSonia divides her time between her house and her work, which, according to Sonia, makes her a mother and father at the same time! But, Sonia does not mind this as she says it is thanks to God that she has her job and does not want for anything. \r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy clothes and other products for making natilla. \r\n \r\nThis is Sonia\u2019s third loan with the Espoir foundation of which she is very happy to be a part. Sonia would like to buy a car to be able to take her children to school and carry out deliveries.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Justine Raymond, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":594586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy trousers\/pants, blouses, shirts, milk, sugar, eggs, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T07:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":990,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":123.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":123.75,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113590,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":123.75,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407333,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":123.75,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407334,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":123.75,"processed_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388446,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":123.75,"processed_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388447,"comment":null},{"amount":125,"local_amount":123.75,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388448,"comment":null},{"amount":250,"local_amount":247.5,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682867,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-09-07T20:09:53Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":228498,"name":"Vii","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vii T. is 74 and married with 10 children.

They have seven children between 21 and 40 years old. \r\n\r\nMatea joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21000 to buy feed, vitamins for the pigs and as additional capital for fish-vending so that she can continue to save up for the future and to support her family. Matea C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).
