is 42 years old and lives with her husband and two children in Govi-Altai province, Mongolia. She and her family live together in a ger, the Mongolian nomadic tent. Her husband, Boldbaatar, is 44 years old and is a carpenter. Her oldest son, Purevsuren, is 18 years old and attends university. Her youngest child, Munhnaran, is eight years old and attends a local secondary school. During the day, Bolormaa operates a vegetable trading business at a local market called Shine-Altai. She started her business in 1999 with working capital of 200,000 tugrugs (~140 USD). After years of successful operations, she has managed to increase her working capital to a level exceeding 3,000,000 tugrugs (~2111 USD) today.

Sanubar is asking for a loan of 2,000 AZN to buy butter and other ingredients for baking cakes, shekerbura, pakhlava, \"qogal\" (a sweet roll), etc. in order to improve her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":517811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To buy butter and other baking ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Absheron region","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":30,"posted_date":"2010-03-31T10:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanubar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":2000,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-05-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":200.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136706199,"comment":null},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:52:05Z","rounded_local_amount":200.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188716957,"comment":null},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":200.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195878336,"comment":null},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":200.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201319580,"comment":null},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:27:53Z","rounded_local_amount":200.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206188953,"comment":null},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":200.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211262516,"comment":null},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":200.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216542455,"comment":null},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":200.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221710973,"comment":null},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:47:44Z","rounded_local_amount":200.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227081341,"comment":null},{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":200.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232843012,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-06T21:16:37Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:38:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":190615,"name":"Virgita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virgita is a single mother to a three year-old child.

Most of them live in large traditional families and, on average, are 43 years old and have four children. They all live in Darabougou, a village located in the rural municipality of Sako\u00efba (fourth administrative region of Mali). They know each other through ties of kinship, marriage or neighborhood, or because they are members of the same traditional women's association for mutual aid in their village.\r\n\r\nThis is the first solidarity loan with Soro Yiriwaso for the members of Benkadi Group. The women have various trading activities. A few of them buy and sell firm round cabbages, shea butter, calabashes and henna.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Mrs Yama C.. She excels in the preparation and sale of food dishes, such as millet fritters and bean tidbits. She will use her loan to buy 50 kilograms of small millet, 10 kilograms of beans, 4 liters of oil, half a package of yeast, 3 kilograms of sugar and 2 kilograms of iodized salt, in her village and at the weekly fair in S\u00e9gou. She explained to us how she prepares her dishes:\r\n\r\n<i>Yama's recipe for millet fritters:<\/i> Pound the millet, remove the bran and wash thoroughly. Take part of it and mash it. Add this pulp to the flour previously obtained  through pounding and  knead. Add salt, sugar and yeast to the mixture. Fry the pulp in oil. Do this early in the morning and serve for breakfast.\r\n\r\n<i>Yama's recipe for bean tidbits:<\/i> Transform the beans into flour. Add a few pinches of salt and stir vigorously.

On average, they are 37 years old and have four children. They all live in Darabougou, a village in the rural community of Sakoiba (4th administrative region of Mali). They know each other through parent, marriage, and neighbor connections. This group of women works with condiments (tomato concentrate, onions, etc.), in the restaurant business, and makes pasta from buckwheat flour, Fatoumata M.'s specialty. In order to meet their customers' needs, they decided to join Soro Yiriwaso; they are asking for their first loan together.\r\nFatoumata M. has made wholewheat spaghetti with the help of a manual machine for five years. She plans on using this loan to buy 25 kg of flour, 2 kg of salt, and other ingredients. To make spaghetti each day, she kneads 4 kg of flour until it forms a smooth, homogeneous paste. With her machine, she transforms this paste into spaghetti of varying thickness which she dries on cotton canvas mats.  The pasta is protected by a light, white fabric for sanitary purposes. The spaghetti is measured with a ladle, bagged, and sent to restaurants. \r\nFatoumata receives many orders, especially during social events. She stocks up weekly on ingredients at the grand market in S\u00e9gou and sells her product from her home and at the market. Her customers are both men and women. She plans on making a monthly profit of 10,000 FCFA which will be used to repay the loan and meet her family's small needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":517839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of buckwheat flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Darabougou S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-03T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alimata            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koni                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan          Foun\u00e9  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":26501.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746597,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:28Z","rounded_local_amount":26501.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779147,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":26501.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961349,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":26501.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699465,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":26501.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913384,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":26501.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180556,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-03T21:52:41Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":190636,"name":"Isata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isata K. is married to a diamond miner.

Prefecture (region of Sikasso) with her husband, her co-wife, and their children.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nNot having had the chance to attend school, she wasted no time embracing commerce at an early age at her mother's side.\u00a0 After having operated in several kinds of businesses unsuccessfully, she finally opted for buying and selling cloth and various other items about ten years ago now.\u00a0 Her fame is great because she sells a large quantity of goods in a month.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nTo satisfy her customers properly with regard to quantity and quality, she decided to turn toward the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago.\u00a0 After six solidarity loans (group loans), all correctly repaid, she is now on her first individual loan.\u00a0 With this financing, she intends to buy twenty bolts of cloth in Bamako and in Bobo (Burkina Faso).\u00a0 She sells, cash or credit accepted, in Koutiala City to a customer base composed of women and men.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nAramatou plans on making a monthly profit of 60,000 francs CFA that she envisions using for repaying the Soro Yiriwaso loan, for taking part in covering the day-to-day expenses of the family, and for investing the rest in her business. \u00a0<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

With this loan she plans to purchase five pieces of simple \"bazin\" cloth, 10 bags of \u201catieke\u201d and various other articles.\r\n\r\nShe purchases her stock in Bamako, the capital of Mali and in Bouak\u00e9 in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and sells at the Hamdallaye market in Koutiala to a customer base composed of both women and men, for cash and on credit.\r\n\r\nShe plans to achieve a monthly income of 90,000 West African Francs, which she intends to use to repay her loan to Soro Yiriwaso, contribute to the family budget and invest the remainder in her business.\r\n   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":517849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Purchasing various articles (for resale)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-05T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":100298.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779150,"comment":null},{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":100298.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961351,"comment":null},{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":100298.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699468,"comment":null},{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:10Z","rounded_local_amount":100298.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913386,"comment":null},{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":100298.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180559,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-05T18:49:07Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":190647,"name":"Phal's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phal P. is 40 years old and the president of a sixteen-member loan group in Toul Krosang village in Kandal province.

Never having had the chance to finish elementary school, Salimata did not have time to take an interest in work except for her mother's business. She has now done the same work for 11 years. Her main business is the purchase of jewelry, shoes, fabrics, and other various items. She is often solicited for her business and appreciated by the women of Koutiala. \r\nIn order to increase her commercial funds and satisfy her customers with quality work, Mrs. Salimata decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso in 2007. After two group loans which are repaid, she is on her second individual loan. The first was repaid in full. With this loan, she counts on purchasing a large quantity of necklaces and 20 pairs of shoes. She gets her stock in Bamako and often in S\u00e9n\u00e9gal. She makes her sales in the city of Koutiala to young girls and married women. Sales are made in both cash and credit. \r\nShe plans on making a monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA which she will use to repay the loan from Soro Yiriwaso, meet her needs, support her child, and invest

This school was opened in 1972 by the Wesleyan Church of Sierra Leone (WCSL) to educate the children of Mabonkani village and near-by villages. Currently, the school is staffed with eight teachers and has 318 pupils.\r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries.

She is a widow who is mother to three children, all of whom are at school. Elisabeth lives alone with her children and takes responsibility for the family's various expenses. She did not go to school. In order to provide for her needs and those of her children, Elisabeth sells fabric on a door to door basis. Furthermore, she prepares and also sells food (red corn dough) in front of the primary school in Xwlacodji. Elisabeth gets her supplies in Dantokpa, B\u00e9nin's international market. She has been carrying out this activity for 15 years and is a regular client of ALID\u00e9. She has already had six loans from ALID\u00e9 and repaid them all in full. She is requesting another loan in order to raise the level of her fabric-selling activity and in order to make more money. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

She is active in the sale of bed sheets. She was actually attracted to this business by the beauty of the sheets made by the women in Touba (a religious town 180 miles from Dakar). Accordingly, in order to find a source of income these ladies provided her with sheets which she sold to her acquaintances. Since then she has made a name for herself in this business. She would, however, like a loan of 150,000 FCFA in order to get fresh stock from her suppliers and to build up her business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

It is based in Grand Thi\u00e8s and was founded in 1992 by Ms. Maty Niakh, the network\u2019s current president. She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by the NGO OXFAM in Thi\u00e8s. She is therefore quite knowledgeable about group management, entrepreneurship, etc.\r\n\r\nThe network members are extremely devoted and meet once a month. \u00a0Beyond a membership fee, each member must pay 200 francs CFA monthly into a solidarity fund.\r\n\r\nDesiring financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. This is why their network was split into nineteen sub-groups of five persons each to ensure a better profit outcome. For the second time, they are requesting a loan of 100,000 francs per member, that is 500,000 francs per sub-group, to develop their various businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, payments are made at the monthly meetings to the group president, assisted by the group treasurer, Ms. Coumba S., who are then responsible for reimbursing U-IMCEC. In the words of its president, the network has only one single, noble objective: to fight family poverty. The network currently numbers nineteen sub-groups, each with its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the sub-group Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b011 is headed by Ms. A\u00efssatou D., a merchant at the Grand Thi\u00e8s market.\u00a0 She is 51 years old and has been selling vegetables, smoked fish, palm oil and peanut butter for thirteen years.\u00a0 Her business had begun with fabric sales.\u00a0 But, given that this business did not generate a lot of revenues at the time, she turned with regret to selling vegetables and in other districts at first. \r\n\r\nMs. A\u00efssatou D. is actually in this sub-group with Ms. Rokhaya D., the treasurer and a vendor of fresh fish;\u00a0 Ms. Diakh\u00e8re S., a vendor of palm oil and fish;\u00a0 Ms. Dior T., who sells <i>ni\u00e9b\u00e9<\/i> (black-eyed peas) and dried fish;

It is based in Grand Thi\u00e8s and was founded in 1992 by Ms. Maty Niakh, the network\u2019s current president. She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by the NGO OXFAM in Thi\u00e8s. She is therefore quite knowledgeable about group management, entrepreneurship, etc.\r\n\r\nThe network members are extremely devoted and meet once a month.  Beyond a membership fee, each member must pay 200 francs CFA monthly into a solidarity fund.\r\n\r\nDesiring financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. This is why their network was split into nineteen sub-groups of five persons each to ensure a better profit outcome. For the second time, they are requesting a loan of 100,000 francs per member, that is 500,000 francs per sub-group, to develop their various businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, payments are made at the monthly meetings to the group president, assisted by the group treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck, who are then responsible for reimbursing U-IMCEC. In the words of its president, the network has only one single, noble objective: to fight family poverty. The network currently numbers nineteen sub-groups, each with its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nMs. Yarame N. is the president of Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b010.  She is 58 years old and has three children.  She has been selling vegetables and dried and smoked fish at the market for two years. However, with her part of the loan, she plans on buying a refrigerator to start selling ice. \r\n\r\nThe treasurer is Ms. Isseu F. who sells vegetables and dried fish.  And the others are Ms. Ndeye Fatou C., an itinerant vendor of cloth;  Ms. Madame Khady D., who sells vegetables; and Ms. Codou N., a vendor of vegetables and fryer chickens.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":517884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Developing their respective businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-04-04T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yarame","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Codou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isseu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":62686.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759337,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":62686.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790851,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":62686.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971285,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":62686.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708560,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":62686.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922605,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":62686.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189113,"comment":null},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T12:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":62686.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484542,"comment":null},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":62686.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620786,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-17T10:53:37Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":190683,"name":"Parvin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parvin D. was born in 1966.

Elle connait, ainsi, bien la gestion de groupe, entreprenariat \u2026etc.  Les membres du r\u00e9seau sont extr\u00eamement d\u00e9vou\u00e9s et se rencontrent une fois par mois. Ainsi, apr\u00e8s des frais d\u2019adh\u00e9sion au groupement, chaque membre est tenu de cotiser mensuellement 200 FCFA pour une caisse de solidarit\u00e9.\nSouhaitant se financer, elles d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent  d\u2019adh\u00e9rer \u00e0  U-IMCEC. C\u2019est ainsi que,  leur r\u00e9seau se voit scinder en 19 sous groupes de 5 personnes  pour un meilleur profit des financements. Elles sollicitent pour une deuxi\u00e8me fois un pr\u00eat de 100 000 FCFA par membre,  soit 500 000 FCFA par sous groupe afin de d\u00e9velopper leurs diverses activit\u00e9s.\nCependant, les r\u00e8glements sont vers\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente assist\u00e9e par la tr\u00e9sori\u00e8re du groupe, Madame Coumba Seck, pendant leurs r\u00e9unions mensuelles et ces deux se chargent \u00e0 leur tour de rembourser U-IMCEC.

It is based in Grand Thi\u00e8s and was founded in 1992 by Ms. Maty Niakh, the network\u2019s current president. She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by the NGO OXFAM in Thi\u00e8s. She is therefore quite knowledgeable about group management, entrepreneurship, etc.\r\n\r\nThe network members are extremely devoted and meet once a month.  Beyond a membership fee, each member must pay 200 francs CFA monthly into a solidarity fund.\r\n\r\nDesiring financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. This is why their network was split into nineteen sub-groups of five persons each to ensure a better profit outcome. For the second time, they are requesting a loan of 100,000 francs per member, that is 500,000 francs per sub-group, to develop their various businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, payments are made at the monthly meetings to the group president, assisted by the group treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck, who are then responsible for reimbursing U-IMCEC. In the words of its president, the network has only one single, noble objective: to fight family poverty.

C) as its name indicates is a network of women who engage in trading. It is based in Grand Thies and was set up since 1992 by Madam Maty Niakh, the current chairwoman of the network. This woman got this idea at the end of a training course that she had received from an NGO OXFAM in Thies. Thus, She knows group management, entrepreneurship etc. The members of the network are extremely dedicated and they meet once in a month. So, each member is required to make a monthly contribution of 200 FCFA to a mutual fund after subscription fees to the network. Hoping to finance themselves, they decided to join U-IMCEC. Their network was thus split to 19 sub-groups of 5 individuals in order to take better advantage of the funding. They are each requesting for the second time a loan of 100 000FCFA that is 500 000FCFA for each sub-group in order to grow their various businesses. Meanwhile, payments are made to the chairwoman assisted by the treasurer of the association, Madam Coumba Seck, during their  monthly meetings. These two are required, in turn, to repay U-IMCEC. This network, says the chairwoman, has only one noble objective:  fight poverty in the household. Currently, the network has 19 sub-groups with each having a chairwoman  and a treasurer.  Femmes Commercantes  No 9 is directed by Oumy N.. She 's been selling couscous made of millet for 20 years.

D. M. is 56 years old and lives in the Citadel neighborhood called the 20th of July in the South of Barranquilla, in a commercial, high-occupancy district, where co-exists private residences, businesses, supermarkets and mobile and stationary businesses. Edilsa is a mother to three children, ages 28 to 32, and has several business enterprises: preparing and selling natural juices, and working with assistant selling fried foods, where she works from 8 in the morning until 8 in the evening. She also sells clothing, stockings and cosmetics, during the course of her day. \r\nEdilsa comes from San Pedro in the Sucre State where she was previously working in family homes while her husband worked operating heavy machinery. When he became unemployed, they decided to move to Barranquilla to \"try their luck.\" Edilsa started her business twelve years ago with her husband, who now works in Venezuela. She learned by experience watching others and taking into account her customers' tastes. \r\nTwo years ago, Edilsa received her first loan with the Foundation. She says the financing from the two loans has helped her improve her level of life and that of her family. They are getting out from under their expensive debts. She plans to invest the 2,000 CPO she's requesting to borrow to buy a variety of natural fruits to make juices, as well as to purchase staples such as flour and oil to fry foods, and to buy paper goods, clothing and cosmetics for her merchandise business. Edilsa dreams of having a printing business with her son, his girlfriend and a cousin. This dream is also her biggest challenge because in addition to two computers and a display case that she has, it will require her to purchase another computer, a photocopier and a laminator.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jo Longnecker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":505571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buy natural fruits to make juices, basics for frying (flour and oil)  and to purchase business supplies such as paper, clothing and cosmetics.

P. lives in the Los Almendros neighborhood in the town of Soledad, which is located south of Barranquilla.  She has a store called \u201cDonde Patty\u201d where she sells foods, meats, soft drinks, sweets, and other miscellaneous general goods.  She is married and has 4 children who range in age from 8 to 26.  Even though this is Patricia\u2019s first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, she already knows that it is both important and useful to invest the loan in her business; Patricia's husband has a very good credit history, and she now wants to start building her own credit history.  She is going to use this loan of 2,300,000 Colombian pesos to purchase two tables and chairs, and to stock her business with beverages and foods such as rice and sugar in large quantities.\r\n\r\nPatricia comes from Piedecuesta, a town in the department of Santander in the country\u2019s interior.  This is panela country (an area that produces panela, which is basically a loaf of unrefined sugar), where, as Patricia says, you can meet people who are very hardworking and innovative who \u201cput our shoulders toward the sun.\u201d\r\n\r\nPatricia worked in restaurants until her husband proposed to her\u2014she then left her job and the two of them borrowed some money so that they could set up a store in Piedecuesta.  Her husband also worked as a telephone network and Internet maintenance technician, though that was not going so well since he only occasionally got contracts.  In 2001 an important company hired Patricia\u2019s husband, and he suggested that they move to Barranquilla; they thus sold their store in Santander and purchased a house in Soledad, which is where their new store is located.  Patricia\u2019s most important challenge is making some adjustments to her business so that she can expand it and be able to offer services to families who shop at her store.  Overcoming this challenge will allow her to fulfill her dream of paying for her house through her own hard work, which will in turn help her to live a stable life and have good health.\r\n<br

She is the coordinator for her group, Union y Amor (Union and Love), and her story is representative of those in her group and other Dominican and Haitian borrowers at Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nYolanda and her husband live with their two children in a simple home in El Seybo, a rural town in the agricultural east of the Dominican Republic. Life in rural areas of the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare, among other dangers. Despite these difficulties, Yolanda runs a successful business selling gas and motor oil to her community. Since there are no gas stations in the countryside, she can charge a small markup and make a healthy profit.\r\n\r\nThis is Yolanda\u2019s ninth loan with Esperanza International. With her access to capital, she hopes to continue improving her business. This loan is five times as large as Yolanda\u2019s first loan, a true testament to her hard work and the growth of her business. With profits, Yolanda is hoping to soon add a bathroom to her home. Construction in the Dominican Republic is done in stages as money becomes available. Having a bathroom will add more comfort and provide better sanitation for Yolanda\u2019s family.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families from poverty through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope. We have over 8,500 active associates in eleven offices in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

She is 49 years old and over the course of her life she has managed to raise a beautiful family of four children -  three who work and the youngest who is studying medicine. Her husband left home, but this has not been the reason to keep motivated since she has the support of her children economically and morally. She used to work in upholstery, but then she resigned and started to buy new clothes for women. She is also an Avon representative and sells a variety of products such as creams, perfumes, makeup, beauty products, facials and other things. She sells for cash and two-week credit. Her goal is to be able to buy a display cabinet so that she can display her products and keep winning customers. With this investment she will buy clothes as she does not have many and she has some orders to buy. In the future she would like to improve the structure of her home for better security since the walls are not even made of concrete.

a big city like New York it can be very difficult to find a babysitter; people generally rely on word of mouth. With her entrepreneurial spirit, Melody saw an unfilled need and decided to launch a babysitting placement service in April, 2008. \r\n\r\nMelody's business has brought independence to her life. The flexibility of being her own boss allows her to still continue her career as a singer and performer in New York City and spend more time with her son.\r\n\r\nMelody found traditional bank loans too costly and difficult to acquire. She was recommended to ACCION USA for an affordable, small business loan. Melody will use her ACCION USA loan to purchase another computer for her growing staff, to provide age-appropriate toys for babysitters, and to ramp up her promotional efforts. Her vision is to expand her babysitting service; therefore, creating more jobs and at the same time raising awareness on the importance of child development.\r\n\r\n<b>About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the new caf\u00e9 on your corner and the delivery service that brings the fresh baked goods acquired the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. \r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":516652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child

Romana, Dominican Republic.  She is the coordinator for her group called Cristo y Nuestro Esfuerzo (Christ and Our Strength).  Her story is representative of those in her group and other Dominican and Haitian borrowers at Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nMaritza is a single mother who lives with her two children in a simple home near L. Romana.  Their small rural community was built by sugar companies for their field workers.  Life is extremely difficult, with no potable running water, daily power outages and inadequate access to health care, among other dangers.  Despite these difficulties, Martiza runs a successful small business selling clothing in her community. With this loan, she will purchase undergarments, shoes, and pants to sell at a small markup.\r\n\r\nThis is Maritza\u2019s second loan with Esperanza International.  She hopes to continue to grow her business.  Maritza is excited to continue investing in her business and family with the profits she earns.  Her profit will help her make household purchases like food and school supplies for her children.  Maritza is now confident that her children will have bright futures; a luxury she did not have before receiving access to business loans.\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families from poverty through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope. We have over 8,500 active associates in eleven offices in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

Finally, we can say that she is a responsible person, previously was also a cliente of Kiva, and did not have setbacks in her payments.  With the loan money, she will buy wool for the knitting she does.  She is very thankful to Emprender and Kiva for the trust offered in granting the loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin K., Kiva

He is asking for 10,000 meticais, which he will use to buy cement, gravel and sand to make concrete brinks and sell them at his stand.  He promises to pay off this loan on time so he can take out more loans.

He lives in his own house with his family, and isn't financially responsible for anyone else.\r\nWith his parents, he left Gaza for Boane in search of better living conditions. He's had his own business for more than 8 years with no other employees. The business brings in between 2500 and 3000 meticals a month, which she uses for household expenses.\r\nShe's never received loans from other banks. She learned about Hvuluku from friends who are also Hvuluku clients. This is her second loan, in the amount of 10,000 meticals, which she will use to purchase merchandise (bundles of used clothing) in order to increase the quantity of her stock. Her previous loan was for 6000 meticals, which he needed for the same purpose. \r\nHe's committed to paying this loan off on time so that he'll be eligible for others in the future.

With this he has been able to shoulder the responsibility of taking care of his eight children, principally facilitating their education. His coffee and banana business which he operates in Katooma, Kayonza, Ntungamo, has made enormous strides that he did not envisage at the beginning.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s for that reason that this happily-married man wants to consolidate the gains he has made. His dream is to see significant increases in the amount of coffee and bananas he sells to his increasing client base. He also wants to improve on the current welfare of his family.

(who is in the bottom left corner of the photo) has a kiosk in the Bwiza Neighborhood of the town of Bujumbura where she sells various items but principally manages a public telephone booth, also selling charge cards for mobile phones. To respond to her customers' demand, she intends to use her Turame loan to buy foodstuffs that she has never sold before now. She is confident that the diversification of her inventory will raise her profit.  \r\n\r\nFarida is 28 years old. After her secondary studies, she began to work as a secretary for a company selling mobile phones in Bujumbura. In May 2009, she opened her own little shop. \r\n\r\nFarida is married and the mother of 2 little girls. The older is five and is enrolled in her third year of kindergarden and the younger is two.  Farida is responsible for two other girls, aged 15 and 14, whom she brought back from the Congo (DRC) because their parents were not able to support them.  \r\n\r\nFarida has one wish for her children: to see them succeed and live a very good life. She would also like to continue her studies in medicine, but she lacks the funds to do so. She would like to become a doctor or a nurse. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

She is currently on her 13th loan cycle. She is 41 years old, divorced and the mother of seven children: four of them attend school, one is trained as a mechanic and two are too young to go to school. It is worth noting that she provides only for her children, because her ex-husband has completely left her.\r\n\r\nMasika's business consists of small-scale production of the traditional drink \"Mandrakwa\", which is made from corn with local technology. She began this activity with a start capital of US$60, just after the eruption of Nyiragongo Volcano in January 2002 had destroyed the whole economic infrastructure in the city of Goma. Thus she produced for 8 years \"Mandrakwa\" in her traditional production style.\r\n\r\nShe came to the microfinance institution Hekima and applied for this loan, which she will use to buy 32 sacks of corn to bolster her production capacity and increase her turnover. In addition, she wants to open a small store and buy a minibus for city transportation, since her oldest son has just finished his apprenticeship in automobile mechanics.\r\n\r\nMasika is thankful to MFI Hekima for the loans granted to her without any physical guarantee, because these loans enabled her to provide for her children and gradually build up some savings for her family.\r\n\r\nThis group is composed of 12 members, 11 women and 1 man, all pictured.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva

She is 43 years old, married, and has two children aged nine and 12. She could not continue her education through 6th grade because her parents did not value education. For five years, Seatta has sold food stuffs such as rice, oil, beef, and soft drinks at Rossville in Bomi County, Liberia. She has a good way with customers which keeps them returning. Seatta started by selling palm oil and her working capital was 1,000.00 Liberian Dollars. She plans to use her 5,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 25,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more rice, oil, seasonings, beef, and salt for sale. Her goal is to grow her business to a store and give her children higher education.\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP: The Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.

Like many others, she needs to generate income through informal employment such as buying goods at wholesale prices from the markets in the country's interior in places such as Oruro,  and reselling them at a profit.   Corina has 3 children who attend school, one of whom will soon finish secondary school.  Right now, they are living in the home of Corina's parents. With the increase in unemployment in the country, Corina's husband had to leave the family to look for work.  While he looked for work in Spain, Corina realized it was her obligation to look for work that could help sustain the family.  In the beginning, her mother allowed her to locate a small shop in her house, but this wasn't sufficient to generate the income needed.   Corina needed to find new opportunities such as her wholesale business.   Corina dreams of being able to increase her income so that she can open her own market.

This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.

P. is a 27-year old married woman who lives in Canlinday Barangay, Culipapa Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by engaging in a fishing and fish-vending business.\r\n\r\nJuliet\u2019s husband, Roldan, works as a fisherman and they have 5 young children, aged between 8 months & 7 years. The couple work hard to sustain the needs of their family, especially in preparation for the future well-being of their children. \r\n\r\nJuliet joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 in the hopes that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in fishing and fish-vending business. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nJuliet is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 was used to fund operations of her fishing and fish-vending business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing, for her 7th cycle loan, the amount of PHP 19,500, which she intends to use on her existing fishing and fish-vending business. Juliet is working hard to achieve the dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":516882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

This is why their network was split into nineteen sub-groups of five persons each to ensure a better profit outcome. For the second time, they are requesting a loan of 100,000 francs per member, that is 500,000 francs per sub-group, to develop their various businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, payments are made at the monthly meetings to the group president, assisted by the group treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck, who are then responsible for reimbursing U-IMCEC.

Actuellement, le r\u00e9seau compte 19 sous groupes avec chacun une pr\u00e9sidente et une tr\u00e9sori\u00e8re.\nPour les Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b017, Madame Fatou Kin\u00e9 D. est la pr\u00e9sidente.

","en":"As its name suggests, Femmes Commer\u00e7antes is a network of businesswomen. It is based at Grand Thi\u00e8s and was created in 1992 by Ms. Maty Niakh, its current president. She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by Oxfam at Thi\u00e8s, in which she became familiar with group organization and running a business. The members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month. Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a group solidarity fund.\r\n\r\nLooking for financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people so that financing can be better handled. Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various activities. The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck. They, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC. According to the president, the group\u2019s praiseworthy objective is to fight family poverty.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fatou Kin\u00e9 D. is the president of \"Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b0 17\". She is 43 years old and the mother of four children. She chose to interrupt her studies early on to embark upon commercial ventures. Currently she retails shoes, clothing fabric, handbags, buckets, and gets her supplies as far away as Gambia. She shares this sub-group with its treasurer Mrs. Nd\u00e8ye Coumba S., who retails vegetables at the central market in Thies, Mrs. Khady L. and Mrs. Nd\u00e8ye Ngon\u00e9 D.  who both sell ice cream at the bus station, and Mrs. Fagui D. who is a seamstress.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":518886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"Resupply merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-04-06T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou Kin\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nd\u00e8ye Ngon\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fagui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nd\u00e8ye Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759346,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790865,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:30Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971298,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708574,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922618,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189126,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T12:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484554,"comment":null},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620799,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-04-07T18:11:51Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":190996,"name":"Kike","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kike sells frozen food like chicken parts, turkey parts and more.
