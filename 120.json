the years prior to 1990, the financial situation of Ms. D. Thi Dai's family was met with difficulties and hardship. Her children were young and unable to help out the family. She did not farm and did some miscellaneous sales at the market, enough only to feed the family. In 1998 she joined TYM and her first loan was 30.00 USD to raise and sell chicken and raise pigs with average monthly income of 42.00 USD. After 10 years borrowing from TYM, she invested in retail business and raising animals which provided her family with a stable income and greatly improved their livelihood, Presently her family has a house located right on Highway 3 so she opened a shop selling refreshment and repairing cars and motorcycles. She also raises geese and chickens, and no longer has to sell at the market. Her children are now grown and are employed with outside companies. Their family's average monthly income is 605.00 USD and with the loan term of paying weekly, she finds it very agreeable. She herself has always been exemplary in carrying out the stipulations of the fund, and is always eager to assist other women in the group.

1 acre of rice paddy, her family in the years prior to 1995 had been growing rice, as well as raising pigs and fish to expand their income. She joined TYM in 1995 and her first loan was 18.00 USD to buy additional pigs and feed. After starting to see a profit, she continued to invest in raising pigs. For the past 10 years, the loans she borrowed had been invested in raising pigs and fish, which brought in good income averaging about 1815.00 USD per year. Because of the continued improvement in her income, her children were able to go to school. Presently her family still raises pigs, and she spends about 605.00 USD in expenses and costs for a litter of 15 pigs, and brings in about 1210.00 USD for every litter. Therefore, repaying the loan every week is very agreeable for her. Besides, her husband and children also go to work and thus help increase their family's income. She wishes to borrow this time 1150.00 USD to invest in her pig farm.\r\n<b><p>Translated from Vietnamese by Thu Ostrander, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nV\u1edbi m\u1ed9t m\u1eabu ru\u1ed9ng n\u00ean nh\u1eefng n\u0103m tr\u01b0\u1edbc 1995 gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ee7 y\u1ebfu l\u00e0m ru\u1ed9ng, ngo\u00e0i ra c\u00f2n ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i l\u1ee3n th\u1ecbt, nu\u00f4i c\u00e1 gi\u1ed1ng \u0111\u1ec3 ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n kinh t\u1ebf.

Mrs. Soem S. is 26 years old and the mother of a child who is too young to work or attend school. She and her family live in an old house because they have a small income. Mrs. Soem S. would like to build a new house but does not have enough money, so she has decided to ask for a loan, which she will add to her savings to achieve her goal. Previously, Mrs. Soem S. obtained a loan from Acleda Bank to buy a new motorbike and has fully paid it back."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":189160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

So, because of this illness I spend a lot of money each month.  Thank God I have the help of my husband to get ahead, but I need to grow my business.  At this time we are selling lottery tickets and that has helped us a lot because the tickets sell a great deal in our country.  For this reason I need monetary assistance to get ahead with my business, my home and my family.Translated from Spanish by Hugh Yarbrough, Kiva Volunteer.\r\n\r\n\r\nhola como estan, mi nombre es Alba

Fortunately, she generates enough income from her business to feed her family.  Her husband died two years ago and now Maura is a single mother of two children.

He is married and the father of two children. Ferooz lives with his parents in Shewa district. His father is about 50 years old and can't work, so Ferooz works alone, but sometimes his smaller brother helps him. Ferooz is an active man, and he has accepted to support all his family.<P>\r\n\r\nAfter 18 years of living overseas, when they returned to their homeland, Afghanistan, Ferooz and his father started a small business. They had 30,000 Afghanis of their own capital, so they opened a small retail shop and purchased some goods with this money.<P>\r\n\r\nAfter a few months, his father started farming, because they could not solve all their financial problems. So Ferooz was working in his shop, and his father on the land. Recently, his father has faced some serious illness, so he had to leave off work and rest at home. This is the reason why Ferooz changed his business and bought a CD shop in the bazaar. He thinks that there is much demand for this type of goods. Therefore, he has requested AFSG for 50,000 Afghanis loan for a period of 18 months. He wants to purchase a lot of CDs, cassettes, and radios with this money and find more customers. <P>\r\n\r\nFerooz dreams that through this money he will increase his daily income and improve his business. Also, he hopes to start some computer and English language courses and become a well-educated teacher. He thanks the lenders who are helping poor people, especially when they show new business ways to the younger generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":189749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Music Discs &

In general the business is stable, having a strong trend for further development. However, Muhabbat stresses that after loans provided by the International Micro-Loan Fund IMON, she managed to accelerate the process of development of her business considerably. <P>\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, thanks to one of the loans, Muhabbat was able to rent an additional booth in the market. Today she is planning to increase her working capital in order to expand her business and thus to be able to meet all the needs of her dearest children as day by day, they are growing up and their expenses are rising, too. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this purpose in mind, Muhabbat is requesting 1200 US Dollars for a term of 10 months.

M. lives in the town of Tursun-zoda. She is 31 years old, married, and has 3 children. She has secondary education and stays at home. She had been growing rice for the past 3 years. This allows her not to purchase rice, which is usually expensive, on a market. She mainly uses her crops for her own family and sells any extras. At this point in time, Mavjuda would like to purchase quality seeds for the next sowing. After consulting with her family, she decided to take out a loan for 12 months. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva

She is requesting this loan to purchase cloth, buttons, zippers, thread, and other things she needs for the uniforms.  She is in the process of developing and expanding her business and, when she is not sewing, she spends a lot of time visiting schools to advertise and take orders from the schools and\/or the students.  She says that she works specifically in uniforms, as opposed to sewing clothing in general, because she can buy all that she needs for less because she doesn't need as much variety in the supplies and it is therefore more economical.  She currently has an order for 50 uniforms, for which she needs to buy two rolls of cloth and other supplies to be able to fulfill the order.  This loan would help her a lot with this order and in having a good stock of all her supplies to continue working and expanding her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nOlga is married and her husband works as a fireman and a nurse.  They have five children between the ages of four and twenty-two.  Although Olga only had the opportunity to study up to the third grade when she was young, the education of her children is a very important priority for her, and all her children are studying or have already graduated.  Additionally, she has worked to continue studying herself, and has studies nursing but hasn't worked as a nurse because she has been raising her children.\r\n<p>\r\nOlga has many dreams for her business and her family.  She wants to expand her business and would like to include sewing bedding, such as sheets and bedspreads.  She says that she would sew elegant and large bedspreads, as there is a lot of demand for these products.  She also wants to make improvements to her house.  She already has her own house and in a good location, but she would like to add another level.  More than anything, she dreams that her children can become professionals and have a better life.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Spanish by Megan Montgomery, Kiva Fellow.<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nOlga ha trabajado cosiendo uniformes de enfermer\u00eda por dos a\u00f1os.  Esta pidiendo este pr\u00e9stamo para comprar tela, botones, z\u00edperes, hilo, y otras cosas que necesita para los uniformes.  Ella est\u00e1 en el proceso de desarrollar y aumentar su negocio y, cuando no est\u00e1 cosiendo, pasa mucho tiempo viajando a los colegios para hacer publicidad y para tomar los pedidos de los colegios y\/o directo de los estudiantes.  Dice que trabaja espec\u00edficamente en uniformes, en vez de en la costura de ropa en general, porque se puede comprar todo que necesita por menos porque no necesita tanta variedad en las provisiones y, por eso, es mas econ\u00f3mico. En este momento tiene pedido 50 uniformes, para que necesite comprar dos rollos de tela y otras provisiones para poder cumplir con este orden.  Este pr\u00e9stamo le ayudar\u00eda mucho con este orden y en tener una buena reserva de todas las provisiones para seguir trabajando y aumentando su negocio. \r\n<p>\r\nOlga es casada y su esposo trabaja como bombero y enfermero.  Tienen cinco hijos de edades entre 4 a\u00f1os y 22 a\u00f1os.  Aunque Olga solamente ten\u00eda la oportunidad de estudiar hasta tercero b\u00e1sico cuando estuvo joven, la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos es una prioridad muy importante para ella, y todos sus hijos est\u00e1n estudiando o ya han graduado.  Adem\u00e1s, ella misma ha trabajado para seguir estudiando y ha estudiado la enfermer\u00eda pero no ha trabajado como enfermera porque ha sido cuidando sus hijos.  \r\n<p>\r\nOlga tiene muchos sue\u00f1os para su negocio y para su familia.  Quiere agrandar el negocio y le gustar\u00eda incluir la costura de ropa de cama, como sabanas y cubrecamas.

So he lost much of his capital and then his customers went elsewhere.<P>\r\n\r\nNow Amin wants to stand on his own feet once again, and he thought deeply to find a better solution for these problems. Finally, one of his relatives advised him to take a loan from AFSG and purchase enough goods for his shop. He accepted this idea and requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 Afghanis.

is a 48-year-old married entrepreneur and mother of five children.

This can be attributed to hard work, years of experience and her well-established client base. She sells a wide range of cereals including beans, dry maize, rice, millet and sorghum. The profit from the sale of these staple foods helps her pay for her children's school fees and other household expenses, especially during the slow season.  She plans to use three quarters of her next loan of US $700 to purchase an extra stock of beans and rice and put the remaining amount into her savings account to use in case of unforeseen circumstances.\r\n<p><i>\r\nDisclaimer: Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses.
