In search of a source of income for her family, she started her own business of selling food products and cleaning supplies.  She leased a retail outlet and put all of her efforts toward developing her business, and achieved success.  Zarina was able to purchase a small apartment and make repairs to it.  Today, she does not have an abundance of product selection, and, therefore, Zarina requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.  Purchase of merchandise will allow her to expand her selection, increase the number of customers and have higher sales.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Alex will educate his children, build a house and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Mungano Youth group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Alex is pictured with his group members.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":920983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-23T00:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kaitano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":71050,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71050}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T22:35:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":360165,"name":"Phin's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phin, aged 31, is married and has three children who all are still in school.

Previously, he sold vegetables wholesale and retail at a food market and then decided to change his speciality.  Since then, his income rose and currently amounts to 6 000 hryvnia.  Ivan plans to use the 7 000 hryvnia Kiva loan to buy winter tires and make regular repairs to his car engine.  This business is Ivan's primary source of income.  One of the goals that Ivan sets for himself is to purchase a newer car.  In the future, Ivan plans to continue working in this field because for now he does not see other, more interesting

Pasilisa's family includes three children. In the recent 2011 season, Pasilisa had an excellent maize yield harvesting 13 bags on 1 acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Pasilisa was only able to harvest 5 bags of maize on 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Pasilisa and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Pasilisa will pay for major yearly expenses such as school fees and livestock investments.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Mbanasho group will each plant  between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":922911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

He lives in the village of Koshelovo and owns a store called \"ABC\" located near the main road. \r\nSome time ago,Yaroslav's wife bought a house and restructured in for a business. Abut one year ago, Yaroslav opened his shop. Despite having a fledgling business, he has already achieved a great reputation among the townspeople and boasts regular customers. \r\nYaroslav needs a loan of 15,000 grivnas in order to stock up on goods before the holidays. In advance of Christmas and New Year's Eve, Ukrainians begin to spend lavishly on grocieries, therefore Yaroslav wants to be ready to meet increased demand for sweets, meat products, etc. \r\nYaroslav is full of ideas on how to expand his business. Because his store is spacious and has a separate entrance, he could rent out part of his building or, possibly, open something himself when his business allows it. One idea consists of opening a veterinary clinic, whose services would be in great demand since animal breeding is a common way to make a living for many people in that part of the country.

She lives with Emilio and their three children, who are 14, 16, and 20 years old, in a house that they own.  They were able to purchase the house with a lot of effort. \r\n\r\nEdith works selling necessity items in a general store located in her home.  She started her business with very little merchandise that she was able to buy with money she had saved.  Later, with a lot of effort and dedication, she became well known and expanded her store.  She has had this business for 20 years.  Her children help her serve her customers, who are mostly her neighbors.  The thing she likes best about her business is being able to socialize and make new friends with whom she can exchange ideas.  In addition to the income she earns that helps with household expenses, her husband works as a mototaxi driver.

He is a good man with a great desire to keep expanding his business. He lives in his own home with his partner and their child, who is 21. Their child is a student and depends on Acsel for education fees and for food. They work very hard together in order to have a better quality of life. Acsel works in a sawmill, more specifically doing marquetry (an elegant wood used for flooring and walls). Once his products are completed, he registers them and goes through all of the legal arrangements to send them to Lima, where they are then shipped abroad. Acsel also makes laths and splints; he gives them a better finish in his workshop. He travels around quite a bit but always stays at the edge of the river for easier transportation. He has been working for three years and has four workers hired to help him; he provides them with employment. This is going very well for him and up until now he has managed to follow all of the laws and keep everything in order with his business. In the beginning his business was informal and he had problems, but with time he became formalized and his business is growing more and more every day. In the future, he wants to have his own saw in the city. This will be his first loan with MFP, and he hopes for your support so that he can continue with his goals. He promises to be responsible and punctual so that he does not disappoint the communal bank. With the requested loan, he will buy more wood to continue with his work and try to export in larger quantities."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":240.35,"image":{"id":923454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to buy more wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-22T12:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Acsel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":152.15},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":159.19},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":158.57},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.03},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":177.41},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":181.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.06},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.47},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.53},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.06,"local_amount":152.15,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":154.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244622056,"comment":null},{"amount":59.69,"local_amount":159.19,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":161.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836155,"comment":null},{"amount":59.47,"local_amount":158.57,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":160.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245919,"comment":null},{"amount":64.13,"local_amount":171.03,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":173.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385947,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-11-22T23:10:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":360441,"name":"Humberto De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Humberto a sus 51 a\u00f1os de edad y padre de un hijo de 16 a\u00f1os, se dedica a transportar en su  propia camioneta art\u00edculos de hogar y ropa para vender en los pueblos; adicional a esto tambi\u00e9n utiliza su veh\u00edculo para hacer encomiendas.

To improve their income, beside that from their husbands, they want to run this business at home.\r\n\r\nNi Luh, head of the Sari Wangi Ternak, has two children. The first child is still in elementary school and the second is still a toddler. Her husband works as a chili and corn farmer. Ni Luh allready has pigs, but to improve her business, she needs a loan to buy more pigs. She will use the loan to purchase three pigs and use the rest for food. She maintains the pigs for fattening. Ni Luh hope the business can run smoothly, avoid diseases and earn a profit. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":920813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase three pigs and pig feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Pejarakan - Singaraja","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2011-11-23T18:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadek","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Made ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":10000000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-24T00:28:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":360524,"name":"Sibang Sari Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Sibang Sari group is a women's group and has 10 members.

She lives in the city of Granada. She was barely able to finish the second grade of primary school, because she dedicated most of her childhood to working, since her family did not have the resources to send her to school. She is married and has 2 children. Her work is selling cashews (a forest product). She started this business when she stopped working as a domestic helper in order to become independent and have a business of her own. Also, as she became older, people did not want to hire her, and and for this reason she needed to find a way to get ahead on her own. She travels from Granada to Managua to sell her cashews on a street corner by a university, where most of her customers are students and professors. When sales are low, she goes out to the intersections with her bags of cashews, and when the light is red, she sells them from car to car. This is how she earns a living each day. \r\n \r\nShe needs the loan to buy cashews on a wholesale basis, because the capital she has is not enough to buy a larger quantity, which she needs to sell more and improve her sales.
