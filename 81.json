She sells between five and seven tons of scrap metal each week.  She also has a small sugar cane farm and employs one worker to run it.  She would use the loan to pay the salary of her farm worker, and in this way she could keep both businesses afloat.  Sarah is married and has eight children ranging in age from 17 to 2 years old.  Her husband owns a general store.  She hopes to pay for her eldest child's tuition in a business course. She would like him to become a tailor."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4875,"image":{"id":138846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"The group is made up of 20 women from the local community and has been borrowing for ten years for the women\u2019s various business enterprises.

B. lives in the Khuroson region. He is 41 years old , married and has four children. He has secondary education. His is in agriculture and has his own piece of land where he cultivates wheat, flax and other crops. He sells the crops to wholesalers which use the wheat for flour. He keeps the smaller part of a yearly supply of wheat for his family's use. Because wheat is a very important dietary product it is in very high demand. This helps develop the business with full confidence and sow large areas of land with wheat. Safarkul has been in the agriculture for the past three years. He now needs financing for buying of seeds, fertilizer and ploughing (the use of fuel and renting of equipment). He plans to pay off the loan within 10 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\u0411\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432

He is 48 years old, married and has 5 children. He has a high school degree and is a farmer. Hudoyberdy owns a plot of land where he grows wheat, flax and other agricultural crops. He sells his crops to wholesalers who grind the wheat into flower. A small part of his harvest Hudoyberdy saves for one year for his family. Since wheat flower is a main staple of the local diet, it is always in high demand. This gives Hudoyberdy confidence in his business and he wants to grow wheat in large amounts. He now needs additional funding to purchase more seeds and fertilizer as well as fuel and tractor rent to plant his fields. Hudoyberdy is planning to pay back the loan in the next 10 months\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

These purchases will permit her to increase her sales, earn more money, and respond to the needs of her children. <p>\r\nAssi A. est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 36 ans, mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 3 enfants dont la premi\u00e8re sur les bancs de l\u2019\u00e9cole primaire.

Madame A. est revendeuse des arachides, de la farine du manioc (une plante \u00e0 tubercule qui est indig\u00e8ne au Togo) et du sucre qu\u2019elle installe sous une baraque \u00e0 Avetonou, un village situ\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 120 kilom\u00e8tres de Lom\u00e9, la capitale togolaise. Elle d\u00e9sire acheter avec ce cr\u00e9dit 10 bols d\u2019arachides, 5 sacs de sucres en poudre et 2 sacs de farines de maniocs. Ceci lui permettra d\u2019augmenter ses ventes, gagner plus et r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de ses enfants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":139304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"To buy 10 bags of peanuts, 5 sacks of powdered sugar, and 2 sacks of manioc flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Avetonou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.8 0.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":99,"posted_date":"2008-03-15T11:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Assi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-29T19:50:46Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2008-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2008-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2008-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2008-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2008-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2008-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87,"local_amount":36631.58,"processed_date":"2008-04-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:45:25Z","rounded_local_amount":37204.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195696,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":87,"local_amount":36631.58,"processed_date":"2008-05-29T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":37204.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222919,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":87,"local_amount":36631.58,"processed_date":"2008-06-29T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":37204.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":252150,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":87,"local_amount":36631.58,"processed_date":"2008-07-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":37204.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":280909,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":87,"local_amount":36631.58,"processed_date":"2008-08-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T09:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":37204.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":310602,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":87,"local_amount":36631.58,"processed_date":"2008-09-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":37204.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":341652,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":83,"local_amount":34947.37,"processed_date":"2008-10-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-30T07:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":35493.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373406,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":85.91,"local_amount":36172.27,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:20:59Z","rounded_local_amount":36737.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5313458,"comment":null},{"amount":86.36,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:28:49Z","rounded_local_amount":36932.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9931114,"comment":null},{"amount":86.36,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:00:44Z","rounded_local_amount":36932.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14855734,"comment":null},{"amount":86.37,"local_amount":36363.6,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":36932.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20395234,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-03-15T19:50:46Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T08:18:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":40515,"name":"Mahmadisso","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"Mahmadisso G. lives in the Abdurahmon Jomi.

Flax oil is a popular product so Dilshod\u2019s business is profitable and at the same time, his business provides people with this popular product. Dilshod has been in this business for 6 years. He plans to use his loan to stock up with flax grain, since the prices are rising, as the supply of flax is limited.
