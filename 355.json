Here is a story about one woman, which is an example of bravery and self-confidence. \r\n<br>After her marriage, Tynymkan M. never dreamed she would suffer. As the eldest child in her family, she was responsible \u2013 and that is why she did not think much about marriage. However, kidnapping is common in the country; Tynymkan was kidnapped, but she still thought about her family and her brothers and sisters. Unless her siblings married, she took care of them. She also decided to take care of herself because she was getting older. \r\n<br>Finally, Tynymkan gave birth, little knowing that her happiness would not last much longer. Her husband died the same year from a heart attack. At that moment, it seemed her life was totally destroyed. However, her child motivated her to move on. Her son became an adult and graduated from university. But life is very cruel, and on the way home, he fought with a group of scum who mutilated him forever. He is now 40 years old and an invalid.\r\n<br>The situation was unimaginable. However, Tynymkan took a loan of 15,000 KGS and bought three sheep for fattening and reselling. Now her life is not so bad, and she is requesting another loan to increase her number of cattle in order to sell them and help her child.\r\n<p>\r\nAynagul B. is 39 and married. She has five children, and her husband works as a welder for a company. Her elder daughter works in a caf\u00e9 as a waitress while the rest are still at home. Five years ago, they bought some cattle with her husband's salary and began their business. They are planning to increase their number of cattle so that they can educate their children. They want to take a loan in order to buy fodder.\r\n<p>\r\nAynur J. is 39, a widow, and has two children who both attend the local school. She is planning to apply for a job and marry successfully. She is requesting a loan for dental treatment.\r\n<p>\r\nAygul J. is 38, married, and has five children. Her husband works as a driver in a company. She wants a loan to buy building materials in order finish their house.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

Evangeline has successfully repaid a previous loan of 45,000 PHP from PMPC.  She is now requesting a new loan of 36,000 PHP which will be used to redeem her coconut plantation. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Evangeline from PMPC.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The coldest place in Kyrgyzstan is Naryn. In the period of the Soviet Union, Naryn was the capital, because everything was imported firstly to Naryn. Although Naryn is the coldest place, people there are very kind. Their hospitality is amazing. In spite of crisis, even now, they may cut a sheep for one guest. Whole families can be fed for about a month by one sheep, but citizens of Naryn may cut it for one person in order to show that he is welcome.  \r\n\r\nJanylbubu K. is just like this. She is a kind, open-minded person. Because she gives something, God is giving her. God already gave her health; besides that, He gave her a really hardworking husband and brilliant son. She adores them because they are really good friends and her best supporters. Her husband is on pension but still works at home as a joiner and makes fascinating items. A simple piece of wood can turn out to be a beautiful souvenir. It is his hobby but, at same time, it provides an opportunity to earn their daily bread. They bought a joiner bench and began their business. Later on, with the money they earned (about 5,000 soms or $112), they bought cattle. Now their revenue is 4,000 soms ($90). They are planning to build a house and marry off their son. They decided to take out a loan to buy raw materials.\r\n\r\nSabira O. is a 50-year-old married woman. She has two children: a daughter and a son. Her daughter is a student and her son also attends school. Her husband is a taxi driver. They want to take out a loan to buy two tonnes of coal. With the rest of the money, they will buy sheep.\r\n\r\nCholpon O. is a 54-year-old married woman. Her two children attend the local school and her husband works as an electrician at the school. They want to take out a loan to buy coal. Their plan is to buy a house for their son.\r\n\r\nAynagul M. is a 57-year-old married woman. She has five children: four of them live separately and her youngest daughter is a student. Her husband is a joiner who makes frames and doors. Their revenue is 3,000 soms ($67). They want to buy a horse \u2013 that\u2019s why they need a loan.\r\n\r\nSuusar B. is a 50-year-old married woman. She has two sons. The older one is 25; he is a tractor driver and helps his father. The younger one is a student. They are planning to build a house for their sons and increase the number of their cattle. They want to take out a loan to buy a cow and, with the rest, they are planning to buy coal. \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3 P's concept: <b>P<\/b>eople (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), <b>P<\/b>rofit (to be profitable to grow further) and the <b>P<\/b>lanet (taking care of the environment).

A 31-year-old mother of two kids, she lives in the town of Angono, Rizal Province, in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nJoy\u2019s main goal is to build a sustainable business to meet the needs of her children; she was thus encouraged to join ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), a MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2001. The previous loans she received from Kiva were carefully invested in her restaurant. Since then, the restaurant has been performing well and earning sufficient profit. She is grateful that she has been able to educate her children using proceeds from her business as she continues to expand. Joy needs a loan to help boost her business for increased profit.\r\n\r\nNow requesting her sixth loan, she is requesting 40,000 pesos as additional capital for her restaurant, to be used to pay for cases of beer, liquor, pork, chicken, groceries for her enterprise and an additional videoke karaoke machine.\r\n\r\nJoy is optimistic that she can achieve her dreams of providing a good life for her children and being able to send them to school until they finish college. She also hopes to expand her business and if possible she can have a branch in the town of Taytay, Rizal, in order to provide employment to others. She hopes that these dreams will come true and that ASHI will give the best direction and opportunity to her family.\r\n\r\nShe is happy that her living condition is better than in the past because she can generate more income from the business. Joy would like to send all the best wishes to all her lenders around the world. She hopes that they will support her again in the future.\r\n\r\nAbout ASHI: Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) has the distinction of being the oldest existing replication of Grameen Bank Approach (GBA) to credit delivery to the bottom poor in the Philippines. With its outstanding achievements over the years, it has become one of the role models in credit delivery to the poor in the

The group is made up of 20 very hard-working, humble women who work every day to earn a living.\n The loan the group took out from Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya was disbursed among them, and each member invested the money in their respective business. \n One of the group members is Gloria, who sews high-fashion wedding dresses and evening gowns. Her work is impeccable and very valuable. She does very lovely embroidery and designs, so she has many clients. She used her loan to buy the materials she needs, like colored thread, beads for embroidery, and fabric. \nEach one of the group members works at their respective job to support their family:\n1.

She is married and has four children. She joined the credit union in January 2010 and has never taken out a loan. She has been selling vegetables (tomatoes, carrots, etc.) for a very long time. For the past four years, she has also been selling water from a public faucet. The management of the public water faucet was assigned to her by the chief of the village and provides her with significant revenues. Mrs. N. was embezzled of her monthly cash payments by the person she had asked to stand in for her while she was away. As a consequence, she is requesting a loan of 150 000 francs to settle her overdue bill. This loan will allow her to resume the sale of water to families in the neighbourhood. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Joanne Archambault, Kiva

She used her loan to buy the ingredients she needs to prepare these foods, as well as several tools, like meat grinders and dough mixers.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":491834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","use":"Buy mixers, meat grinders and ingredients like meat, vegetables and spices ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Coronel Oviedo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.416667 -56.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-02-26T19:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cynthia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":10625676,"loan_amount":2275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":664105},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":664101}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.18},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.18},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.18},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.18},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":995.31,"local_amount":4648735,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4672993.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123915683,"comment":null},{"amount":710.94,"local_amount":3320525,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3337852.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128951326,"comment":null},{"amount":426.56,"local_amount":1992315,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2002711.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136680004,"comment":null},{"amount":142.19,"local_amount":664101,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:51Z","rounded_local_amount":667566.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144714399,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-28T03:02:51Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":177839,"name":"Mamadou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Mamadou G. est un jeune couturier de 31 ans qui habite \u00e0 Bambilor.

Once a rectangle measuring 70x150 centimeters is attained, the member weaves the edges with a weaving hook making a special, 12 centimeter, design.  Finally, long fringe, that had previously been knotted and twisted to encircle the blanket, is added.

Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in the slums surrounding Santiago, a city famous for its production of tobacco and beef, where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. As a single mother with her two children, she makes her home here in a simple structure.\r\n\r\nCarmelina is excited to be taking her first loan with Esperanza and having the opportunity to expand her business with low interest capital. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business running a beauty salon by purchasing a power generator. As you can imagine, this will be a large improvement in her beauty salon which is in an area where blackouts are common. She will use the profits to invest in her children's future by enrolling them in a private high school. Her long term goal is to save enough money to own her own home.

Through her hard work, Guadalupe hopes to buy land so that she can leave an inheritance for her children.  She will use the money from her loan to buy soybeans in bulk so that she can package them in large quantities.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Viviana serves as the Secretary.  She is a new client who has been in a common law marriage for three years and has a daughter.  Viviana has been selling cosmetics for the past two years.  She has been living in a rented house for two years.  With the help of her husband, she hopes to soon buy land so that they can build a house and establish a stable family.   She will use the money from her loan to buy beauty products that are on sale that she can later sell at regular prices.\r\n<p>\r\nAll of the members are responsible and dynamic people.  Most of them support their families alone.  This loan will be used to buy merchandise as well as increase their operating capital.  They are grateful to Kiva and Emprender for trusting them by providing this loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

The couple lives together with their children.  Tossivi and her husband share the family expenses.  Tossivi\u2019s business is selling wood charcoal, both retail and wholesale.  She also sells vegetable and palm oil.  Tossivi sells her products out of her own home, but she does her buying at Bassila and Pahou, two large markets in Benin.  Though she never attended school, Tossivi has been managing her business for about 13 years.  Tossivi is a great client of ALID\u00e9, because she has received seven loans which have all been paid back.

Thanks to their joint effort, they have managed to build their own home.\r\n\r\nShe raises and sells dressed chickens on order and cattle.  She has been in this line of work for two years.

Married to Joseph Agbassa, a land surveyor, Kai is the mother of five children and has three additional children in her care. All of the children are in school. Kai lives together with her husband and children. The couple provide for the family together. To meet her needs, Kai sells tisane leaves (a plant used in traditional medicine) and pottery at her house. It is in Glagou\u00e9 and at Dantokpa, the international market in Benin, that Kai gets her supplies. Kai has run this business for 9 years. Kai has already obtained one loan through ALID\u00c9 (one of Kiva's field partners), which she repaid properly. Kai is no longer able to satisfy all the demands of her clientele, thanks to the limited financial means she has.

She is married and lives with her husband and their minor child in the small town Chepito Alto of the district of M\u00f3rrope, located 45 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe has been selling fuel from her house for more than a year. She tells us that the idea for her business was born from the lack of water to irrigate the plantings in the area. The farmers have made wells and they irrigate their crops with them. In order to do this, they have to use motors, which need gasoline to work.  \r\n\r\nThis business has brought her additional income which are a big help for the family's support. Her husband, like most of the men in the area, works as an agricultural laborer and what he makes is not enough to support the family economy. \r\n\r\nMaria Angelita wishes to grow her business with the purchase of more fuel and oil, with which she can continue to attend to the demand for her product. Due to this she is asking Edpyme Alternativa for the first time for a loan of 1000 nuevos soles. She plans on using it to acheive her goal.   \r\n\r\nShe is a young, hardworking mother and very dedicated to her family.

Nicole lives together with her children and husband. The couple provide for the family together. Nicole ended her studies in primary school. To contribute to meeting the family's expenses, Nicole sells food (red maize paste and 'piron' -  a paste made from manioc flour) in her district. Nicole gets her supplies at Dantokpa, the international market in Benin. Nicole has run this business for 8 years, and has already obtained one loan through ALID\u00c9 (one of Kiva's field partners), which she repaid properly. Nicole is seeking a second loan with ALID\u00c9 to increase her production and better satisfy her clientele.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

They arranged a meeting to find out about the program, and accepted because it gave them the opportunity to increase their working capital and receive training sessions that would allow them to more fully develop themselves as people. They are very hard-working women, and this is a great opportunity for them, since they have never before received any kind of credit.  The committee is called Fel\u00edz (\u201cHappy\u201d), and they are currently in their fifth loan cycle. The group is made up of 18 hard-working, sacrificing women who strive each day to afford a better quality of life to themselves and their families.  All the group members are very active women, and have invested their loans in their respective activities. One of these women is Mrs. Antonia V., who sells fruits and vegetables in the Paraguar\u00ed market. She has a stand where she displays her fresh produce, which she buys from other group members. Some of the fruits she sells are oranges, bananas, pineapples and watermelon; some of the vegetables she sells are onions, tomatoes, carrots and hot peppers.  Her sales are very good, and help her pay her household expenses.

She has a small grocery store where she sells basic needs items.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for funding to stock her store.  Her husband, Efrain, is an urban taxi driver.  Thanks to their combined efforts, they have owned their own house and vehicle for a year now.\r\n\r\nThe couple had a recent setback that almost caused them to lose all their belongings.  What happend was:  the wife lent herself some money to pay for her husband's trip abroad where work conditions would provide higher income.  However, once abroad he was discovered to be undocumented and he was deported to Bolivia; he had just recently left.  After this, he left the country again and stayed out working for over a year.  He was able to earn enough money to build the house and buy a vehicle, which he currently uses to work and help with household expenses.  They comment that the experience they went through taught them to value family unity which is the fundamental pillar needed to overcome any adversity.\r\n\r\nThey are very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the trust placed in them by granting the loan.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":492051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy stock items for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eulalia \t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":3400,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.43},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":381.57},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":413.92},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.47},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":448.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":467.49},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.11},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.95},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.87},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.02},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.89,"local_amount":366.43,"processed_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":378.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128936220,"comment":null},{"amount":56.11,"local_amount":381.57,"processed_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":393.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136663761,"comment":null},{"amount":58.95,"local_amount":400.88,"processed_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":413.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144696567,"comment":null},{"amount":60.87,"local_amount":413.92,"processed_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":427.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151879620,"comment":null},{"amount":63.75,"local_amount":433.47,"processed_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":447.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159619687,"comment":null},{"amount":66.02,"local_amount":448.94,"processed_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":463.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166834143,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":467.49,"processed_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":482.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172100713,"comment":null},{"amount":71.66,"local_amount":487.3,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":503.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177393552,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-20T00:06:19Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:38:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":177999,"name":"Santos","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Santos is a commercial truck driver based out of the Port of Oakland.

The group is known in its neighborhood as being very loyal and responsible with each other.\r\n\r\nEach member has her own independent business that she works hard with to get ahead.\r\n\r\nMrs. Juana P. is one of the committee members and she sells cosmetics.  With the first loan that she received she could begin her business, and now wants to improve it since every day she has more customers.  Because of this she would like to build a room to show her products.  She has been selling house to house with her customers and also selling in her home.  In this way she has greatly increased her business.\r\n\r\nSo, each member does a different job with a lot of sacrifice, and has been able to help her family.\r\n\r\nThe work of each member is listed below: \r\n1.

With the loan she receives from the Foundation she will buy corn seed and seedlings of lettuce, carrots, onions, etc, and she will use part to buy books for her youngest son who is still in school. <p>\r\nHer greatest dream is that her children will stand out in their professional and family lives. <p>\r\nJust like Zara, Maura has been working with the community bank for one loan cycle. She is a very cheerful member and she told us that her sister-in-law invited her to be part of this great group and access the benefits offered by the Foundation. Our friend is 32 years old, an affectionate wife, and the mother of kids of 10 and 8 years old. She carries out various economic activities including selling cosmetics from the Yanbal catalog (which she has been doing for 3 years), also washing clothes for her neighbors (for two years), and, of course, caring for her home and her children. <p>\r\nMaura tells us that her husband moved abroad six years ago in search of better opportunities for him and his family, but that it hasn't been easy. They still do not have their own home and they live in her sister's house. With the money from her loan she will buy creams, perfumes, lipsticks, and makeup, along with other products from the Yanbal line. Her goal is to continue growing her business. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":490652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy corn seed, seedlings of lettuce, onion, and carrot; also creams, makeup, perfumes, eyeshadow, lipsticks, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-20T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maura Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zara Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Fanni Eustela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1705,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":213.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":282.53,"local_amount":279.25,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":282.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910760,"comment":null},{"amount":364.36,"local_amount":360.14,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:20Z","rounded_local_amount":364.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946445,"comment":null},{"amount":215.63,"local_amount":213.13,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":215.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946446,"comment":null},{"amount":862.48,"local_amount":852.48,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":862.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708893,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T05:49:26Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":178013,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Daniel  es soltero, tiene 25 a\u00f1os,  vive con su madre.\nHab\u00eda montado el vivero, gracias a un peque\u00f1o capital que hab\u00eda  ahorrado con su madre durante varios a\u00f1os. \nQuiere comprar  plantas al por mayor, pues, as\u00ed consigue m\u00e1s barato y tiene un margen importante de ganancia.\nEl  se\u00f1or Daniel  es una persona muy activa tiene un esp\u00edritu emprendedor, y cuenta con un car\u00e1cter muy agradable por lo que muchas personas siempre est\u00e1n a su alrededor.

A., 27, lives in El Bosque, a neighborhood in southeastern Barranquilla.  He owns a store there called La Monumental del Bosque where he sells all kinds of everyday products: rice, sugar, coffee, bread, salt, cheese, milk, soft drinks and bottled juices.  He also sells cell phone services.  It's a family business, one that Engelberth's family has operated for many years.  His parents opened the store before he was born, 27 years ago, and he has been working there since he was seven.\r\n\r\nEngelberth has borrowed from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo twice before and the loans have allowed him to increase the range of goods he sells and, in turn, increased his income and helped him to improve his quality of life.  He is now applying for a $1,200,000 loan that he will use to buy wholesale supplies of meat and cheese in Magdalena.  The products are much in demand in his area and the new supplies will help him satisfy the demand.  He can get better prices in Magdalena so he will be able to sell the goods for less than nearby supermarkets, his biggest competitors.  \r\n\r\nFor the future, he hopes to proviD. his 3 year old son with an excellent education.  His goal for himself is to increase his business so that he can become a supplier of products to other businesses like his.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

She has always had a business, through which she alone educated her five children.  Initially she was a cabinet-maker, then after a productive time, she gave this business to her son and decided to sell paper and miscellaneous supplies, which would be profitable and less demanding.  She arrived with her small children in the Barlovento neighborhood in the city of Barranquilla.  She lived in a house of lath and plaster.  With her discipline in managing her business income, she has provided a home for her 5 children.  This is her second loan through the  Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, the first having been repaid punctually.  That loan allowed her to supply her business, and it has become more productive.  Currently she requires financing in the amount of $675 to purchase office supplies such as cards, pens, colored pens, pencils, decorations, hooks, and other accessories in order to diversify her inventory.  Her goal is to open a branch in the Los Olivos neighborhood, since she has a house there that could be staffed by her daughter, so that she too could work independently, since currently she is her mother's best helper.  Elizabeth has had many setbacks, the most important of which was the separation from her husband with whom she started the cabinet-making business.  Then came the responsibility of raising her children in another city, and getting ahead with the family business in order to support her family and her employees.  Eventually her shop employed 13 persons.  Now this shop is manned by her last son who has finished his Fine Arts education.  Through her work she educated her 5 children, all of whom took their education as far as they wished, and 2 of whom became professionals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford,

This has been her means of working to help out her children.  She lives in the Memorial Sandino neighborhood where she has many clients.  She purchases the pork, butchers it, then sells it as meat, as well as selling fries, chicharron, tamales, sausage, and lard, getting more out of a pig than she would by selling it whole.  Some months ago she had a lot of difficulty due to the swine flu, because sale of pork products was prohibited.  This was a critical time for her, since this is what she knows how to do.

He has a son who lives and studies in the city.\r\n<p>\r\nLiberato has been farming almost all of his life.  He currently grows potatoes and peas, and sells his harvest at the local markets near where he lives.  Since getting married twenty years ago, he has been selling groceries from a small store in his home and has done very well because he does not face any competition.  A few months ago, he opened a call center next to his store that is equipped with Internet kiosks.  This has also turned out to be good investment because Liberato lives in a remote area where no such establishments exist.

She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Ianuari has 4 years of experience in this business.  Ianuari needs a loan of WST $1300 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business to improve\/expand the business.  Ianuari is a hard working client which she want to continue her business\n\nIanuari joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ianuari's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Ianuari A. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

From there she had the idea to make delicious dishes of rice with fish and rice with chicken.  Part of her routine is to arise very early, starting the task of preparing the rice at 2:00 am, so that later her spouse can go out selling it at a strategic spot at the exit from the city of Barranquilla on the way to the city of Santa Marta.  Bellamis joined the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation program three years ago and has received three loans.  Currently she is requesting a loan of $800, partly to enlarge her tiny kitchen that hardly holds the industrial range that she bought with the last loan.  With the rest she will buy raw materials and supplies in large volume, in order to pay the best price for her supplies and increase her profits.  This will greatly help her 3 children, ages 17, 16 and 1, to get ahead.

She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Aiga has 2 years of experience in this business.  Aiga needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  Aiga T. is a strong, motivated client and wishes to have not only the ice cake busines but also a back up business to assist her with planting and elei as well.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Aiga joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Aiga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Aiga T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Her area is in the south of the city and is very commercial, with a mix of homes and shops that co-exist with commercial centres. Emilse is separated and has 3 daughters - 22, 20 and 19 years of age. She has been the proprietor of \u201cPeluquer\u00eda Miche\u201d for 14 years and is now seeking a loan to remodel her business, improve her work tools and purchase beauty products.\r\n\r\nEmilse began her business in the suburb of San Jos\u00e9 in 1996: after having studied beauty therapy and nursing she chose beauty therapy and opened her first hair-dressing salon with only one chair, one mirror and some basic tools. One year later she moved to Ciudadela 20 de Julio where she has lived and worked in the same house until today. The sector, owing to its commercialisation and commercial movement, has favoured the business and this is seen in its growth. \r\n\r\nEmilse has been connected with the Fundaci\u00f3n's program for 3 years and this is her third loan. She feels that the impact of the loans has been favourable and they have permitted her to progress as far in her business as she has with her life. Despite her success she wants to move forward and with this end soon she will move to the suburb of Las Cayenas, where she will also move her hair-dressing salon which she wants to fit out in a part of her house. Her 19 year old daughter is finishing her studies in cosmetology, and in the future, she wants to come together with 2 of her daughters to have a spa.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Maribel attends the store from Monday to Saturday all day, and is very satisfied because she generates good earnings which allow her to have a good quality of life.

P. is 25 and married with 5 children (ages 1 - 12).  She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Selina has 2 years of experience in this business.  Selina needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business to assist her family with the business activities such as a food stall for the school canteen.\n\nIn 2009, Selina joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Selina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Selina P. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She takes great care in looking after her animals until they are large enough to be sold to merchants at the local market.  What she enjoys about her work is that it is easy and the animals keep her entertained.  At the same time, it helps her support her daughters.  The money she has earned has allowed her to help her husband with the constant household expenses.  Preventiva also grows potatoes and corn, which she sells at the local markets.

SPBD's loans are Tautala's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Tautala H. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

The oldest child is married and lives separately from the rest of the immediate family.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the past year, Vilma has been selling clothing and all types of shoes.  She knows that she must utilize her persuasive skills to convince her regular customers (friends and neighbors) about which types of clothes and shoes fit best and keep them satisfied.  She earns a good income that allows her to help her husband with the household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nAt the same time, Vilma works as an elder care provider and is compensated well for this job.  She is very proud of what she has accomplished because she has worked hard all of her life.  In the future, she plans to open a store at a shopping center where she sells clothing and shoes.

She owns a business venture, selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community.  Mele has 1 year of experience in this business.  Mele needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nMele is a client who wishes to join the program to restart her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mele joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Mele's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Mele A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

R. is a very entrepreneurial woman. She is 40 years old, lives in the Villa del Carmen de Soledad neighborhood, and has 2 daughters, ages 11 and 2. She holds several jobs to improve her life, mostly tailoring and retail sales. She has been a client of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for 3 years and this is her third loan, which will be invested in the purchase of merchandise, specifically school supplies, beauty products, fabrics and supplies for tailoring.\r\n\r\nShe taught herself how to sew and started her business 10 years ago, making bedspreads, sweatshirts, and custom clothing for her friends. As she gained experience, she earned more income that she used to buy a multifunctional printer\/copier that allowed her to offer photocopy services to her neighbors, and a display case to sell beauty products and herbal supplements. Rosa is also a connoisseur of food: she makes fried foods such as deditos (cheese roll), empanadas, and french fries in the evenings and hallacas (meat and vegetables wrapped in cornmeal and banana leaves) on the weekends. She prepares these foods with the help of her mother and her sister-in-law. She says her micro-loans have helped her develop her business because she never had access to financial resources before working with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.\r\n \r\nSince her divorce 2 years ago, Rosa has had to face many challenges alone while caring for her family. Her goal is to buy her own house for her and her daughters. She also wants to open a restaurant offering Afro-Caribbean food, which consists of a lot of fish dishes. With this end in mind, she is currently taking a culinary course at SENA de T\u00e9cnico, a technical college. The schedule, 10:00 at night until 5:00 in the morning, is difficult, but she is motivated by her dream of starting a restaurant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva

For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling bamboo handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Levene has 2 years of experience in this business.  Levene needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Levene joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Levene's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Levene E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

Gladys is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cJes\u00fas en ti Confio\u201d (Jesus in You I Trust).  She has a sixth graD. education.\r\n<p>\r\nGladys sells food products such as rice, sugar, noodles, oil, dried vegetables, potatoes, and other items from her vending post at the market near her home.  In the afternoons and evenings, she manages a restaurant where she sells grilled chicken, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anticuchos\" target=\"_blank\" >anticuchos<\/a> (skewered meats), <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Salchipapas\" target=\"_blank\" >salchipapas<\/a> (sausages and fried potatoes), sodas, beer, and other dishes. \r\n<p>\r\nWith her first loan of 300 PEN, she bought food in bulk such as rice, sugar, dried vegetables, oil, etc.  Now she needs another loan in the amount of 1000 PEN in order to buy more food products such as rice, dried vegetables, milk, sugar, noodles, sodas, and beer in bulk.  Her dreams are to increase her sales and generate better earnings so that she can cover her personal expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nGladys currently has life insurance acquired through Manuela Ramos because she is concerned about any misfortune that might happen.  The insurance provides peace of mind because her funeral and burial expenses will be covered so that her family does not have to be concerned or inconvenienced.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":488833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase rice, dried vegetables, milk, sugar, noodles, sodas, and beer ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.115994 -79.02998","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys Marleny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":167.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987642,"comment":null},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":167.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713678,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":167.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746725,"comment":null},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":167.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929851,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":167.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159669019,"comment":null},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":167.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166882728,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-03-02T15:06:49Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:36:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":178121,"name":"Koreti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Koreti P. is 26 and married with 2 children (ages 1-month and 3yrs).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Koreti has 5 years of experience in this business.  Koreti needs a loan of WST $800 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at: http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Koreti joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Koreti's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Koreti P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Taei joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Taei's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Taei F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She owns a business venture, selling fabric handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Musuva has 2 years of experience in this business.  Musuva needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Musuva joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Musuva's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Musuva I. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

SPBD's loans are Naomi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Naomi L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is married and has two beautiful children who are in high school.  Her husband is a cabinetmaker.  \r\n\r\nOn her life\u2019s path she has worked at various jobs to be able to help her family with the expenses.  She has worked as a domestic employee, which is very tiring work for poor pay.  With part of her savings and with money that her husband gave her, she was able to buy clothes and cosmetics to start selling in order to earn her own money.  Also, on the week ends she sells food, \u201cbaho\u201d (a traditional Nicaraguan stew), \"vigoron\" (a typical Nicaraguan dish of cabbage and yucca), and soup.  She takes this opportunity to improve her earnings and be able to improve her house.\r\n\r\nWith this request she hopes to finish it.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Sauiluma has 4 years of experience in this business.  Sauiluma needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sauiluma joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sauiluma's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sauiluma F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She has been separated for some time from the father of her 3 children, who live with her in her own house, but which is only half constructed.  For the past 15 years, she has dedicated herself to the weaving of jackets, a business in which has grown little by little, especially with designs typical for tourists, thanks to the recent demand in these types of pieces of clothing.  As a result, Ana rented a stand in a busy area, a place very near the embarkation for trips leaving the country.  Since then, she has improved considerably her situation.  She has been asked to add embroidery to her jackets and she doesn't hesitate to do so, which means she is making a lot more than before.  She does her work with ease, since she has always had skillful hands at weaving since she was a little girl.  However, she never imagined that this art form, inherited from her mother would be the basis of her income.  This is her 20th loan with MFP and she promises to continue to act responsibly in her payments because it is important for her to be able to depend on future credits that will be a fundamental tool in her business' progress.  She plans to invest the money that is applying for in the purchase of wool, threads of various thicknesses, and embroidery templates.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":492230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","use":"Purchase of wool and other textile materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-21T18:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":444.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.42},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":510.04},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":535.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":553.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.7},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.95},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.64},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.52},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.4},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":166.18,"local_amount":474.8,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:28Z","rounded_local_amount":477.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993268,"comment":null},{"amount":199,"local_amount":568.56,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":571.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718051,"comment":null},{"amount":125.11,"local_amount":357.48,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":359.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751726,"comment":null},{"amount":178.52,"local_amount":510.04,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":512.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934188,"comment":null},{"amount":381.19,"local_amount":1089.12,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1094.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672967,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T20:40:17Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":178148,"name":"Angel Jonathan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El joven ANGEL JONATHAN M.

She has three children. She lives with her youngest daughter Gabriela who studies at the university. They live in their own house, which is located in a densely populated neighborhood in Lima.\r\n\r\nWith her characteristic sense of humor she has performed her daily work as a seamstress for eight years. She really likes her activity, because she can let her imagination run to sew great laces and finish off her dresses. In the beginning, she worked for someone else, but as the years passed she became independent and earned much more money in her own business. It was this income that allowed her to face up to her husband's terminal illness until the last days of his life.\r\n\r\nLater on she overcame these painful times, and now she plans to expand her business. She wants to rent a stall at her local market, as her greatest pleasure is sewing and, despite competition in her neighborhood, she has many customers who prefer dealing with her because of her timely work and good finishing.\r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's third loan with the microfinance institution Microfinanzas Prisma. She promises to continue working with the same responsibility as she has done so far, since this loan is very helpful for the growth of her business. She is going to use part of the requested money to buy more fabric to sew her dresses and part of the money to buy some finished dresses for rent and get some extra money.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":492233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"To buy fabric and dresses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-22T18:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.42},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.96},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":226.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.22},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.06},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":251.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.91},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":287.32},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":294.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.23},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.77},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.9},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.72},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.42},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.56},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72.25,"local_amount":206.42,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":207.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993269,"comment":null},{"amount":75.23,"local_amount":214.96,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":216.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718052,"comment":null},{"amount":79.33,"local_amount":226.66,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":227.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751727,"comment":null},{"amount":82.94,"local_amount":236.96,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:19Z","rounded_local_amount":238.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934189,"comment":null},{"amount":84.46,"local_amount":241.32,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":242.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672968,"comment":null},{"amount":87.9,"local_amount":251.13,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":252.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886753,"comment":null},{"amount":92.72,"local_amount":264.91,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":266.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153827,"comment":null},{"amount":96.43,"local_amount":275.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":276.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449233,"comment":null},{"amount":100.55,"local_amount":287.32,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":288.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588907,"comment":null},{"amount":103.19,"local_amount":294.82,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":296.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724583,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-22T21:38:14Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":178150,"name":"Leonardo Fabian","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leonardo Fabi\u00e1n Guaman C. tiene 22 a\u00f1os, vive en union libre, y  tiene un hijo.

Faaifo needs a loan of WST $2250 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\n\nFaaifo joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faaifo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Faaifo U. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                         1.7 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Her main desire is to be able to provide for a quality education for her children, which will guarantee them a better future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":492177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Buy poultry for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Cruz del M\u00e9dano - M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-02-21T18:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.93},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.91},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":81.54},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84.54},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.26},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":89.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.61},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.54},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":77.93,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":78.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934618,"comment":null},{"amount":27.61,"local_amount":78.91,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":79.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662224,"comment":null},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":81.54,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":81.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694927,"comment":null},{"amount":29.59,"local_amount":84.54,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":84.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877973,"comment":null},{"amount":30.54,"local_amount":87.26,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:48Z","rounded_local_amount":87.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618004,"comment":null},{"amount":31.44,"local_amount":89.82,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":90.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832403,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T20:44:50Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":178157,"name":"Faapepele","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faapepele L. is 25 and married with 2 children.  She owns a business venture, selling fabric handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Faapepele has 2 years of experience in this business.  Faapepele needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faapepele joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faapepele's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faapepele L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She owns a business venture, raising pigs for sale.  Makerita  has many years of experience in this business.  Makerita  needs a loan of WST $1000 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Makerita  joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Makerita 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Makerita  P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

que es del gusto de las clientas y a la comunidad de donde son originarias las integrantes del grupo. Est\u00e1 ubicado en la comunidad de Loma Alta Villa del Carb\u00f3n, en el Estado de M\u00e9xico.  El grupo est\u00e1 conformado por  14 integrantes y es la primera vez que solicita un cr\u00e9dito a CrediCom\u00fan. Sin embargo, la mayor\u00eda de ellas ya ha tenido experiencia crediticia con otras instituciones.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Marcelina A. R., conocida por todos como \u201cDo\u00f1a Marce\u201d es integrante del grupo. Tiene 49 a\u00f1os y no tiene estudios, es comerciante y ama de casa. Tuvo 8 hijos, 4 mujeres (1 ya falleci\u00f3)  y 4 varones. Ella se dedica a la venta de comida desde hace 23 a\u00f1os. Despu\u00e9s de haber trabajado en un restaurant en el D.F. y motivada por la experiencia y los deseos de superaci\u00f3n, fue como decidi\u00f3 iniciar su negocio. No obstante, en aquellos a\u00f1os ella no contaba con la infraestructura suficiente, por lo que empez\u00f3 cocinando en su propia casa y buscando en las calles a sus posibles clientes,\n\nPlatica Do\u00f1a Marce que su casa tambi\u00e9n era muy peque\u00f1a, no hab\u00eda dinero para hacer otro cuartito e independizar el negocio. Poco a poco, la gente la empez\u00f3 a buscar hasta que consigui\u00f3 pedidos de comidas y desayunos para maestros de las escuelas de su localidad, para  m\u00e9dicos del centro de salud, e incluso para gente que tiene sus negocios en los alrededores y para  los visitantes del lugar tambi\u00e9n, pues como sus vecinos ya la conoc\u00edan siempre la recomendaban y as\u00ed es como ha crecido su negocio. Actualmente ella ya amplio su casita y ah\u00ed mismo sigue atendiendo el negocio pero ya con un espacio mejor acondicionado.\n \nSolicita el pr\u00e9stamo para \u201ccomprar una estufa\u201d, porque la que tiene ya no le es suficiente para elaborar diariamente sus pedidos de comida y tambi\u00e9n para \u201ccomprar un exprimidor\u201d que le permita hacer m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidamente los jugos que vende. Sus clientes disfrutan de su buena saz\u00f3n y su carisma. La siguen tambi\u00e9n porque les ofrece buenos precios, pues dice Do\u00f1a Marce \u201cTodos estamos amolados y nos tenemos que ayudar\u201d. Al momento de solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo se siente Ilusionada porque desea que su negocio siga creciendo y que as\u00ed como le ha permitido mejorar su casa y apoyar a su esposo con los gastos cuando \u00e9l no tiene trabajo, ahora realice su sue\u00f1o de comprar un terrenito que se ubica frente a su casa sobre la carretera, para construir en \u00e9l un local y establecer su cocina econ\u00f3mica.\n","en":"This group is called \u201cLas Populares de Loma\u201d in honor of the Mexican soap opera \"Dare to Dream\", which is enjoyed by many of our clients and the community in which these group members live.  The group originates from the community of Loma Alta Villa del Carb\u00f3n, in the State of Mexico.  There are 14 members and this is the first time they have applied for a loan from CrediCom\u00fan.  However, many of them have had previous experience with other credit institutions.\r\n\r\nSra. Marcelina A. R., known to everyone as \u201cDo\u00f1a Marce\u201d, is a member of the group.  She is 49 years old and the mother of eight children, four daughters (one is deceased) and four sons.  Despite not having an education, she has managed to become both a businesswoman and a homemaker.  Do\u00f1a Marce has been selling food for 23 years.  She previously worked at a restaurant in Mexico City.  Motivated by this experience and her desire to succeed, she decided to start her own business.  During that time, however, she had inadequate facilities, so she started cooking at home and then combed the streets in search of potential customers.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Marce\u2019s home was also very small, but she did not have enough money to build a separate room for her business.  Over time different people began approaching her to order breakfast and lunch, such as school teachers, doctors from the local clinic, business owners who worked in the surrounding area, and even visitors to the city.  Her neighbors have always known her and knew that her business would grow, so they recommended her to other people.  She has expanded her house and currently runs her business out of a space that is well-equipped.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Marce is requesting a loan to buy a stove because the one she has now is insufficient for preparing her daily food orders.  She also wants to buy a juicer so that she can prepare juices faster.  Her customers enjoy being around her and appreciate her charismatic personality.  She also has a loyal following because her dishes are offered at low prices.  \u201cEveryone works so hard, so we have to help them,\u201d says Do\u00f1a Marce.  Upon requesting this loan, she was optimistic about growing her business since this will allow her to make improvements to her home and support her husband with the household expenses whenever he is not able to find work.  Do\u00f1a Marce now dreams of buying a piece of land along the highway in front of her house where she can build a shop and establish her food business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

M. is 26 and married with 2 children (ages 1 and 3).  She owns a business venture, selling food products in the local community.  Vitolio has many years of experience in this business.  Vitolio needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Vitolio joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Vitolio's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vitolio M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

L. is 53 and married with 6 children (ages 10 - 24).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Epenesa has many years of experience in this business.  Epenesa needs a loan of WST $1000 to rent land to raise additional crops.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Epenesa joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Epenesa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Epenesa L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

M. is 28 and married with 3 children (ages 2 - 6).  She owns a business venture, selling lavalavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women).  Lagimaina has many years of experience in this business.  Lagimaina needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of sewing lavalavas and puletesis, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SewingLavalavasAndPuletesi#\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lagimaina joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Lagimaina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lagimaina M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

 M. is 64 and married with 10 children (ages 19 - 35).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Sina  has many years of experience in this business.  Sina  needs a loan of WST $2250 to rent land to raise additional crops.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sina  joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sina 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sina  M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Laine has many years of experience in this business.  Laine needs a loan of WST $1750 to rent land to raise additional crops.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2007, Laine joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Laine's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Laine H. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                         1.4 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.4 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling clay handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Sareta has many years of experience in this business.  Sareta needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sareta joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sareta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sareta S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

F. is 35 and married with 3 children (ages 1 - 5).  She owns a business venture, running bingo games.  Luaupu has 3 years of experience in this business.  Luaupu needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase game prizes.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of bingo in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/Bingo#\r\n\r\nLuaupu joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Luaupu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Luaupu F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 35 and married with 5 children (ages 4 - 15).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Sesilia has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sesilia needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sesilia joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sesilia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sesilia T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Saitia has 3 years of experience in this business.  Saitia needs a loan of WST $2250 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Saitia joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Saitia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Saitia T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 35 and married with 5 children (ages 2 - 15).  She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Faleseu has 3 years of experience in this business.  Faleseu needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faleseu joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faleseu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faleseu T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

M. is 37 and married with 5 children (ages 2 - 14).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Ufiufi has 3 years of experience in this business.  Ufiufi needs a loan of WST $2250 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ufiufi joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Ufiufi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ufiufi M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

T. is 58 and married with 4 children (ages 12 - 29).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Faasaveve has 3 years of experience in this business.  Faasaveve needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at: http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Faasaveve joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faasaveve's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faasaveve T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nCelestina is 52 years old, married and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, Celestina sells a variety of products such as canned goods, sugar, salt, noodles, vinegar, candies, and other daily use products, to the local community. Celestina has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 20000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Celestina joined GDMPC to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Celestina successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from GDMPC. Celestina is requesting her third loan from GDMPC, for 8000 PHP, which she will use to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n<p>\r\nShe plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n<em>\r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

L. is 28 and married with 5 children (ages 5 - 11).  She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Maliemailatoelau has many years of experience in this business.  Maliemailatoelau needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Maliemailatoelau joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Maliemailatoelau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Maliemailatoelau L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

featured entrepreneur is the mother of three children with a passion for bamboo furniture making. She is Mrs. Mildred P. as shown in the picture together with her one of her daughters. She is 26 years old, married to Ramil P. and blessed with three children. Two of her children are of school age and one is still a minor dependent. Her husband is the one who makes the arts and some carpentry works. She assists in the preparation of the finished bamboo poles used to make the furniture. They\u2019ve been in this kind of business for 10 years and at this time, they earn an average net income of not less than P5,000 a month. Their business is still existing and progressing. She joined PAGLAUM MPC a year ago.  She was given the privilege of borrowing P14,000 as her third loan to add to their capital for purchasing raw materials for their bamboo furniture making business. The future income from this business will be used for their daily needs, loan repayments and savings for her children\u2019s future. The couple plans to have an outlet for display in the future. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

T. is 50 and married with 6 children (ages 15 - 26).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Lopepe has many years of experience in this business.  Lopepe needs a loan of WST $2250 to rent land to raise additional crops.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lopepe joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lopepe's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lopepe T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

A. is 50 and married with 3 children (ages 16 - 24).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Lagi has many years of experience in this business.  Lagi needs a loan of WST $1750 to rent land to raise additional crops.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lagi joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Lagi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lagi A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

F. is 28 and married with 3 children (ages 1 - 8).  She is starting a business venture, catching & selling farm-raised fish .  Fonotele needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional fish to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fonotele joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fonotele's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fonotele F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Anasii has 1 year of experience in this business.  Anasii needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Anasii joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Anasii's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Anasii S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling fine mats used as keepsakes .  Marata has 3 years of experience in this business.  Marata needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy laufala (plant fibres) and decorations for mats.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marata joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Marata's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Marata L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

skills in manicure and pedicure, our featured entrepreneur in this story is Mrs. Primitiva F.. She is 44 years of age, married, and a resident of Maloro, Tangub City. Together with her in the picture is her customer. Her husband is an employee of the Local Government of Tangub City. She is blessed with four children who are all adults and teenagers. With this condition, she felt financial hardships, especially in raising their children and in sending them to school. She decided to engage in manicure and pedicure services and a little hog raising activity. This time she is earning an average net income of not less than 3,000PHP from her services rendered to her loyal customers and friends. She joined PAGLAUM MPC three years ago. She was given the privilege of taking a loan of 14,900 PHP. Her recent loan in the same amount will be used to finance feed for her hog raising activity and for purchasing additional pedicure and manicure sets for her business activity. The future income from this business will be used for daily basic needs, savings and loan repayments. She is hoping that someday she can build another building for her hog raising business.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
