Mar\u00eda Jesus says she needs this loan to invest in her business because people are requesting products she does not have.  She says that is was easier for her to buy clothes in the month of September because afterwards it will get difficult to find a variety  of colors and styles because many people are buying what they can to sell for the Christmas season.  Mar\u00eda Jesus needs a loan now while prices are still affordable.  If she waits, then the products she wants will either not be available or be offered at a much higher price.  For this reason, she hopes that FAPE will assist her so that she can expand her business and generate income during this good season.  She also needs to continue supporting her children with their studies.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350.22,"image":{"id":908428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy traditional clothing to sell.

For 38 years he alternated his work and the hospital\u2019s business. 20 years ago he partnered with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo through a communal bank. In his business, Julio provides hypodermic syringes, takes blood pressure, and offers respiratory therapies, and he is now helped by his wife who is also a nurse. For four years he\u2019s been running his business out of a shop in his home, and he is completely independent which makes him very happy. \r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is his second after having finished his communal bank loan through FMSD. He is thankful to this organization for having important equipment to offer respiratory therapy. His goal is to continue improving his business as this will help him provide for the well-being of his family. With his Kiva loan, he will buy medicine in cash and in greater quantity in order to save money and get better prices, making his investment very successful.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":331.57,"image":{"id":908548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","use":"to buy medicines in cash and in greater quantity to save money and get better prices.

Lleva dedicandose a ambas actividades desde hace siete a\u00f1os, y hasta el momento lo ha hecho solo. \u00c9l se siente a gusto con lo que hace, ya que le permite tener un ingreso econ\u00f3mico y gracias a ello puede solventar los gastos de su hogar. Tiene planes de ampliar su negocio de digitaci\u00f3n, pues desea ofrecer el servicio de escanear fotos, ya que por la zona por donde vive es el \u00fanico que brinda \u00e9ste servicio. Este ser\u00e1 su segundo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y por tanto se siente muy bien con su grupo comunal, pues los considera como personas responsables y cumplidoras con el pago de sus cuotas. Con el monto solicitado, comprar\u00e1 un scanner nuevo y repuestos para su mototaxi.\n\n","en":"David, 33, is an enterprising and friendly young man. He lives with his wife and their small daughter, along with two sisters and three cousins, in their own home. The work that David does is typing documents into the computer. At the same time, he also offers transportation services on his moto-taxi, which he was able to buy with his savings. He gets up to work these jobs at seven in the morning, and at the moment he works alone. He is happy with what he is doing since it allows him to have an income and, thanks to that, he can cover the household costs. He has plans to expand his typing business as he\u2019d like to offer photo-scanning services since, in the area where he lives, he\u2019s the only business that offers that services. This will be his second loan with MFP, and he feels very happy with his communal bank as he considers the members to be responsible and compliant with the payment of their loans. He will buy a new scanner and pay for repairs to his moto-taxi with the loan he\u2019s asked for."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":240.35,"image":{"id":908556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","use":"to buy a scanner and to pay for repairs to his moto-taxi.

is a 33-year-old lady married to Saul, a 35-year-old man. Maria and Saul adopted a little girl named Marsella from her relatives. Marsella, who is 10, is studying at the 3rd grade in Elementary School. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet their family needs, Maria\u2019s husband runs an electronics (e.g. television, radio, tape recorder etc) repair shop business. As the income generated from the business is unstable, Maria took the initiative to sell gasoline in front of her house to support her husband in meeting their family needs. She has been running the business for almost five years. \r\n\r\nMaria intends to add more gasoline for her business after she saw the opportunity to serve people who do not have time to stand in line at the gasoline station, particularly in the morning when they should go to work and school. It would allow her business product to be sold out quickly. \r\n\r\nThis situation led her to seek a loan of IDR 3,000,000 from TLM. She plans to purchase more gasoline to sell. She hopes that TLM will assist her in improving her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

The income generated from the business is unstable and often insufficient to fully cover their living as well as the educational fees of his children.  \r\n\r\nIn order to earn more income, Messak is thinking of initiating other businesses. He plans to rent a plot of land for five years and purchase four sacks of corn seed and fertilizer. He would like to cultivate corn at the farm and to sell it after the harvest. Therefore, he is requesting a loan of IDR 7,500,000 from TLM. He hopes that TLM will approve his loan application

She runs a general merchandise store in Goderich, in the western area of Freetown, Sierra Leone. She has two additional dependents that live with her because they are relatives from the village.  \r\n\r\nIn 2004, Frances established her general merchandise business. She began this business because she needed a permanent source of income to support her family. She sells general merchandise such as Maggie, soft drinks, tomato past, butter, seasoning (stew seasoning), and onions at her store.

Also as she knows how to bake, she also sells desserts at special times commisioned by neighbours and people they know and recommend.

family and two sons, who are seven and five years old, in the the Oi-Tal village (north-eastern part of Kyrgyzstan).  In search of a source of income, Akylbek started his own business of breeding livestock, growing and reselling agricultural crops in 1996.  Akylbek has apple and pear trees on his plot of land and also devotes special attention to cultivating and growing a particular variety of potatoes that is in higher demand among the local residents.  His persistent and tireless labor in the business allows Akylbek to cover his family's and household expenses and also to plan his children's future.  In order to further increase his livestock quantity, Akylbek requested a loan in the sum of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy additional livestock headcount for fattening up.  He plans to use the planned profit for the purchase of fodder and hay for the winter, so that he can start reselling livestock in the spring."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":909266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Oi-Tal village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-04T04:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Akylbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":887.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":887.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T09:46:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":353548,"name":"Junie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Junie, 45 years old, is married, and they are blessed with five children.

daughter.  Djumabay was born in 1969 into a simple farmer's family.  His father had a small farm, and since childhood, Djumabay helped his father with caring for the livestock and dreamed of having his own farm in the future.  In 1988, after finishing school, Djumabay went to serve in the army.  Upon his return to his native village in 1990, he studied to become a driver of agricultural machinery and was hired at the local collective farm as a tractor\/combine driver.  After some time, Djumabay got married and, using his salary, gradually purchased young livestock and grew clover and cereals; thus, expanding his farm.  His daughter was born in 2002, and Djumabay was able to buy his own house for his family in 2003.  Currently, thanks to Djumabay's persistence, his farm contains 3 dairy cows and 22 heads of sheep.  In order to further develop his business, Djumabay requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for the purchase of bulls for fattening up.  In the future, Djumabay plans to increase livestock headcount and dreams of buying an off-road vehicle.

She also needs the loan to buy the necessary materials (containers, molds, rennet tablets, pieces of cloth, etc.) to make cheese, cream, cottage cheese, etc.\r\n\r\nThe goal of all this is to improve her customer service, since this way she will be able to keep her business productive for much longer and she will be able to continue fighting for her dream.

is 58 years old and married with 7 children aged 17-40 living in his own house in Hioma, Uganda. He has dependents and he is the only income earner in the family.\r\n\r\nFor two years he has been running a business of house renting and this has facilitated him in providing for his family.
