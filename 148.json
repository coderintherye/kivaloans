Thi Thuy has been a member of the TYM Fund since 2003. She frequently borrowed from the Fund to raise livestock in the earlier years. Currently, besides farming and raising livestock, she and her husband also work as hired workers to increase their income. With the monthly income of 3,000,000VND (about 200USD), not only can she repay the loan weekly and settle daily expenses, but she also can save a small amount to send her children to school and to purchase more household applications, thus improves the standard of living. This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to purchase 6 more pigs to breed, as well as to buy working tools for their job as hired workers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Thi Bich is 33 years old. She lives with her husband and 2 children in the town of Ninh Giang, province of Hai Duong. Presently their main source of income is from raising pigs and selling their meat. Every day her husband, Mr. Lan, would go purchase the pigs, and she would sell the meat at the local market. The work is hard but it brings them a stable income. With their income of 183 USD per month, it helps her family in repaying the loans. For this loan, she wishes to borrow 550 USD to buy additional 7 pigs to raise, and subsequently to sell their meat for the upcoming Tet Holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

She is currently living in Ninh Giang town, Hai Duong province. In the first round, Mrs. X. only asked for 1.000.000 VND to invest in poultries. However, after five years of membership, she now has her own small restaurant, which helps her earn 3.000.000 VND per month. As a result, her family\u2019s income has been improved a great deal, which has given her chances to invest in her children\u2019s education. In the next round of loan, Mrs. X. would like to borrow 9.000.000 VND ($550) to improve her restaurant to make more income for her family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Khoa Nguyen,

She is living with her husband and her two grown-up children in Ninh Giang town, Hai Duong province. Mrs. V. breeds poultries and plants fruits at home, and then sells them in the market. Her husband makes baskets at home and sells them for people in the town. After fiV. years of membership, her family\u2019s income has become much more stable. She has been able to renovate her house and buy motorbike to facilitate the family\u2019s business. In the next round of loan, Mrs. V. would like to borrow 6.000.000 VND ($375), part of which will be used to buy bamboo for her husband to make baskets; the rest will be invested in flowers to sell in

She currently has a small caf\u00e9 shop, selling beer and soft drinks in Dong Tam, Ninh Giang town, Hai Duong province. With the assistance of her husband, the caf\u00e9 has been going very well. In addition to selling beer in her caf\u00e9, she supplies it to other caf\u00e9 shops in her town, so her family\u2019s income has been relatively stable. With a monthly income of 4.000.000 VND, Mrs. C. is very on time in paying back her loans. In the next round of loan, Mrs. C. would like to borrow 20.000.000 VND ($1200) to stock more beer for her own caf\u00e9 as well as to sell it for other shops in her area, thereby earning more money to send her kids to good schools. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Khoa Nguyen, Kiva

The common local brew produced out of sorghum is Urwagwa, which is mostly drunk by local people in rural areas especially during wedding celebrations.<P>\r\n\r\n Besides the buying and selling of sorghum, Ernest also grows potatoes, which are commonly produced in the area where he lives because of the fertile volcanic soils in the region.

Their income is stable which allows them to provide a good education for their 3 children and have a good life.

She is 38 years old and mother of 4 children. She was abandoned by her husband who went to South Africa in 2004 to look for work, and never returned. Besides supporting her 4 children, she also supports and houses 3 nieces and nephews who lost their parent as victims to HIV. \r\n\r\nAida studied until the 5th grade, and then had to stop due to lack of finances. In 2005 she moved from the city of Maputo to Ponta, looking for better conditions. In Maputo she sold many products, but the family was too big. She decided to go to Ponta when she heard of the prices in her sister\u2019s company, who had lived there for many years. Aida now lives at her sister\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nAida is a vendor at the Ponta market. She has a small establishment where she sells mostly tomatoes and onions, purchased in South Africa, three times a week. Aida has been doing this kind of activity since she was a child, when she sold fried fish. Aida earns about 800,00 MT a day. \r\n\r\nThis is Aida\u2019s second loan, although she has never requested one through another institution. She discovered Hluvuku-Adsema through friends who were already clients. Her greatest dream is to acquire a piece of land on which to build her own home. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jill Haring, Kiva

Her monthly profit is around 4000.00MT, but she is unable to save money, as this income is used to grow her business and on her daughter's education.\r\n\r\nThis is Cacilda's first loan from Hluvuku and Kiva. She learned about Hluvuku through her neighbors who are customers already. Her plan for the future is to send both of her daughters to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Camila Vasconcelos, Kiva

For this, he contacted the lenders of AFSG to give him a 50,000AF individual loan for 27 months so he can buy some animals for his land.  \r\n\r\n<p>He says, \"By selling milk and yogurt, my income will increase and my problems will be solved.  Thanks a lot to the lenders of Kiva.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":224099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

She plans to invest this loan in rearing pigs and farming yellow yams and sweet yams.  She plans  to use her own savings to rent the land for farming her yams; she will use this loan to purchase all the necessary farming supplies for yams and to begin her pig business. <P>\r\n \r\nThis is Pamela's third loan from GHAPE.  She has never invested in pigs before; however, her husband has experience in this area and has passed his knowledge on to her.  She feels she can have large profits in this business because of her husband's support.  There is a high demand for yams, both sweet and yellow, in this region of Cameroon; she hopes her yams will fill some of this demand.  She also plans to sell some of the manure from her pigs to people in her community.  <P>\r\n \r\nWith the profits from this loan, Pamela hopes to build a proper pit latrine for her family.  She also hopes to save some money to purchase her own home; her family is currently living with her brother-in-law.  She lost her home due to her brother's debt.  She recently remarried after divorcing her first husband; many of those in her family have disowned her for this act.  She hopes this loan provides her with enough profit to begin to improve her family's living standards and recoup her losses.  <P>\r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":224101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"raising piglets and buying yellow yam and sweet yam seeds to grow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

She is 41 years old and attended school until the 8th grade.  She is married and the mother of 5 children between the ages of 22 and 29.  Three of her children are in college, and the others are working.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the 8th grade Ticana had to interrupt her studies due to the poor financial conditions of her parents.  She left Manhi\u00e7a for Marracuene with her husband who served as the Director of Agriculture in that district for 5 years.  Because she had a good level of schooling, Ticana was invited by the administrator to work as his secretary. Two years later her husband was transferred to work in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, so she abandoned her job.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived in Namaacha Ticana got a loan from her oldest sister and began her business of raising chickens with the help of her husband who is an expert agronomist; an activity that they continue today.  Besides being a great chicken farmer she is also owner of a food shack, but because the chicks require a lot of attention she does not have fixed hours of work.\r\n\r\nShe makes at a maximum 5X100 boxes of chickens at 35MT and resells each one for 85MT.  She raises them in phases to be able to sell alternatingly.  Her best product is a ready-prepared chicken that she sells from her stand.  She makes 4,000MT per month but is only able to save 500MT because she has to pay expenses for her children who are studying at the university, and her husband had problems in the service and lost his job.\r\n\r\nThis is Ticana's second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  The first loan of 15,000MT was used to purchase chickens and she was able to repay without any difficulties.  She is requesting this second loan of 12,000MT to reinforce her business.  She is confidant that she can pay off the loan before maturity so she can ask for another loan to construct a wall around her residence.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared

Strikers Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These people are Ahmed F., Mariama B., Osman F. and  Isatu K.. They named their group Young Strikers. This will be their third loan from SMT.  The previous loans have made tremendous impacts on the lives of these people. The last loan they received was for Le 800,000.00 each. Now, they are requesting a loan for Le 1,000,000.00 each to enable them to further strengthen their businesses.<P>\r\n\r\nAhmed (right) is the leader of this group. Ahmed is thirty-two years of age. He was born in Makeni City, in northern Sierra Leone. He is married to a businesswoman who sells rice. The two have two children, both of whom are in primary school. <P>\r\n\r\nAhmed has been in business for seven years now. Previously, he solely depended on running \u201cOkada\u201d (motor-bikes used for transportation) as his business. But with consistent loans through SMT, he has today diversified his business. Now, he owns a small kiosk where he sells both soft and hard drinks, cans of milk, sardines, bars of soap, and top-up cards (for all four mobile networks used here \u2013 Celtel, Tigo, Commiun and Africell). He also recharges mobile batteries for a fee of one thousand Leones. Both his wife and brother-in-law assist him in running the kiosk as he is still engaged in the Okada work. <P>\r\n   \r\nHe travels to Bamoi Junction (200 miles round trip) and Freetown (390 miles round trip) to buy the goods he sells. With a loan of Le 1,000,000.00 he will be able to buy four crates of soft drinks to add to the four crates he currently has in stock. He can also buy two crates of beer to add to the four he has today.

Today, they are requesting another loan to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n\r\nPa Hassan K.

This is 43-year-old Mwazani M M.. She is a married woman with two children between 16 and 18 years old. \r\n<p>\r\nMwazani has been running a tomato business since 2000. She buys tomatoes from farmers, brings them into town, and sells them at a higher price. Tomatoes are very common in Tanzania. Roasted tomatoes with onions can be mixed with cooked meat or fish or anything to make food more delicious. Mwazani\u2019s business is able to make a monthly profit of about 500 USD. Now Mwazani is requesting a loan of 1300 USD in order to purchase more tomatoes. She is  planning to open another business in the coming days. She thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":224137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase more tomatoes for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T02:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mwazani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1300000,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970744,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886961,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436221,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130493,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027290,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613313,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:45Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010396,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232707,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664523,"comment":null},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105254,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-15T19:48:08Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73806,"name":"Alfredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Alfredo vive en casa propia con su esposa e hijos en la calle Docweiler de la zona de Tacagua de la Ciudad de La Paz;

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":224169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To buy additional stocks of clothes, shoes, and bags.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T03:40:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970748,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886965,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436225,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130497,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027294,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613316,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010399,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232710,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664526,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105257,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-15T22:49:23Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73827,"name":"Luzmila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luzmila a sus 43 a\u00f1os de edad es viuda, vive con dos sus hijos que son estudiantes.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

La dificultad que tiene, es que a su pareja, no le gusta la actividad de la chacra, por ellos lo realiza sola. Este es su 7mo pr\u00e9stamo con MFP. Con el dinero que solicita contratar\u00e1 a peones para trabajar en sus tierras, cada uno cobra 15 soles por semana, calcula que ser\u00e1n 20 personas, el resto del dinero lo usar\u00e1 en la compra de herbecidas.","en":"Edith is 30 years old, lives with her partner who works as a chauffer transporting passengers, and they have three children.  She dedicates herself to caring for the children and to her studies from Monday to Friday.  On the weekends, she tends to her farmland where she cultivates potatoes that she plants for her own consumption since, as she tells us, what she buys at the market is not enough.  She likes farming because, since she was a young girl, she was raised in this environment.  Her parents were farmers and, for her, this activity has been the primary source of income.  The items she grows are indispensable to the daily menu.  The difficulty she has is that her partner does not enjoy farming, so she undertakes her activities on her own.  This is her 7th loan with MFP.  With the funds she is requesting, she will hire laborers to help work her land.  Each worker charges 15 soles per week, and she calculates she would need 20 people.  The remainder of the funds would be used to purchase herbicides.  <p>  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":224216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Hire laborers to help her work her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-11T13:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1313.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011276,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-11T17:27:40Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73861,"name":"Bertha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bertha is a member of the Poder (\"Power\") Communal Bank.

Joined together by family and neighborhood ties, the women decided to establish a partnership with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso five years ago. They are now on their tenth loan and all previous loans have been reimbursed without problems. The current loan will allow them to buy 20 bags of corn and peanuts, 400 kg of onions (fresh and dried), and a significant amount of seasonings. The grain retailers get their supplies on-site (especially on Tuesdays, market day) in Yanfolila from producers coming from surrounding villages. The seasoning sellers get their supplies each week in Sikasso from wholesalers in that area. These items are resold as retail, for cash, and sometimes on credit to customers who are mostly women from the town of Yanfolila. From their business activities, each member of the group hopes to make a profit of 50,000 FCFA per loan cycle, which will allow them to repay interest and meet certain household needs such as children's education, healthcare, and clothing. The members of Djiguiss\u00e8m\u00e8 would like in the future to open stores to stock and sell grains and seasonings in Yanfolila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Liana Bianchi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":224497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"Purchase of grains and seasonings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Yanfolila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.183333 -8.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aby    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kankoun ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aby ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":900000,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":583.33,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":301006.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974094,"comment":null},{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":150503.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889467,"comment":null},{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":150503.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440260,"comment":null},{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":150503.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135628,"comment":null},{"amount":291.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":150503.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033429,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-14T20:10:25Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73939,"name":"Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohamad lives in Keb Elias in the Bekaa valley.

They live in extended traditional families in the Dougoukoro neighborhood in the city of Yanfolila (one of the prefectures of the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nThey are linked by bonds of neighborhood and friendship. This groups specializes in selling Wax pagne (a highly prized cloth in Africa) and cereals. They've been partnering with the Soro Yiriwaso institution for two years now and are seeking their fourth solidarity loan (group loan). All previous loans have been repaid without problems. This loan will enable them to buy 40 pieces of Wax pagne from wholesalers in Bamako, as well as 100 kg of cereals from itinerant merchants coming from the surrounding villages.\r\nThe pagnes are then cut into \"trois pagnes\" (\"three pagnes\", i.e. the amount of fabric needed to make some woman outfits) and retailed for cash in the market and in the various neighborhoods in Yanfolila. The business results in a profit of XOF 1250 (ca US$ 2.40) per piece. The cereals are retailed to a mostly female clientele, for cash and on credit.\r\nThe members of the Benkadi group hope to make, each in their speciality, a monthly profit of XOF 50'000 (ca US$ 100) that thy intend to use to repay the loan and help their husbands in providing for the family.

She lives in a nuclear family with her husband and their children in the Nangosso district of Koutiala prefecture (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nBorn into a family of tradesmen, Madame Traor\u00e9 was initiated into revenue-generating activities at a very young age (her parents never wanted her to attend school). After a long apprenticeship at her grandmother\u2019s side, she decided to specialize in trading cereals ten years ago now. There is a very heavy demand from her clientele because rice constitutes one of Mali\u2019s basic foods. \r\n\r\nAnxious to better satisfy her clientele, in 2004 she decided to turn to the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso (Kiva Field Partner). With an experience of six solidarity loans (group loans) fully repaid, she is on her second individual loan; the first having been completed with no problem.\r\n\r\nWith this loan Madame Traor\u00e9 intends to buy a ton of rice at Niono (one of the largest rice-growing areas in the Republic of Mali) from the growers in the rice fields.She retails the rice for cash or credit at the big market in Koutiala to a clientele consisting of both men and women. This is a very lucrative operation, with a large profit margin, such that she expects to make a profit of 70,000 FCFA ($150) per cycle. This profit will be used to repay the loan interest and contribute to the family expenses. Soon Madame Traor\u00e9 hopes to open a small warehouse for the cereals in the Koutiala market. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":224536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"KOUTIALA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.383333 -5.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adizatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":31818.18},{"due_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":31818.18},{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":31818.18},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":31818.18},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":31818.18},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":31818.18},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":31818.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":31818.18},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":31818.18},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":31818.18},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":31818.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63.64,"local_amount":31818.18,"processed_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":32837.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974099,"comment":null},{"amount":63.64,"local_amount":31818.18,"processed_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":32837.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889473,"comment":null},{"amount":63.64,"local_amount":31818.18,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":32837.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440266,"comment":null},{"amount":63.64,"local_amount":31818.18,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":32837.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135634,"comment":null},{"amount":63.63,"local_amount":31818.18,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":32837.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033435,"comment":null},{"amount":63.64,"local_amount":31818.18,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":32837.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620809,"comment":null},{"amount":63.64,"local_amount":31818.18,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:08Z","rounded_local_amount":32837.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019802,"comment":null},{"amount":63.65,"local_amount":31818.18,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":32837.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242571,"comment":null},{"amount":63.64,"local_amount":31818.18,"processed_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":32837.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678071,"comment":null},{"amount":63.64,"local_amount":31818.18,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":32837.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112375,"comment":null},{"amount":63.6,"local_amount":31818.2,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":32837.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028036,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-13T23:03:14Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:08:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":73959,"name":"Iskandar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

After a long apprenticeship, she decided to become specialized in the commerce of smoked fish.  Today, she is 48 years old and in a polygamous arrangement, living with her husband and four children (one girl and three boys) in her own house in the Hamdallaye district of Koutiala Prefecture (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  With eighteen years of experience, she is in great demand and highly valued at the weekly fairs of the surrounding villages.  \r\n\r\nShe has had an association with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso for three years.  After four solidarity loans (group loans) and an individual loan, all correctly repaid, she is on her second individual loan.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy 10 large baskets of smoked fish in the Mopti region from fishermen (Bozos and Somonos) in order to stock up and to make retail sales, in bulk and for cash, at the fish market of the city of Koutiala and at the weekly fairs nearby to customers composed of retailers, homemakers, and restauranteurs.  \r\n\r\nShe intends to realize a monthly profit of 60,000 francs CFA, which will be used to cover the loan interest, to provide for the family, and the rest to boost working capital.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Thi Thuy has been a member of TYM fund since 2000. Before joining the fund, her family's economic situation was difficult with their main source of income from buying & selling scraps. Due to lack of capital, they were only able to bring in about 1.5 USD per day from this work. Since joining the fund, they were able to borrow additional money to invest in the business, and thus their income has been steadily rising. She was able to purchase a rice grinding machine to mill rice for the local community. Their income now averages 180 USD per month. For this loan, she wishes to borrow 425 USD to buy additional rice grinding machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Thu Ostrander, Kiva

To see a clip from the interview, check out the YouTube video at: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fvo6j84FKZ8. Tifa`s children are in the clip!\r\n\r\nTifa was born in 1982. She lives in Srebrenica, a village devastated by the Bosnian war in 1995.  In 1995, she was deported to Tuzla, where she lived until 2001 before returning to Srebrenica.  She is married, has two young daughters, and is studying law at a local university.  \r\n\r\nTo help support her family, Tifa requests a loan of 600KM from Women for Women, International, which she will use to invest in an agricultural project with her mother-in-law. Together, they will purchase the seeds and materials needed to grow and prepare a special corn-based product. The product is a mix of corn and grasses, and can be stored to feed cattle in the winter time. This is considered a specialty food for cattle, and is in high demand in Srebrenica. The corn and grasses will largely be grown and prepared by her mother-in-law, because Tifa is busy studying and taking care of her children.\r\n\r\nTifa\u2019s loan will be guaranteed by her

Even though she is only 19 yrs old, she already has a lot of experience in selling fruits. Currently with the help of her husband and a loan from TYM fund, her fruit selling business brings in 122 USD per month. In addition to her fruit business, another source of her income is from raising animals. Therefore, even though recently married, her family's income situation is quite stable.

She was borrowing to buy more ingredients to produce the desserts. Those loans helped her family to expand their production. Besides that, the family has now invested into the purchase of a plucking machine that the husband can use every season for an income of 4-6 million dong. For the next round, she would like to borrow 11 million dong to buy an additional, new plucking machine to serve others and improve further the family's revenues.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Linked by ties of kinship and profession, this group essentially trades in cow's milk and milk products (fresh milk, curdled milk, cream, and butter).  The group is on its seventh solidarity loan (group loan) with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.

This operation is repeated every two days if the profit margin is very large. \r\n\r\nThey each envision realizing an average profit of 40,000 francs CFA per cycle that will be used to cover family expenses and the rest to boost working capital. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":224622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy milk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana KOULIKORO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.7787 -6.9564","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nagnini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doukou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":68801.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350996,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:35:08Z","rounded_local_amount":68801.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974106,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":68801.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889481,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":68801.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440274,"comment":null},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":68801.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135642,"comment":null},{"amount":133.35,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":68801.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033443,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-01T20:59:13Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74011,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elena es madre de 4 hijos de 5, 9,12 y 7 a\u00f1os.

They live in traditional extended families with their husbands, co-spouses and children in the village of Marka-Coungo (in the Koulikoro region of the Republic of Mali). They met through neighborhood and marriage ties, and mainly sell firewood. In addition to firewood, they buy and sell miscellaneous items such as cereals and charcoal.\r\nKeen to build up a decent stock in order to avoid shortages, a year ago they decided, as a group, to join the loan program of the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. Having successfully repaid two previous solidarity loans (group loans), they are now on their third loan.\r\nThey plan to use this loan to stock up on firewood to sell at the market in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali). The firewood is bought in conjunction with peasants holding a wood-cutting permit (in Marka-Coungo and surrounding villages) and stored in the bush until the women obtain the desired quantity. They then arrange for trucks to take it to Bamako where wholesalers pay cash for the entire load.  On the way back, they buy miscellaneous items to sell in Marka-Coungo.\r\nThrough this loan they expect to make an average monthly profit of CFA 35,000, which will be used to strengthen their working capital and help their husbands meet the family expenses. Their goal is to create an association to promote and safeguard the interests of the firewood sellers in Marka-Coungo.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":224634,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana KOULIKORO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.7787 -6.9564","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diasson ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:34:21Z","rounded_local_amount":103202.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974107,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889482,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440275,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135643,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033444,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T12:51:04Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74016,"name":"Christiana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Christiana A. is married and has 4 dependants.

With the goal of providing for her small family, she got started very early on in the commerce of dried chili peppers.  This is a business that generates very good income, especialy in times of shortages.  But in order to be able to make it happen, buying and creating an inventory must occur first.  With this concern in mind, she is requesting a loan that, when granted, will be very beneficial to her, since she can double her income in times of shortages, thus having a very positive impact on her family's standard of living.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

They live in traditional extended families with their husband, co-wives, brothers, sisters, children and other parents in the city of the sub-prefecture Fana (Koulikoro region, Republic of Mali).  Linked by ties of work and community, these women do commerce exclusively in 'Wax' pagnes (highly prized cloth in West Africa). \r\n\r\nConcerned about satifying a burgeoning customer base, the women have joined the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which they are on their eighth group loan (solidarity loan).  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid. \r\n\r\nThey intend to pay for 300 lengths of pagnes in Bamako (capital of Mali) from wholesalers.  These lengths of cloth will be cut into three and resold retail, cash or credit accepted, in the marketplaces of Fana, Konobougou, Dio\u00efla, Massigui, etc. to customers essentially composed of women.  They each envision realizing a profit of 45,000 francs CFA, which will be used to boost their working capital.  Their ambition is to become wholesalers and to establish a relationship with a Dutch factory that makes 'Wax' pagnes.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":224640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy Wax pagnes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana KOULIKORO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.7787 -6.9564","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Massitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:48:24Z","rounded_local_amount":126852.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350997,"comment":null},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":126852.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974108,"comment":null},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":126852.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889483,"comment":null},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":126852.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440276,"comment":null},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":126852.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135644,"comment":null},{"amount":245.85,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:33Z","rounded_local_amount":126852.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033445,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-10T03:18:52Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74022,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Elizabeth Y. is married and has 5 dependants.

The group members each hope to realize an average profit of 30,000 francs CFA per month that they plan to use for covering the costs of health care and education for the children. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":224666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"To buy condiments ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana KOULIKORO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.7787 -6.9564","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ka\u00efra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Batoma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dounomba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nagnini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":491.67,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":253705.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974111,"comment":null},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":126852.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889486,"comment":null},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:02Z","rounded_local_amount":126852.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440279,"comment":null},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":126852.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135647,"comment":null},{"amount":245.84,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":126852.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033448,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T13:03:25Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74037,"name":"Mamadou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mamadou D. est un commer\u00e7ant ag\u00e9 de 25 ans  il est c\u00e9libataire .son activit\u00e9 principale est la vente de produits de premiere necessit\u00e9  sourtout des denr\u00e9es alimentaires .Il est societaire de la caisse depuis 3 mois  .Avec le pret sollicite il renforce son activite par l achat de quantite importante de marchandises.

Christiana obtains her supply of charcoal from the surrounding villages of Jamani in the Eastern region of Ghana (where she lives), and she sells such charcoal at retail prices to her customers. <p>\r\n\r\nNow, she is requesting a loan to buy charcoal in bulk to thereby increase her inventory of charcoal. Moreover, she hopes that the loan proceeds will enable her to increase her savings in order to pay for her children\u2019s school fees. <p>\r\n\r\nChristiana is a member of the community group known as the Knowledge Trust Group. In this group, members guarantee each others' loans as social collateral to ensure that their respective loans are promptly repaid.

The price of potatoes has gone up by almost 100% recently, from about .60 soles\/kilo to 1.20 soles\/kilo, so this loan will allow Roc\u00edo to buy about 400 kilos of potatoes. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Roc\u00edo hopes to expand her business. She would like to acquire a bigger space to work in, since her house is a bit cramped. She would then like to process more potatoes to begin working on an industrial level.\r\n<p>\r\nRoc\u00edo has been working with FINCA for about a year and has been a very responsible client. Her husband is also a member of a FINCA village bank, and has been working with the institution for several years now. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":224830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Buy potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T11:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel Rocio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:49:56Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932709,"comment":null},{"amount":54.06,"local_amount":166.34,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":167.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10214983,"comment":null},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":167.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396713,"comment":null},{"amount":108.34,"local_amount":333.34,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":334.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088422,"comment":null},{"amount":54.15,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:09:15Z","rounded_local_amount":167.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35981891,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-13T16:36:31Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:09:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74085,"name":"Seccelambras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Ccejelambras esta integrado por socias que viven en L. comunidad D.

This is 40-year-old Flora N. from Mwanza, a beautiful city on the shores of Lake Victoria. (Lake Victoria is famous not only because it is one of the largest lakes in the world, but also because it feeds the Nile River, a very important source of life for Africa.) Flora is married and has one child who is 17 years old.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince 2007 Flora has been selling traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called vitenge. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print that is printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile--the various colors, patterns, writings, and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. Flora works at the business 9 to 12 hours a week, 6 days a week. She is requesting a loan of $400  in order to purchase additional vitenge in bulk for resale. Flora thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

from Tanzania! This is 35-year-old Saidat S. from Mwanza, a beautiful city on the shores of Lake Victoria.

Additionally, she is responsible for supporting 1 dependent because he is an orphan. \r\n<p>\r\nSince 1989 Saidat has been raising and selling ducks.

This is 35-year-old Hamisa R. from Mwanza, a beautiful city on the shores of Lake Victoria. (Lake Victoria is famous not only because it is one of the largest lakes in the world, but also because it feeds the Nile River, a very important source of life for Africa.)  Hamisa is married and has 3 children between the ages of 7 and 12. \r\n<p>\r\nSince 2006, Hamisa has been selling traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called vitenge. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with a wax print that is printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile--the various colors, patterns, writings, and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.  Hamisa works at her business 1 to 4 hours a day and is assisted by her sister. \r\n<p>\r\nHamisa currently earns about $25 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to expand her business by purchasing additional vitenge in bulk, and to diversify her business by purchasing shoes and kanga. A kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric, often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its colorful pattern in frames. A kanga is a very useful item because it can be used as as either a wrap-around or a towel. Hamisa thanks you in advance for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

(greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 37-year-old Asha Kasanqu from Mwanza, a beautiful city on the shores of Lake Victoria. (Lake Victoria is famous not only because it is one of the largest lakes in the world, but also because it feeds the Nile River, a very important source of life for Africa.) Asha is married and has 4 children between the ages of 2 and 17. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one other dependent. \r\n<p>\r\nFor the past 2 years Asha has been running a mama lishe. A mama lishe is a restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania that usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), and plantains (cooked savory bananas), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. I was happy to discover she also serves up my favorite Tanzanian delight, vitumbuwa.  Vitumbuwa is made out of rice, sugar, water, and eggs (optional), and is deep-fried to create a slightly sweet, puffy yet dense pancake of sorts.  It is a \"must try\" if you ever find yourself in Tanzania!\r\n<p>\r\nAsha works at her business 6 days a week. She currently earns about $75 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to purchase ingredients for her menu items at her mama lishe, including rice, sugar, and cooking oil. Asha thanks you for supporting her business!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Aujourd\u2019hui, avec la multiplication des besoins du m\u00e9nage, le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de la vie ch\u00e8re et son faible pouvoir d\u2019achat, elle ne parvient m\u00eame plus \u00e0 satisfaire aux besoins \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de ses bouches \u00e0 nourrir. Au m\u00eame moment sa client\u00e8le augmente mais son faible pouvoir d\u2019achat ne lui permet pas de la satisfaire pour bien rentabiliser son activit\u00e9. Pour toutes ces raisons, elle sollicite un cr\u00e9dit pour renforcer son commerce et r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de son m\u00e9nage.\n \n","en":"Mrs. Aubine K., 30, is a widow raising 3 children. For more than 5 years, she has been selling condiments and vegetables, from which business she  supports her family. Today, as the needs of her household are growing, with living costs high and her buying power reduced, she can no longer manage to make ends meet so as to cover the most basic expenses of her brood. At the same time, her clientele is growing but her low buying power does not allow her to meet their needs and make her business really profitable.  For all these reasons, she is requesting a loan to bolster her business so she can support her household adequately. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":224977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"sale of vegetables, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Aklakou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.333333 1.716667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":22,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T19:30:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aubine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42146.92},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42779.12},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43420.81},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44072.12},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44733.2},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45404.2},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46085.27},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46776.54},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47478.19},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48190.37},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48913.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":82.19},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.42},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.23},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.54},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.87},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.21},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.58},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.97},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":82.19,"local_amount":42146.92,"processed_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":42409.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9960467,"comment":null},{"amount":83.42,"local_amount":42779.12,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":43045.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14878709,"comment":null},{"amount":84.67,"local_amount":43420.81,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":43691.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20425947,"comment":null},{"amount":85.94,"local_amount":44072.12,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:47:19Z","rounded_local_amount":44346.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27119500,"comment":null},{"amount":87.22,"local_amount":44733.2,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":45011.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36014541,"comment":null},{"amount":88.54,"local_amount":45404.2,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":45686.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44598151,"comment":null},{"amount":89.87,"local_amount":46085.27,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":46372.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52992512,"comment":null},{"amount":91.22,"local_amount":46776.54,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":47067.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63213740,"comment":null},{"amount":92.58,"local_amount":47478.19,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":47773.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73643239,"comment":null},{"amount":93.97,"local_amount":48190.37,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:54:12Z","rounded_local_amount":48490.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87082844,"comment":null},{"amount":95.38,"local_amount":48913.26,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":49217.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96999101,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-14T00:35:02Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:36:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74108,"name":"Christina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (greetings!) from Tanzania!

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":224980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To buy additional equipment, such as hair dryers, for her salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T01:20:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970759,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886976,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436236,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130508,"comment":null},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027305,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-15T03:26:13Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74109,"name":"Afi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 2 enfants, Madame K.

"en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 28-year-old Mariamu S. from Mwanza, a beautiful city on the shores of Lake Victoria. (Lake Victoria is famous not only for being one of the largest lakes in the world, but also because it feeds the Nile River, a very important source of life for Africa.)\r\n<p>\r\nMariamu is single, with one child who is 7 years old. She has been running a used clothing store since 2007.  Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe. They are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers who re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost and the general appeal of anything modern. \r\n<p>\r\nMariamu works at her business for  9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week. She currently earns about 100 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to purchase additional used clothing for resale. Mariamu thanks you for supporting her business!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":224986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To purchase additional used clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T00:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariamu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T09:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970760,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886977,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436237,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130509,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027306,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613325,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010408,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232719,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664535,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105266,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-13T05:13:11Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74112,"name":"Ayoko","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 3 enfants \u00e0 charge, Madame K.

(greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 23-year-old Zubeda Harufani from Mwanza, a beautiful city on the shores of Lake Victoria. (Lake Victoria is famous not only for being one of the largest lakes in the world but also because it feeds the Nile River, a very important source of life for Africa.)\r\n<p> \r\nZubeda is married, with one child who is 3 years old. Zubeda has been running a plastic business since 2005. She purchases rolls of clear plastic, cuts the plastic, and seals one end to make bags that closely resemble the bags you receive when you purchase a fish from the fish store. She then bundles several bags together and sells them to vendors of all sorts, who may pile tiny mangos or figs into the bags to sell to people who pass by foot, car, or daladala (mini city buses).\r\n<p>\r\nZubeda is requesting a loan of $400 in order to purchase additional plastic material and a machine that cuts the plastic. Zubeda thanks you for supporting her!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":224998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","use":"To purchase plastic material to make bags and a machine that cuts the plastic","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-12T23:50:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zubeda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T09:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970762,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886979,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436239,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130511,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:25:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027308,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613327,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010410,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232721,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664537,"comment":null},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105268,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2008-11-13T15:32:32Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":74117,"name":"Degninou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Degninou F. est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 42 ans, mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de 3 enfants tous \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole.

from Tanzania! This is 34-year-old Maida M. from Mwanza. She is married with two children, ages five and 14. Maida has been running a household products stand since 2006. Vendors that sell household products in Tanzania either sell them on a blanket on the street or in a store. The items they sell vary from ladles to dishwashing racks to soap. She works at the business for nine hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by her husband. Maida currently earns about 150 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 325 USD in order to buy more stock in bulk in order to resell them. Maida thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.

A typical maize business is a stand on the side of the road where maize is often piled high in baskets. Customers can scrutinize the quality of the product before purchase and specify the exact amount they would like to purchase. Hadasa works at the business for 12 hours per day, five days per week and is assisted by her brother. Hadasa currently earns about 250 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 450 USD in order to buy more stock of maize. Hadasa thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania.

from Tanzania! This is 35-year-old Magdalena M. from Mwanza. She is married with four children between the ages of eight and 18 years. Magdalena has been running an African clothes business since 2006. She sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is an expressive textile: the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. Magdalena works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week. Magdalena currently earns about 120 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase more African clothes to resell. Magdalena thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.

from Tanzania! This is 48-year-old Joyce S. from Mwanza. She is married with four children, between the ages of 10 and 17. Joyce has been running a kuku farm since 2008.\r\n<P>\r\nRaising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so you can sometimes just let them run around your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.\r\n<P>\r\nJoyce works at this kuku business for eight hours per day, seven days per week. Joyce currently earns about 200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to buy 200 chickens. In the future, she plans to further increase the number of her chickens. Joyce thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

It is printed using the silkscreen method and has its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is an expressive textile: the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. In addition, Agnes runs a tailoring business where she can sew those fabrics purchased in her store to the specifications of her customers. She works at this business for six hours per day, 12 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Agnes currently earns about 100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in  order to purchase another sewing machine. Agnes thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania.

She joined the Fund in 2001. Before joining the Fund, the family's income was essentially relying on farming, planting vegetables and selling rice. Over the last 7 years with the Fund, the family's economy has evolved considerably. With the profits from the loans, the family was able to invest into a rice processing machine, serving the needs of the farmers in the area. Currently, the family's income is about 3.000.000\u0111 per month. For the next round, she would like to borrow 9.000.000\u0111 to invest into stock for the rice-selling business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Minh Bui, Kiva

Thi Vu, 51 years old, has just joined the Fund for a little more than a year.  Currently she is running a street food stall at the local market, and her husband helps with preparing the food as well as bringing the raw ingredients home.  Although she has just joined the Fund, she borrowed the loan limit of 5 million VND which helped her family increase their income.  With an income of 2 million VND\/month, the family can guarantee that they will be able to repay the loan as well as improve their standard of living.  In this coming round of funding, she would like to borrow 9 million VND to buy chairs and tables and raw foods to use in their food stall business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi
