is married. After graduating from the college of commerce, she worked for a time as a market vendor. She was the only breadwinner in the family and wasn\u2019t able to earn much income. Financial problems brought out her tenacity and innovation, however, and she decided to start her own small business. Today she has a small kiosk selling casual and dressy outerwear for women in one of the local markets. \r\n\r\nIrina is a focused, hard worker. She puts in long hours trying to keep her business sustainable. One of her greatest joys is the one-on-one interaction she is able to have with her customers. She has had a great history with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d having repaid each of the 12 loans she has received. \r\n\r\nIrina would like to get a loan for $1,200 to open a new vending facility and re-supply her inventory. She is planning to purchase a variety of clothing items and will significantly expand her trade with a second location. Irina believes that having an assortment of women\u2019s outerwear that is both practical and fashionable will increase her sales and offer both warmth and style suitable to any taste and weather.

is married and lives in the town of Pavlograd. After finishing medical school, she wasn\u2019t able to find a good job in her field of training so she decided to become self-employed and start her own business selling women\u2019s outerwear in the local market. \r\n\r\nIrina received her first loan from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d in June of 2006. She understands the value of having readily available lending resources to help her business grow and succeed. \r\n\r\nIrina is requesting a loan of $1,200 to increase her turnover capital. She is planning to purchase women\u2019s seasonal clothing in bulk to widen her assortment of inventory for spring and summer. A variety of good quality, durable clothes will help boost Irina\u2019s sales and generate additional profit. Eventually, Irina is planning to invest additional income into the expansion of her business and would like to open a little vending store in downtown Pavlograd.

She has a small business selling clothing in one of the busiest city markets in Zaporozhye. She has been in this business for 8 years. Presently, Olga has about $800-1,000 of working capital. Her monthly net profit amounts to $200-300. \r\n\r\nOlga is a focused, hard-worker. Her husband recently died of cancer so Olga was forced to work long hours to provide for her younger daughter who lives with her. Her integrity and good reputation make her a pleasant person to work with. She has received and repaid all loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d without any delinquencies. \r\n\r\nOlga is requesting a loan for $850 to re-stock her inventory before the spring and summer seasons. She is planning to purchase a variety of clothing such as terry-cloth bathrobes, shoes, and men\u2019s and women\u2019s sweaters that always sell well in the   spring. Olga believes that hard work in combination with financial assistance will help to sustain and expand her business and continue to provide for her needs.

is married with two children. She has much rich experience working as a bookkeeper, a quality check manager, and as a market vendor. Today she runs a business selling headwear for men and men\u2019s underwear.  She has been in this business for 6 years.\r\n\r\nLudmila recently opened a new vending facility in one of the local markets. Her 18-year-old son is actively helping her with sales, which helps him earn enough to pay for his college fees. Loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have assisted in the growth of Ludmila\u2019s business. Presently, she has about $1,500 of working capital. Her monthly net profit amounts to $200-300.   \r\n\r\nLudmila is requesting a loan of $1,000 to buy inventory for the new vending kiosk. She is planning to purchase good quality men\u2019s underwear at wholesale prices for further retail sale.   Ludmila believes that offering a variety of clothing items will help her retain existing clients, find new ones and provide superior service in a competitive marketplace. Maintaining a good balance between price, quality and availability of products will promote further stable expansion of her trade and ensure better living standards for her family.

is married with two sons. She runs a small tool grinding and key manufacturing workshop. She chose to enter this type of business because there were few other entrepreneurs offering the same services. Oksana has been in business now for 10 years. Her sons are actively involved helping her in this family business. Currently, she has about $2,000 of working capital. Her monthly net profit amounts to $400-500. \r\n\r\nOksana is very enterprising and full of creative ideas. Her reasonable pricing policy and client-friendly service have always been priorities in her work and have helped to ensure the success of her business. Oksana has a perfect record with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d having promptly repaid each loan she has received. \r\n\r\nOksana is requesting a loan for $600 to purchase billets for manufacturing keys and to purchase some dies, moulds and necessary spares for her tool and cutting grinders. Oksana has also recently launched a new business venture. She built a small greenhouse in her yard and has started growing onions, cucumbers and tomatoes that she will be able to sell. Oksana is planning to invest generated profits from her established business into her greenhouse venture. She believes that having different businesses will help her minimize sales risk and provide stable financial support for her family. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041e\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u2013

She has been in this line of work for over 15 years. In order to get started she and her husband had to save money to invest in a cart. She began selling the products right out of her home and she has been very popular for many years. She makes chicken, hotdogs, fries and other foods for people on the go.

Being a sociable person, she relates easily with her clients. Every time you pass by her kiosk you can find her talking to a new person who will most likely end up buying something.\r\n\r\nMariya is requesting a loan for $1,200 to re-stock her inventory. She is planning to purchase a variety of suits, jackets, coats and sweaters in bulk for further retail sale. Mariya has proven to be a good steward of the money she has received in the past. We believe she will have no problem managing this loan efficiently and repaying it on time. The loan will be beneficial to her business by promoting its expansion which will further assist Mariya in meeting her household expenses and allow her to set aside some savings for future needs.

She brings much joy to children whose parents buy them small pets and necessary equipment. She assists many people in improving their homes by offering a wide variety of wall-paper in her other kiosk. Natalya\u2019s business strategy of having both kiosks side by side has helped her save the expense of hiring additional personnel to help her with retail. With 10 years of experience running these two different businesses, Natalya continues to reinvest profits into the development of her trade.  Also, as a mother, she strives to be successful so that she can see her son graduate from college. Paying for his schooling is currently one of her biggest financial priorities.\r\n\r\nNatalya is requesting a loan for $500 to expand her assortment of available wall-paper before springtime and the

is married and has two sons, one of whom is physically challenged. A college graduate, she runs a small business selling women\u2019s clothing in the central city market in Kherson. She believes that one of the biggest advantages of her work is a flexible schedule that gives her the opportunity to take good care of her disabled son. \r\n\r\nOlga has been in business for seven years. She has promptly repaid a total of seven loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. Her attentiveness and creativity have helped her develop a good understanding of what her clients need and want. They always feel complimented when she goes out of her way to help them with their selections. This has naturally boosted Olga\u2019s sales and led to growth in her business.\r\n\r\nOlga is requesting a loan for $1,000 to enable her to significantly expand her business by purchasing a new vending facility. She is also planning to re-stock her existing kiosk and purchase a supply of inventory for her new vending location. Olga is hoping to reinvest generated income into further expansion of her business. She believes that consistent growth will help her provide a stable source of income and continue to secure her family\u2019s well-being.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u2013

and her husband live in Ivano-Frankivsk which is located in the western part of the Ukraine. After high school she began working as a market vendor. However, Vita had a desire to start her own business so she opened a small kiosk selling children\u2019s clothing in the central city market. She has now been in business for 6 years. \r\n\r\nVita has a perfect credit history with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. She has promptly repaid 18 loans that she has received from the organization. Lending services have promoted the consistent expansion of her small business. Currently, she has about $3,000 in working capital. Her monthly net profit amounts to $1,000.  \r\n\r\nVita is requesting a loan for $1,200 to increase her inventory of clothing. She is planning to purchase 40 pajamas, 60 t-shirts, and several hundred pairs of socks. Vita believes that a good assortment of clothing items will attract many customers, increasing her sales profits and helping the success of her business. Vita is hoping to invest generated income into the further expansion of her business and eventually open a new vending facility.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0412\u0456\u0442\u0430 \u0442\u0430 \u0457\u0457

is a graduate of the Moscow Law School. For over ten years he worked as an investigator. Seven years ago he decided to resign and start his own small business. He now operates a little kiosk selling women\u2019s clothing in one of the busiest local markets. Mikhayil currently has about $2,000 of working capital and his monthly gross revenue amounts to $1,000. His business is the only source of income for his family. \r\n\r\nMikhayil is a very responsible and enterprising business owner. These qualities have helped him repay 5 loans he has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. Mikhayil is also very cheery and eager to meet the needs of his customers. This helps him create a positive perception of his business and leads to satisfied, repeat customers.\r\n\r\nMikhayil is requesting a loan for $1,200 to purchase 80 sets of pants and 100 skirts to re-supply the clothing inventory for his kiosk. A variety of good quality, classy dresses, suits and pants will help boost his sales and generate additional profit. Mikhayil believes that his business and marketing abilities in combination with financial assistance will help him increase his income and success.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0456\u043d\u0447\u0438\u0432 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443

After going to college to become a teacher she couldn\u2019t find a job in her field. Her family was facing a tough financial situation at the time so she decided to take a risk and start her own small business. Today Anna runs a small kiosk selling shoes in the local market. \r\n\r\nAnna is a determined entrepreneur. She knows how to set goals and achieve them. Anna recognizes that financial assistance from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d has provided significant support for her business and has promoted its stable growth. \r\n\r\nAnna is requesting a loan for $1,200 to increase her turnover capital which will allow her to re-supply her inventory and increase her sales. Eventually, Anna is hoping to rent a bigger vending facility and open her own little shoe store. She believes that financial assistance in combination with her zeal, perseverance and diligent work will someday help her dream come true. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0413\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430

lives with his wife and daughter in Berdansk, a city on the Sea of Azov. He runs a small business selling automotive lighting systems and accessories. He has been in this business for six years and has been quite successful. Currently, Roman has about $6,000 of working capital. His monthly gross revenue amounts to $3,000.    \r\n\r\nRoman is a very polite and affable businessman. His kiosk offers a variety of exclusive, good-quality inventory. Exceptional prices and a willingness to make sure that his customer\u2019s needs are met help him stay competitive and maintain repeat clientele. A nice, convenient location for his business also adds to the success of his trade. \r\n\r\nRoman is requesting a loan of $1,000 to remodel his vending pavilion and purchase some additional inventory. He is planning to buy some new shelves and stands, paint and insulate the walls of his pavilion and purchase assorted headlights for further retail sale. He believes that financial assistance in combination with his hard work and perseverance will contribute much to the successful growth and increased profitability of his business.

is married and has a grown son. He runs a small business providing personal vehicle owners and enthusiasts with vehicle related products. Currently, he has built up around $6,000 in working capital and has a monthly net profit of around $500. \r\n\r\nSergey is very knowledgeable and professional in his trade and relates well with his car-loving customers. He tries to conduct his business to provide a minimum hassle experience. Sergey has a talent for making every customer feel valued and appreciated, even after the sales process is complete. Many times he will offer after-sales help such as assisting with an installation. This also helps him stay competitive in a tough auto parts sales market. \r\n\r\nSergey would like to receive a loan of $1,200 for a couple purposes. First of all, he is planning to do some electrical improvements to his vending facility. Secondly, he would like to get a better supply of spare parts to sell, such as radiators, crankshafts, generators and starters for different types of vehicles. Sergey believes that good parts availability and reasonable prices will help many of his clients obtain the items they need and accomplish their repair goals, which will help him maintain his leading position in the market and continue to expand his business.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0456\u0439 \u2013 \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u0432

is married and has two grown children. She runs a small business selling infant supplies in the local market. There are very few other entrepreneurs involved in this area of sales so it has been a good business for her and meets the needs of many customers. Presently, Valentina has about $2,000 of working capital. Her monthly net profit amounts to $600. \r\n\r\nValentina does her best to please her customers in every detail. She is very professional and always tries to have accurate knowledge about her products. These qualities in combination with financial assistance from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have promoted the success of Valentina\u2019s business. Over the 11 years she has been in business she has repaid 17 loans without any delinquencies. \r\n\r\nValentina is requesting a loan for $1,000 to help her buy a new vending facility. She has already found a good location for a new kiosk and is planning to supply it with an inventory of diapers, milk bottles, bibs, towels, and clothing. Valentina believes that the infant supplies she can offer will make parents lives a lot easier, their babies happier, and will help many moms and dads use their baby supplies budget wisely.

is married and has two grown daughters. She has quite a varied work background. After finishing her schooling she worked for awhile in construction applying stucco finish to walls and buildings. Later she changed jobs and became a cleaner in an office building. The money she was making was not enough to support the basic needs of her family, however, so she decided to start her own business. For the last five years, she has had a small vending kiosk selling children\u2019s clothing in the central city market. It is the only source of income for her family. \r\n\r\nKaterina realizes the value of lending services which have promoted growth and contributed to the success of her small business. She has maintained a perfect credit history with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d, repaying a total of ten loans. Currently, she has built up around $2,000 of working capital. Her monthly gross profit amounts to $800.\r\n\r\nKaterina is requesting a loan of $1,000 to buy assorted inventory. She is planning to refresh her clothing supply with a variety of pajamas, t-shirts, socks and other clothing. One of Katerina\u2019s long-term plans is to open a new vending facility in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk. She believes that her optimism and tenacity in combination with financial assistance will continue to move her toward success and higher profits.

All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default.

The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks. \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention force.\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worst when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, rice farmers lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.

He is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but it is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walter has been farming rice with his family his entire life. On his plot of land he also has some fruits such as papaya and pineapple. As a second source of income Walter raises cattle. He needs the loan because of the bad water situation in his land. He hopes he can invest in a good watering system in order to improve his production. <\/p>\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention force.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worst when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, rice farmers lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>

She lost her mother in 2004 to the dreaded AIDS. She came from a single parent family. \r\n\r\nA women\u0092s group by the name WOFAK (Women Fighting AIDS in Kenya) knew her mother so they sponsored Agnes for hairdressing and beauty training at the Alternative School of Hairdressing from 2005 to 2006. Agnes was one of the best students and was offered employment at the Blue Yellow Hair Salon in Hurlingham. \r\n\r\nAgnes started saving and by the time she left her job to look after her younger sister, who is year years old and HIV positive, she had saved USD 357. With these savings, Agnes bought hair relaxing chemicals, rollers, a blowdryer, towels and some chairs.  She then rented a shop from where she has been operating. With her income, she is able to feed, educate and buy medicine for her sister. On a sad note Agnes and her 8 siblings (four brothers and four sisters) were disowned by her mother\u2019s relatives after they learned that she was HIV positive. So after burying her mother, Agnes took full responsibility of raising her siblings.   \r\n  \r\nAgnes has been experiencing difficulties due to stiff competition from neighboring salons, which are fully equipped. A few clients have left. Agnes has been trying to do after-sales services, such as offering a free hair wash, in order to retain some of her clients. She senses that if they continue to leave, she will be left with no income to feed herself and her siblings. Agnes is therefore requesting a loan of USD 625 to help her purchase a dryer, steamer, blowdryer, four chairs, training dummy and a 14-inch television set. With this additional equipment, Agnes will be able to compete with her fellow competitors and hopes that with time she will win her clients back. She will also be able to give her customers quick and efficient service and in turn increase her income.\r\n\r\nDue to the harsh situation that Agnes went through, i.e. rejection and neglect from her close relatives, Agnes has taken 2 orphaned girls and is training them in hairdressing. She has been able to overcome obstacles in her life and does not want girls in similar conditions to suffer like she did. \r\n\r\nAfter buying the equipment, Agnes will employ two other people. This will translate into higher income that will enable her to support her siblings. Agnes intends to repay the loan in 8\u201315 months.    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":21331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"To purchase a dryer, steamer, blowdryer, four chairs, training dummy and a 14-inch television set.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kayole, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-03-27T05:56:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-10T16:03:26Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":625,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2007-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2007-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2007-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2007-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2007-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2007-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2007-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":78.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":78.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2007-05-27T09:17:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17714,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":79,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T09:17:56Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26535,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":79,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T09:20:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36040,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":79,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2007-08-27T09:22:41Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47072,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":79,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T09:23:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59370,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":79,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2007-10-27T09:25:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":72744,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":79,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2007-11-27T10:26:06Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87510,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103625,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-27T16:03:26Z","paid_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":13,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":6976,"name":"Eunice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eunice Atieno O. is 41 years old and married with 5 children. She also looks after 13 dependents: 10 are orphans. Three children are from his brother, who together with his wife died of AIDS in 2002. Another seven children are from another brother who had two wives, of which one passed away. The brother is currently on antiretroviral drugs (drugs that boost immunity of people living with HIV\/AIDS). She is also living with her grandmother and her nephew (whose mother is Eunice\u2019s sister) and depends on her for clothing and education.  \r\n                                                                           \r\nEunice started her business in 1995 after having finished a hairdressing course from Pilkington College in Kampala, Uganda. There she got a certificate in hairdressing. After completion of her course, her husband bought her a dryer, blowdryer, rollers, five chairs, a sink and hair-relaxing chemicals so that she could start a salon. Her husband told her that he had loaned her the items so she had to pay him back. Since Eunice had already saved Ksh. 35,000 (USD 500) through the selling of clothes and shoes in 1993 and 1994, she had no problem repaying the items within two years. The business was doing well until  February this year when a fire broke out at her business premises. Seemingly good samaritans, who came in the pretext of helping her, stole her possessions including her dryer, blowdryer, sink, plastic chairs, mirrors and hair chemicals.

Having not completed his secondary school education, Franklin decided to come to Nairobi from his home in the Kisii district to try his luck in the capital city. \r\n\r\nFortunately, he had a cousin who owned a metal workshop.  He was able to assist with tasks at the workshop which gave him work exposure. After about 6 months he left and was employed at a firm named  Joaki Enterprises within the city. That was in 2000. Franklin was lucky and got a contract to make windows and doors for Ksh 17,000 (USD 243). With this kind of money, he decided that it was time to be on his own. Through his savings and the money he earned from the contract, Franklin started his own workshop in September 2005. Since then the business has been doing well and has enabled him to put his eldest daughter into a boarding school in Kakamega, the western part of Kenya.\r\n                                    \r\nThe only impediment to Franklin\u2019s business is that he doesn\u2019t have a grinder and drilling machine. Quite often he borrows from neighboring workshops, which are sometimes not willing to loan their equipment. Time and money is wasted negotiating for the equipment. Lately he has been losing business due to the lack of machines. \r\n\r\nTherefore Franklin is kindly asking for a loan of USD 200 to enable him to purchase the grinder and drilling machines. The new additions to his business will allow him do his work quickly and efficiently. This will bring back his clients and he will get contracts to make windows, doors and other welding related work. Franklin sees this as a way of creating job opportunities and intends to employ two more people to help him at the workshop.  This is because he envisions that he will have more work from additional contracts.  The repayment period for the loan is 8-15 months.        \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":21333,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"to purchase a grinder and drilling machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kibera Slums, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-03-27T20:40:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Franklin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-10T21:07:23Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-05-27T09:17:41Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17715,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T09:17:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26536,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T09:20:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36041,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-08-27T09:22:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47073,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T09:23:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59371,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-27T09:25:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":72745,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-27T10:26:09Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87511,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103626,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-27T21:07:23Z","paid_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":6978,"name":"Pamela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pamela Akeyo O. is 34 years old.

She is a high school dropout and hasn\u2019t undergone any training.\r\n<p>She started her business in 1994 to support her family and school-going children after her husband died. This is her second loan with PEMCI, but her first with Kiva. The first loan of $150 was used to equip her meat shop with essential equipment. With this second loan of $300, she plans to diversify her business into buying and selling cereals such as maize, beans, millet and other fodders. \r\n<p>Through her business, she has been able to promote her church's women's projects in the community. The women's groups are able to plant and export cereals. With time, other members of their A.C.K. church's women's group have been able to gain knowledge and skills and can now impart the skills in their own farms. \r\n<p>Grace is well educated for her community and is concerned in the uplifting of women's affairs.

She settled in Kampala.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHarriet is a lady with a passion to work hard for survival and sustenance. She has been a member of Life in Africa since 2006, and she is very active in the center. She is a supportive and responsible person who is also good at planning activities. Over time, she has developed the skill to face challenges and overcome them.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBefore Harriet joined Life in Africa, life was not easy in terms of general welfare. In her efforts to sustain herself, she searched for work. The work she discovered was with the stone quarry, where she did the stone digging and cracking. She was paid for the work she did. After some time of working at the stone quarry and witnessing others' success, Harriet got the idea to start her own stone quarry business. The stone-selling business is doing very well because of the massive developments of construction taking place.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe stone quarry business involves digging stones, cracking them into the desired sizes depending on the client's order, and delivering the cracked stones to the customers. Currently, Harriet has been producing two deliveries of stones supplied, getting a monthly profit of 90,000 Uganda shillings (UGX). (1USD = 1,722 UGX). She has been making two deliveries only due to limited capital. In order to be able to expand her business, she decided to ask for the loan. She expects to get an 45,000 UGX per delivery of stones made on a monthly basis.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo be able to succeed in this business, Harriet is planning to employ people to do the work as it is explained below in the budget.\r\n<br><br>\r\n        LOAN BUDGET\r\n<br><br>\r\n        For one (1) trip\r\n<br><br>\r\n        1)Digging stone 20,000 UGX\r\n<br><br>\r\n        2)Transfer fee 7,000 UGX\r\n<br><br>\r\n        3)Cracking fee 32,000 UGX\r\n<br><br>\r\n        TOTAL 59,000 UGX\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nShe plans to do 4 trips 59,000x4= 236,000 UGX\r\n<br><br>\r\n       4)Extra balance\/ emergency 14,000 UGX\r\n<br><br>\r\n       Total 250,000\/="}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":21448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Quarrying","sector":"Construction","use":"Facilitating laborers - stone digging and cracking","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Banda-Kireka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.266667 31.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":8,"posted_date":"2007-03-28T06:35:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-11T11:00:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-06-11T09:15:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-11T09:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":22142,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-07-11T09:15:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-11T09:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":30837,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-08-11T09:15:35Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-11T09:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41144,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T09:15:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-11T09:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52960,"comment":"scheduled_repayment"}],"funded_date":"2007-03-28T11:00:32Z","paid_date":"2007-09-11T09:15:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":7006,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph M. is a young unmarried man whose parents died and left him at a tender age.

In an effort to model a high standard of \r\nthe transparency we operating in Africa should uphold online, this \r\nrather long message contains details that are relevant to helping you \r\nunderstand what's already happened, and what's happening now in the Life in Africa community with regard to this \r\nissue. Rest assured, Kiva staff are aware of these issues and some have \r\npersonally met, face to face, a number of the personalities involved. We at LiA feel it's now high time to let you - our valued lenders - in on the sensitive nature of the challenges we've been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn September 2006, <b>some LiA community members<\/b> tasked to manage the loan program \r\nand the Invisible Children bracelet campaign <b>resigned amidst accusations of \r\nmismanagement<\/b> from other members in the Life in Africa community. In the process, which was painful but arguably very healthy for the community in important ways,  \r\na laptop was stolen that included the records for both programs, the WE Center \r\nwas closed for 2 weeks, and management of the invisible children project shifted \r\nto another site, taking 35 (of 80) Life in Africa members involved in the \r\nproject with them to be full time employees. Among the staff lost during all the disruption at that time included 4 of 7 people trained to process and manage LiA member loans. Those who were left with loans training were heaped with mountains of new community management responsibilities on their plates. Everything related to the loans program seemed upside down and got out of synch for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Most LiA borrowers experienced<\/b> a 1-3 month period after the September events \r\nwhen payments due to them from the Invisible Children bracelet project were \r\ndelayed. Many fell into <b>arrears on their loans<\/b> at that time. In most (but not \r\nall) of those cases, those arrears have now been paid up to date. However, in \r\nthe wake of September's disruption, the paper files for the loan program were \r\nalso left in disarray and the computerized records were gone. It took over 3 months \r\nfor David Ewaku, a Life in Africa Board Member, to reconstruct the records and \r\nget the partnerships with Kiva (esp. online) and Invisible Children somewhat \r\nback on track, so that <b>by January 2007 loan payments were coming in smoothly again<\/b>. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, part of why it took so long was that David fell very ill and has \r\nbeen in and out of <b>hospital<\/b> since November. By then, however, we had hired a recent MBA grad with experience in microfinance \r\nas full time accounts manager for the Life in Africa community. Yet another \r\ndisaster - the <b>new accounts manager<\/b> took over David's updated loan program records, and proceeded \r\nthrough <b>professional incompetence<\/b> to make a complete mess of them over the next 4 months. She \r\nresigned in mid-March 2007 after receiving a warning letter from the community operations team about her performance. \r\nWe now find ourselves consulting 3 different sources of information that are \r\nriddled with holes and mistakes in order to get an accurate picture of what our \r\nborrowers have actually paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a recent telephone discussion with Kiva staff about the apparent arrears in our loan portfolio, and with me hosting meetings in my home and participating in an advisory team for organizing Kiva's forthcoming ground-truthing efforts in East Africa this past week, we at LiA have been feeling a very keen sense of urgency about updating our payments on the Kiva website. Luckily, the community has Grace - our star community leader\/borrower who is  \r\nfeatured in the PBS Frontline segment about Kiva. Over the past 2 years, she \r\nhas dedicated her heart and soul to uplifting Life in Africa's communities in \r\nboth Kampala and Gulu. Though she is no accountant, <b>Grace Ayaa has now committed herself to taking the LiA loan program's administrative challenges by the horns<\/b>. <br><br>Over the past 2 weeks Grace has been working with a small group of community \r\nmembers to figure out how to reconstruct the community's loan program records, so that more than \r\none person understands the process that's been used and everyone can agree on \r\nthe final updated report. I can see she is very determined to do this transparently and am grateful on \r\nbehalf of the LiA community to Grace for the leadership she's investing in \r\ngetting our payment and loan tracking system straight and systemized once and \r\nfor all.  In fact, she  had hoped to finish everything before leaving for a short trip to Gulu this \r\nmorning. Instead, <b>Grace and her group of committee members have asked me to appeal \r\ndirectly for lenders' patience<\/b>. They feel that getting this sorted out \r\nright means it should not be approached in haste - they need more time to talk to the borrowers one by one to compare their records & recollections with the office records to get an accurate final picture of where each member stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b><u>PLEASE NOTE:<\/u> To avoid that ALL of our members' online \r\nrecords are negatively affected any further by this internal administrative \r\ncrisis, we are today marking all scheduled member loan payments as paid up to \r\nthis month on the Kiva website. <\/b> The amount paid on each account has been determined by the Kiva bulk-payments  feature as the scheduled amount outstanding due to Kiva. Our community has, after all, guaranteed that \r\neach of these loans will be fully repaid to the lenders, regardless of each borrower's actual performance. Nonetheless, once we have all of this sorted out, we will update all of you (hopefully with next month's payments) on the accurate situation for your borrower with a link to the full \r\nand actual member repayment records for all loans guaranteed by the LiA \r\ncommunity in 2006. <b>In the cases where payments posted on Kiva were already up to date, I have posted a $1 payment to be able to alert all of our lenders to this message.<\/b> <br>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nI humbly hope you can <b>forgive us at LiA for not communicating with lenders earlier about the challenges<\/b> we've faced in keeping the payments on Kiva accurately recorded, and thank you for your continued patience as the community works in good faith to get the mess sorted out.  It is likely Kiva will be sending a Kiva Fellow to work with us during the summer months, which - combined with the lessons we've already learned - will undoubtedly help us stay on a better track as we now begin raising loan funds for more members in both Kampala and Gulu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, any <b>lenders with constructive support to offer, or with an interest in volunteering<\/b> with our microfinance program in Uganda, are most welcome to join us in dialogue at the Omidyar.net communuty and contact Grace Ayaa online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/\">http:\/\/www.omidyar.net\/group\/lia\/<\/a>.

He was born in Pader district and came to Kampala in October 2002 due to the rebel war which was terrible in that region of Northern Uganda and led to displacement of many people like him. When he came to Kampala, he had to settle in Acholi quarters where most of the displaced Acholi people live.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhile in Acholi quarters, he was working as a private security guard with the Hwan Sung company. That job came to an end when the company decided to recruit guards from a security organization. He had nothing to do until he joined the women in the Acholi quarters in making paper beads. That paved way for him to join Life in Africa in September 2006 when there was a position open for a security guard. He worked as a security guard in Life in Africa until February 2007 when he was given a position in a craft production team that earns him a better living.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSince he joined the organization, he has been so helpful to the organization and the other members. Through others members who have acquired this loan, he has seen how a small loan can change someone's life. That has inspired him to also try.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor his plan, he has discovered that building materials like stone are in a higher demand than ever before as there is massive construction and renovation of houses and roads in Kampala to meet the Commonwealth heads of government conference (CHOGM) due November 2007 in Uganda.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Acholi Quarter is located on a rocky hill, where stone can be easily sourced and laborers who know this work are available. When Jiponi gets this loan, he will begin by paying for the site right away, then hire people to dig out the stones. This may take him about a week. Then he will have the stones moved out of the pit, while those doing the crushing are also doing their part. In a week, the stones will be out, and about one and a quarter deliveries may be ready for sale, making a total of three deliveries per month.

Josephine is married to a pastor, so apart from her tailoring work, she also works part time to assist her husband with church work. Apart from her children who are now grown up and in various colleges, Josephine also has two dependent children that she supports through paying their school fees back at home. Being the wife of a pastor also requires her to offer support to the members of their church and she therefore also supports two single mothers and one widow who is also her employee.\r\n<p>\r\nJosephine started her dress-making business in order to sustain her family in 1992, after she received a loan of Ksh7,000 (USD100) from a local NGO. This loan was to be shared amongst three people and was meant to be used to start a business. The three started a small business in partnership, but within a short time, the other two partners requested that Josephine take over the loan repayment, and to employ and pay them on commission. Josephine later attended a two-year course training in embroidery, tie-dye and fashion design. With the new skills learned, Josephine began to make bridal wear, African attire and even began to make curtains. \r\n<p>\r\nSince then, her business has expanded from a small stall which three people shared, to the four stalls that she now owns in the Jericho market, one of the market areas in Nairobi. Josephine now seeks additional support in the form of a loan to enable her to buy bridal wear materials in bulk. For this, she seeks a loan of USD725 repayable within 6 \u2013 12 months. Purchase of these materials will enable her to cut the cost of the materials that she buys in small bits. This will also enable her to give reasonable prices to her customers, and will at the same time ensure that she gets higher income. This will improve the situation at her business, and will help her to continue to maintain her staff.

is a widowed mother of three children. After the death of her husband, Lesya had to find ways to provide for herself and her three kids. For fifteen years she has had a small business selling knitted wear for children. It has now become the main source of income for her family. \r\n\r\nLesya is a cheerful, hard-worker despite the difficulties she faces. She has received and repaid two loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d which have helped create stability for her business. Currently, Lesya has about $1,600 of working capital. Her monthly gross revenue amounts to $800.\r\n\r\nLesya is requesting a loan for $700 to re-supply her inventory before the spring season. She is planning to purchase 20 jackets, 20 sweaters and 70 clothing sets for different age groups of children. One of her long-term goals is to rent a second vending facility. In pursuit of her goal, Lesya plans to invest her extra profits into the expansion of her business.   \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041b\u0435\u0441\u044f \u2013 \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0432

is married and has a little son. He graduated from art school and eight years ago started a small business manufacturing furniture. He has built up about $1,600 in working capital. His monthly net profit amounts to $1,000.\r\n\r\nVladimir is a very determined hard-worker. His goal is to manufacture the best possible furniture at the best prices providing the best value to his customers. He recently moved his shop to a new location where he makes a range of products including dining room tables, coffee tables, book shelves, dressers and mirrors. Different furniture units available in a variety of colors and designs provide many options for each individual taste.  The competitive prices, affordable design and unique style of his durable, hand-made furniture attract many customers to his shop. \r\n\r\nVladimir is requesting a loan of $800 to purchase some necessary tools and wood materials for his workshop. He is hopeful that with his hard work, determination, and financial assistance his business will continue to be successful and provide himself and his family with stable, long term income.

W. is married, has three children and also lives with her younger brother. She decided to live with him to enable him search for a job since this is not easy in the rural areas. She is 36 years of age and lives in Kayole, an informal settlement area of Nairobi. Lucy and her husband are living positively with HIV. Her husband is a soldier while she sells second-hand shoes at Gikomba market. This is an open-air second-hand clothes and accessories market. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the year 2000, Lucy was given Ksh 10,000.00 (USD140) by her husband to enable her start the second-hand shoe business. She used the money to buy a bale of second-hand shoes and also to apply for a location to do her business, and was given a card that permits her to trade in that particular location. She previously used to sell with a friend for a period of one year and according to Lucy, this was a good exposure for her to master the skills required in the trade.\r\n<p>\r\nLucy buys one bale of second-hand shoes and this can last her one week before she can buy another one, though sometimes the stock does not last as long and so she is left with nothing to sell. Unlike her friends who buy two or three bales that can keep their businesses in operation before another container of bales is dispatched, her business is affected and records minimal sales. By buying two bales, Lucy will not run out of stock for at least for two weeks before she can be sure to buy another bale, hence striving to maintain her customers. The increased stock will also enable her to supplement the household needs. Lucy is therefore requesting a loan of USD150 to enable her purchase stock for her business, which she intends to pay back within 6 \u2013 12

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as <i>tontines<\/i>. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the <i>tontines<\/i> provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional <i>tontines<\/i> from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and has restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":22379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase
