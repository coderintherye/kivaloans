She will use these to build the wall of her home and the roof, so that during the rainy season water does not get into her home, thus providing better comfort and protection to her family. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":656.36,"image":{"id":821272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase construction supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:01:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1785.71},{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1785.71},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1785.71},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1785.71},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1785.71},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1785.71},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1785.71},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1785.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1785.71},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1785.71},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1785.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1785.71},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1785.71},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1785.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.36},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.35},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.36},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.36},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.35},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.36},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.36},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.35},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.36},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":98.63,"local_amount":2191.77,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2217.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226968434,"comment":null},{"amount":106.09,"local_amount":2357.62,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2385.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232727099,"comment":null},{"amount":88.49,"local_amount":1966.44,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1989.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238530965,"comment":null},{"amount":78.37,"local_amount":1741.62,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:04:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1761.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244490635,"comment":null},{"amount":118.62,"local_amount":2635.97,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250698901,"comment":null},{"amount":80.18,"local_amount":1781.77,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1802.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257102854,"comment":null},{"amount":85.98,"local_amount":1910.64,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1932.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263227941,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-05T08:31:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":320588,"name":"Rabiia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rabiia is a 33-year-old single woman who has been working in women's beauty and care for 20 years.

She keeps the pigs for three or four months until they're ready for market.

In 2007, Sullay established his motor spare parts business which includes tyres, brake pads, fan belts, batteries, windscreens, inner tubes, motor oil, etc. He began doing business when he was a small boy for his mother. When he became mature, he started his own business. \r\n\r\nSullay has a special interest in business because the income he gets from this business is used to provide his family's livelihood.  It is from his business proceeds that he has bought a car and two pieces of land. Working six days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan of SLL 3,000,000. Sullay requires a loan in order to buy 10 lift pumps, 50 oil filters, 50 universal joints and 10 brake kits. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately SLL 300,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Sullay plans to construct a house on his land from the proceeds of the business. By adding to his present capital, he will be able to maximize profits and send his first child to a nursery school in this coming academic year.

Paralelamente  cultiva alfalfa para venderla al por mayor. Por tal raz\u00f3n, no tiene un horario fijo, de trabajo, pero es muy constante en la realizaci\u00f3n de sus bordados ya que  por la complejidad del trabajo y el grosor del bordado en la tela este trabajo dura hasta un mes de realizado. Como resultado termina en una bella prenda  t\u00edpica que causa admiraci\u00f3n en sus clientes y finalmente son comprados al contado.

She has been doing embroidery by hand for three years. She began this at the invitation of one of her friends who taught her this trade, and now she works independently in the comfort of her home so she can take care of her house and her daughters. She also grows alfalfa to sell wholesale. For this reason, she does not have a fixed schedule, but she is very regular about doing her embroidery because the complexity of the work and the thickness of the embroidery on the cloth make one project take up to a month. She ends up with a beautiful traditional outfit that her customers admire, and that is finally paid for in cash.\r\n\r\nThe most profitable time for her business is during the traditional feast of Santiago (St. James), which is celebrated a lot in her area. Victoria wants to increase her production of embroidered skirts and to hire people to help her make them. This is her fifth loan with MFP.

She is married to a petty trader and has three children age 4, 6 and 14 years. \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Fannie established her used clothing business. She began her business because she was brought up by her aunt who did not let her go school because she is a prominent trader so everyone in her care must sell. Therefore, Fannie became a good trader. \r\n\r\nWhen she got married, her husband helped her with some funds to start her own business. Working seven days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about SLL 650,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of SLL 3,000,000. Fannie has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now she requires a new loan in order to buy one bale of used tops at SLL 700,000, one bale of girls dresses at SLL 750,000, one or two bales of dresses for toddlers at SLL 750,000. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately SLL 200,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Fannie plans to be a supplier to retailers who move to villages on market days. \r\n\r\nHer challenges include transport costs, price inflation and rains that sometimes stop customers from coming to the stall and even prevent her from hanging the items for display.  \r\n\r\nFannie plans to help her husband with some money to build a house for the family and open another stall for her nephew, who will be coming to stay with them. She is very much interested to visit the holy land, Mecca. \r\n\r\nShe wants to continue accessing loans because they lead her to do better things in the future and make good profits. She thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":507.5,"image":{"id":816491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To pay for assorted used clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-07-26T13:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fannie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":309937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226991398,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":309937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232750522,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-23T08:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":309937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239736551,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:23:03Z","rounded_local_amount":309937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244513852,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":309937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721672,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":309937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124589,"comment":null},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":309937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505505,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-02T21:21:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":320702,"name":"Raeda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raeda is a 28-year-old housewife.

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarife faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He says that the income that will be generated from this project will enable him to pay school fees for his children. In the future, he plans to acquire more dairy cows and buy a chuff cutter that will enable him to expand his dairy farm.\r\n\r\nJohn is 59 and married with three children who all attend school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":201.57,"image":{"id":822154,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To cultivate potatoes and cabbages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2011-08-02T09:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2157.05},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2214.05},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2273.05},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.05},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2394.05},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2458.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.05},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2589.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2658.05},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2728.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2800.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2872.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.17},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.52},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.21},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":34.42,"local_amount":2950,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3092.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227074712,"comment":null},{"amount":26.07,"local_amount":2234.98,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2342.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232835777,"comment":null},{"amount":26.76,"local_amount":2294.06,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2404.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238835134,"comment":null},{"amount":27.47,"local_amount":2354.7,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2468.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244602115,"comment":null},{"amount":28.2,"local_amount":2416.94,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2533.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250816539,"comment":null},{"amount":28.94,"local_amount":2480.83,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2600.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257225702,"comment":null},{"amount":29.71,"local_amount":2546.4,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2669.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263363915,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-02T11:00:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":320767,"name":"Silvestra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Silvestra is 54 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She hopes she stays capable of filling her customers needs and requests.\r\n\r\nShe hopes she can make a big exhibition for her drawings in the future and become well known in the region."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":871.5,"image":{"id":822198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","use":"To buy necessary materials to make requested baby souvenirs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Metn","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2011-07-26T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nabiha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":130.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226973155,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-16T07:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232731269,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:13:50Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238534801,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-20T08:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244494327,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-16T08:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250702427,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257299367,"comment":null},{"amount":124.5,"local_amount":124.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:18:01Z","rounded_local_amount":124.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317429,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-27T04:36:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":320808,"name":"Filomena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Filomena is 48 years old and lives in the Philippines.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five PHP\u2019s worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Emily profits by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. She also runs a tricycle unit (motorcycle with sidecar) and sells mineral water to the community. Her regular customers are her neighbors and those in the local community. She earns a minimum of 700 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<p>\r\nEmily is requesting a 21,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy groceries, various products and mineral water to expand her inventory. A portion of the loan will also be used for the maintenance of her tricycle unit. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n<p>\r\nEmily hopes to be able to grow her businesses soon, just as she hopes to hand them over to the next generation. She faithfully attends meetings with her co-fellowship* members every week where she shares stories of her work and draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five PHP\u2019s worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Isabel profits by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. She also runs a tricycle unit (motorcycle with sidecar) and sells ready-to-wear clothes to the community. Her regular customers are her neighbors and those in the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<p>\r\nIsabel is requesting a 14,000 PHP loan which she will use to buy groceries, various products and ready-to-wear clothes to expand her product inventory.

She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n<p>\r\nIsabel hopes to be able to grow her businesses soon, just as she hopes to hand them over to the next generation. She faithfully attends meetings with her co-fellowship* members every week where she shares stories of her work and draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Married and living with her husband. She is the mother of three children (two sons and one daughter). The elder son and daughter have their own families and live separately; the youngest son lives and studies in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nBurulush was born in a family of modest means: her father was a forester.  After graduating from high school in 1975, she was admitted to the program in Economics at the agricultural college of Bishkek. In 1980, before graduating from college, Burulush got married. A year later, in 1981, she gave birth to a son, and in 1982 to a daughter. Burulush switched to taking classes in the distance education format and did not abandon her studies. During the exam periods, her husband\u2019s parents, with whom they used to live in the Akh-Suu village (Moscow Region, Chujsk District) would help her take care of the children. Since Burulush\u2019 husband was the youngest son in his family, Burulush and her husband found themselves compelled to live in the village together with the husband\u2019s parents, where  they  used to keep some livestock and grow produce.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, after her in-laws passed away, Burulush and her husband decided to move  to the village of Panfilovskoe (Panfilov Region, Chujsk District), where they found employment in a local collective farm, bought a small house and started buying livestock with their earnings. In 2004, Burulush started working  at the local village council as a bookkeeper. Eventually they obtained a land plot and started growing barley and clover for animal feed. In 2008,  Burulush got a job as a senior specialist at the Agricultural Development Administration of the Panfilov Region. At present, Burulush has one dairy cow, one heifer, 14 heads of small livestock and one Moskvich-412  automobile. In the past few years, Burulush faced a lot of expenses because of the older children\u2019s marriages and the younger one\u2019s admission to the university. Therefore, in order to develop her business further, Burulush  turned to Bai Tushum & Partners  for a loan of 50,000 KGS intended for purchasing calves.\r\n\r\nBurulush plans to obtain more cattle, and in the future she dreams of buying a good family car. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":622.1,"image":{"id":822448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Panfilovka village","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T12:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burulush","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3843},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3735},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3825},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3917},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4012},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4109},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4208},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4310},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4414},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4521},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4630},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4476}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.47},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.04},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.13},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.98},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.31},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.72},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":86.47,"local_amount":3843,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3867.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226992112,"comment":null},{"amount":84.04,"local_amount":3735,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3759,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232751275,"comment":null},{"amount":86.06,"local_amount":3825,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3849.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238555495,"comment":null},{"amount":88.13,"local_amount":3917,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3942.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244514662,"comment":null},{"amount":90.27,"local_amount":4012,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4037.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722464,"comment":null},{"amount":92.45,"local_amount":4109,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4135.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125396,"comment":null},{"amount":94.68,"local_amount":4208,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4235.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250542,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-09T03:21:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":320945,"name":"Robert","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robert is 45 years old.

Therefore, she established the Osusu scheme, of which she was the leader. She was able to access funds and start her plastics business.

Each day she goes to the market to purchase the ingredients necessary to sell her product in the evening. She sells food on the sidewalk in front of her in-laws' house. She has been doing this for two years and she earns a good income to help support her household. She doesn't let anything go to waste and if she does not sell very much during the day, she uses the leftover ingredients to prepare dinner for her family. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her job is that she has free time in the afternoons to spend with her children, who are still very young and need to be close to their mother.

She hopes to be able to continue working and improving her business. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP. She enjoys working with this group because she gets along well with everyone and because they are always there to help each other out.

partiality to farming is like a byword in most of western Uganda.

If one does not end up farming, they will end up engaging in the other popular economic activities like raising goats and cattle \r\n\r\nA 35-year-old father of four, Patrick says for his case, he set forth in this business four years ago in Rukungiri.  Not so long, one may say, but he says he is already enjoying the experience of engaging in this business and he is already seeing better days on the horizon for his business. He has been basking in the glow of good business, principally after selling most of the crops he grows like bananas and cassava. The good spells he has enjoyed however, do not mean he has not bore witness to adversity. He says during some particular dry seasons, his business suffers bad harvests and consequently, he is not able to sell most of his harvests at good competitive market prices. This, at length, adversely affects his financial standing. Monthly, this business generates sales revenue to the tune of Ugandan shillings 150,000 and he says with this Kiva loan he is going to purchase hoes, pangas and high-grade manure to apply on his farms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":189.58,"image":{"id":822570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase hoes, pangas and high-grade manure ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-26T22:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":800000,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":66667,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T08:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":70444.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222022814,"comment":null},{"amount":27.09,"local_amount":66666.34,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":70443.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227249039,"comment":null},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":133333.66,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-22T09:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":140887.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868614,"comment":null},{"amount":27.09,"local_amount":66666,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":70443.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648453,"comment":null},{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":66667.02,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":70444.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313801,"comment":null},{"amount":27.08,"local_amount":66666.98,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:39Z","rounded_local_amount":70444.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275419,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-07-28T04:46:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":321003,"name":"Adeline In\u00e8s France","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":" Femme de 33ans, c\u00e9libataire et m\u00e8re de deux enfants scolaris\u00e9 \u00e2g\u00e9e de 6ans \u00e0 8ans.

She is 30 years old and lives in the area in which she was born together with her husband and three children.  They live in a house that she inherited from her parents.\r\n\r\nThroughout her life, Zayda has learned everything to do with working the land and farming.  This is her main source of income, it is what she does and it is part of her life.  Together with her husband, she ploughs the land that they own where they grow corn, beans, potatoes and other crops.  They also plough other areas of land as they sometimes need to produce more.  For this they must extend their sowing.  In addition to this work, Zayda's husband also sells recyclable materials.  This helps them to have other income while they await the harvest season.\r\n\r\nDuring all these years of hard work, Zayda has developed as a farmer with the goal of providing her children with more comfort in life.  She has plans to increase her agricultural production and own animals including cows and sheep.  Zayda has been working with MFP group loans for many years.  She is one of the longest-standing members of her community bank and she considers it to be her best financial ally.  For this reason, she decided to renew her loan (this will be her 15th).

Ever since he left his native village in Bol\u00edvar province, Edenelson has been looking for opportunities to improve his well-being. He found selling sweaters to be one option for earning money initially. This is how he started - with a little capital and a lot of effort. Later, he was able to buy a motorcycle in order to make home deliveries. Now, he uses the motorcycle both to distribute his merchandise and to provide a transport service.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his business life, he came upon many informal lenders and paid expensive interest rates, so that several times he lost money and had to start again because he was very close to losing his motorcycle. Now, this is a thing of the past and he has succeeded in building up a small working capital, which he takes care to protect every day. However, it is a challenge that many times he cannot respond to his customers opportunely because when he sells on credit, he does not recuperate his money quickly enough to do so.\r\n\r\nHe will use this <i>credikiva<\/i> (the first loan he has received through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo) to buy sheets, towels, sweaters, and other merchandise for his most faithful customers.

She has three children, but only her 13 year old son lives with her.  Her other two children are a 20 year old woman and a 23 year old man.  They have their own independent lives.\n\nApproximately eight years ago she suffered through a divorce.  She had to support her three children alone.  That is why she learned the hairdressing and beautician profession.  She now has her beauty station in her own locale. \n\nShe is proud of her effort because she has known how to get her children ahead, and she loves her work.  Her son that no longer lives with her works selling seafood.  He visits her all of the time, and he helps her with some activities in her business.\n\nHer big goal is to buy a new car in order to move around easier and to be able to share more time with her children.  She requested a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in order to improve her business.   She will buy new furnishing in order to attract more customers. That way she will achieve the goal that she longs for.\n\nWith determination this woman has known how to overcome obstacles.  She now very happily tells us that her sacrifices have born fruit.  She practices her profession with great joy, and she is close to her children.  Now, the next step is to improve her quality of life. \n\n\n\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":537.14,"image":{"id":822725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","use":"to buy equipment for her beauty salon.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2011-07-26T19:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1140.91,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":76.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":89.22},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":91.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":92.72},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":94.52},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":97.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":98.23},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100.39},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":104.19},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.36},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.93},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.23},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.28},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.88},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.01},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.19},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.36,"local_amount":76.75,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":77.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797101,"comment":null},{"amount":88.88,"local_amount":88.18,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":88.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608204,"comment":null},{"amount":89.93,"local_amount":89.22,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":89.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562547,"comment":null},{"amount":92.23,"local_amount":91.5,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":92.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773641,"comment":null},{"amount":93.46,"local_amount":92.72,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":93.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182189,"comment":null},{"amount":95.28,"local_amount":94.52,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":95.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263316825,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-08-21T15:19:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":321072,"name":"Sandra Milena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A sus 26 a\u00f1os de edad Sandra se considera una mujer emprendedora que vio la necesidad de generar ingresos ya que es madre cabeza de familia, y es as\u00ed como nace su microempresa, hace 5 a\u00f1os confecciona a terceros y actualmente tiene una l\u00ednea de ropa propia.
