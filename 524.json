C. is 37 years old and lives with a cousin in Suba sector of Bogot\u00e1.  He owns a beauty salon where he offers hair cuts, hair straightening and hair coloring services.  Javier studied accountancy and basic finances when he finished his high school studies but he never worked in the profession.  He started working in a hairdressing salon and stayed there for seven years.  Later, he carried out some specialization courses in hair cutting and nine years ago he decided that it was time to open his own business in premises near to his home.  It was a complete success because he attracted the customers he had when he was an employee.\r\n\r\nCurrently, and above all to do manicures and pedicures, Javier uses the services of a young woman who he pays a percentage of his daily income.  This is the second loan that Javier has taken from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he plans to invest the money in buying shampoo, hair dyes and hair creams wholesale.\r\n\r\nJavier's average daily sales amount to 80,000 Colombian pesos and his profit margin is 60%.  The recent winter season that hit the country led to a reduction in his income.  In the future, Javier is thinking of remodeling his business premises so that he can make his customers more comfortable and so that he can hire another stylist so that he can dedicate himself to selling products in other hairdressing salons as an important laboratory has offered him the possibility of becoming a wholesale distributor.  For now, this is only a project and, until it becomes a reality, this small businessman will continue looking after his customers' hair.  Some of his customers have been with him so long that they no longer need to tell him what hair cut they want him to give

She raises cows and sells the milk that they produce to a local collector who provides this product to a milk processing company. This is an important source of income for her family, so she tries to work hard to maintain the business. In order to optimize her production, she normally feeds her animals natural grass that she acquires from the local farmers. Santos wants to acquire balanced food to help her cows continue to improve the quality of their milk. This investment is very important for her business, since in this season the grass and fodder that she normally feeds them is scarce. Thus, Santos has decided to request a loan of 1000 soles from Edpyme Alternativa, which will allow her to achieve her goal. Santos has already had a loan financed on Kiva through Edpyme Alternativa and Capital Semilla. With that loan, she was able to acquire balanced food to complement the food that she normally gives her animals.

Russia imports fresh vegetables, fruits and dried fruits from Kyrgyzstan, which in turn is dependent on Russian flour and grains. So far the exchange has been successful and both sides are hoping for a bright future of goods exchange. \r\n\r\nShaimkan A., 52, is a treasurer of this group. It\u2019s been 19 years since she and her husband began exporting fresh vegetables and fruits to Russian markets. They have raised two sons and a daughter, who have chosen different professions in life. Their daughter became a professional cook, one of their sons chose electrical maintenance, the other became a musician. \r\n\r\nAfter she was widowed, Shaimkan decided to stop her involvement in international trade and she started working in a local food market. She invested 20,000 soms for a business start-up. Now she earns 17,000 soms in monthly profit and puts this back into goods circulation. Shaimkan joined this group for a loan that would bring changes to her life. She would like to diversify the goods in her shop, and spend the proceeds on purchasing a new house. \r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (being environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAurenila is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Aurenila owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Aurenila has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP monthly.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Aurenila joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. Aurenila is requesting a new loan of 22,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the sixth loan that Aurenila has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

has been practicing mixed farming for the last twenty years in Kisii town in western Kenya. His mixed farm produces maize, millet, cabbages and milk, which are all sold locally. He mainly depends on the income from his farm to meet the basic needs of his family. \r\n\r\nHe recently repaid his previous loan from Juhudi Kilimo of 45,000 KES and has requested this loan of 50,000 KES to purchase a dairy cow. He hopes that this dairy cow will improve his milk production and that he will be able to provide his family with enough milk for both domestic consumption and sale.

She will start selling fresh and frozen fruit and vegetables from her home.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica's dream is to own a store where she can sell household items in the city center.  Her motivation comes from her 3 children: her 20 year-old daughter who is studying speech and language pathology at university, her 16 year-old son, who will help her with her vegetable sales and her 10 year-old daughter.\r\n\r\nFor Mar\u00eda Ang\u00e9lica, Fondo Esperanza has been a great support, not only economically but also through their training sessions which teach members how to run their businesses.  \r\n\r\nVi\u00f1a del Mar is a city and municipality on the central Chilean coast.  It is known as 'The Garden City' owing to the gardens and courtyards that some of the old houses in the city have.  It is also considered the tourist capital of Chile."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":667138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","use":"To buy

In the photo, Marco is in the middle wearing a white cap with sunglasses on top.\r\n\r\nMarco's business is making and selling bakery and confectionery products in his home.  He has been doing this for more than 2 years.  He has also been selling ice cream from an ice cream machine since sales of his baked products fall during the hot weather.  Marco started his own business when he realized, through his own work experience, that a baker's work isn't very convenient.  His wife, who also works with Fondo Esperanza, supports him in his business.\r\n\r\nHe will use his loan to buy mix for his ice creams and cones.  His dream is to own an 'amasanderia' (a type of Chilean bakery).  Marco has two children: an 11 year-old boy and a 5 year-old girl.

Ella tiene en su residencia un taller de modister\u00eda en el cual produce principalmente blusas, faldas y vestidos de mujer. Aprendi\u00f3 ese oficio hace veinte a\u00f1os ayud\u00e1ndole a una amiga en otro taller, luego decidi\u00f3 independizarse y compro su primera m\u00e1quina de coser. Hoy cuenta con una buena clientela formada por vecinos, familiares, amigos y referidos de otros sectores de la ciudad. El \u00e9xito de su negocio est\u00e1 en producir prendas sobre medida, porque seg\u00fan ella, no existen dos mujeres que tengan cuerpos id\u00e9nticos. Adem\u00e1s de confeccionar, la se\u00f1ora Sandra suele aconsejar a sus clientas qu\u00e9 tipo de moda y color es el que mejor se acomoda a su figura. Con los ingresos que genera su negocio aporta a la financiaci\u00f3n del 40 % de los gastos familiares y ha podido sufragar los estudios universitarios de su hijo mayor. Este es el sexto pr\u00e9stamo que tramita con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y planea invertirlo en la compra de telas, hilos y accesorios. Con el  primer  pr\u00e9stamo recibido compr\u00f3 una m\u00e1quina de coser industrial y con el segundo una fileteadora, esto le ha permitido mejorar sustancialmente el acabado de las prendas.Sus ventas mensuales ascienden a $1.200.000 COP y el margen de utilidad es del 45%.  La se\u00f1ora Sandra alterna su oficio de confeccionista con la producci\u00f3n de adornos en cer\u00e1mica. En la decoraci\u00f3n de estos \u00faltimos le colabora su hijo menor en sus ratos libres, ella dice que hay que ser ingeniosos a la hora de generar ingresos porque en materia de trabajo no se pueden colocar todos los huevos en la misma canasta.","en":"Sandra V\u00e1squez L. is 39 years old.  She lives with her husband and two children, aged 21 and 16, in Los Jardines neighborhood, in the city of Cartagena, the most historic city in Colombia which also attracts most tourists.\r\n\r\nSandra has a dressmaking workshop in her home where she mainly makes women's blouses, skirts and dresses.  She learned this trade twenty years ago, helping a friend in another workshop.  She then decided to start working independently and bought her first sewing machine.  Today she has a good customer base made up of neighbors, family members, friends and people from other areas of the city who she has been recommended to.  The success of Sandra's business lies in producing made-to-measure clothes because she believes that no two women have identical bodies.\r\n\r\nAs well as making clothes, Sandra usually advises her customers about what type of fashion and color best suits their figure.  She uses the profits from her business to cover 40% of her family's expenses and she has also been able to pay for her eldest son's university studies.\r\n\r\nThis is Sandra's sixth loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to invest it in buying fabric, threads and accessories.  She used her first loan to buy an industrial sewing machine and her second to buy an overlock sewing machine.  This has allowed her to substantially improve the finishing steps of making her clothes.\r\n\r\nSandra's monthly sales amount to 1,200,000 Colombian pesos and her profit margin is 45%.  Sandra divides her time between her dressmaking business and making ceramic decorations.  Her youngest son helps her to decorate these in his free time.  She says that you have to be clever when it comes to making income because, as far as work is concerned, you can't afford to put all your eggs in one

This town is famous nationwide for its beautiful handicrafts, especially hammocks, backpacks and hats.\r\n\r\nThis small businesswoman has had a dressmaking workshop in her home for thirty years.  She makes dresses, pants, school uniforms, blouses and shirts.  She decorates these last items, embroidering them by hand and sells them for an average of 120,000 Colombian pesos as they require a lot of work.  Elena learned her trade as a dressmaker in her home town when she was very young.  She watched how her mom made dresses and pants for her younger siblings.  At the beginning, Elena used to sew her own clothes by hand, then her father gave her a family sewing machine as a present and she started sewing for other people.\r\n\r\nThis is Elena's first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to invest it in buying fabric, threads, buttons and accessories.  Her monthly sales average is 1,200,000 Colombian pesos and her profit margin is 40%.  During the months of January and February her sales increase considerably as there is a lot of demand for uniforms during the back-to-school season.  \r\n\r\nElena is a widow.  She has four children who all work and help out financially.  Making clothes is a very enjoyable job for Elena and she will continue in this work while she still benefits from good health and embroidering, more than a job, is an activity that she really enjoys doing.  She says with pride that she is self taught.

El negocio comenz\u00f3 hace cuatro a\u00f1os cuando el esposo de la microempresaria qued\u00f3 desempleado luego de trabajar por m\u00e1s de veinte a\u00f1os en el ramo de la fibra de vidrio. En un principio las ventas eran bajas, pero fueron aumentando gracias a la labor de promoci\u00f3n y mercadeo de la se\u00f1ora Fany. Hoy sus productos gozan de un gran prestigio debido  a la calidad de los mismos; son tan buenos que ella otorga dos a\u00f1os de garant\u00eda, mientras que la competencia da s\u00f3lo 18 meses. Los m\u00e1s importantes clientes del negocio son otras empresas que reciben contratos grandes del sector p\u00fablico o privado para construir parques infantiles y ellos a su vez sub contratan con microempresas como la de la se\u00f1ora Fany. Ella es quien maneja la parte administrativa y comercial, su esposo se encarga de la parte operativa, pero cuando los pedidos aumentan considerablemente no es raro verla con guantes y mascarilla pintando con soplete los productos.

Con el primer cr\u00e9dito compr\u00f3 nuevos moldes y herramientas. Cuando los pedidos de piezas para parques infantiles disminuyen, la microempresaria tambi\u00e9n produce guarda barros para autom\u00f3viles, lava cabezas para peluquer\u00edas, toboganes para piscinas y jacuzzis para ba\u00f1os. Ella en general produce cualquier objeto en fibra de vidrio, pero lo que m\u00e1s le gusta fabricar son piezas para parques infantiles porque, seg\u00fan su esposo, eso equivale a producir felicidad a los ni\u00f1os de Colombia.","en":"Fany G.

She has a workshop where she makes products from fiberglass such as slides, tunnels and seesaws for children's playgrounds.\r\n\r\nFany started her business four years ago when her husband lost his job after having worked for more than twenty years in the fiberglass industry.  At first, her sales were low but they increased thanks to her work promoting and marketing the business.  Today her products enjoy great prestige owing to their quality.  The quality of her products is so good that she offers her customers a two year guarantee whilst her competition only offer 18 months.\r\n\r\nFany's most important customers are companies who receive large contracts, in the public or private sector, to build children's playgrounds.  They, in turn, sub contract small businesspeople such as Fany.  Fany manages the administrative and commercial side of the business.  Her husband is in charge of the manufacturing side.  However, when orders increase considerably it isn't unusual to see Fany with her gloves and mask on, spray painting the products.\r\n\r\nThis is Fany's second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to invest it in buying fiberglass, resin, catalysts and paints wholesale.  She used her first loan to buy new molds and tools.  When the orders for children's playgrounds slow down, this small businesswoman also produces mudguards for cars, sinks for hairdressing salons, slides for swimming pools and jacuzzis for baths.  In general, she produces any object in fiberglass but what she most likes making are items for children's playgrounds because, according to her husband, this means they are producing happiness for the

Su inclinaci\u00f3n por el comercio la hered\u00f3 de su padre quien fue lotero en un principio y luego tuvo un puesto similar al suyo en el mismo sector de Chapinero. Otros 6 hermanos del se\u00f1or Jaime tambi\u00e9n son comerciantes. Este es el tercer cr\u00e9dito que tramita con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y planea invertirlo en la compra al por mayor de cigarrillos, chocolates y galletas. De \u00e9sta forma obtiene importantes descuentos por pago en efectivo y volumen de compra. El promedio de ventas diarias es de $ 150.000 COP y el margen de utilidad es del 35%. En un futuro, el se\u00f1or Jaime desea alquilar un local para seguir con su negocio y vender, adem\u00e1s,  desayunos y almuerzos. Este proyecto le permitir\u00eda incrementar sus ventas y mejorar sus condiciones de trabajo, porque a veces sufre por la inclemencia del tiempo como en la reciente temporada invernal. En todo caso, el microempresario se declara un hombre feliz y junto a su negocio hace parte del paisaje Bogotano.","en":"Jaime S\u00e1nchez Q., age 51, lives with his wife and their four children in the city of Bogot\u00e1.  He has a stationary stand where he sells cookies, sweets, cigarettes, soft drinks, and juice.  He also provides cell phone call service.  The business is located in the Chapinero neighborhood close to the Fanny Mickey National Theater.  The theater is famous for putting on the best theatrical shows and musicals in the country.\r\n\r\nThis small businessman has been located in the same site for 26 years.  He is widely known by the workers and people who frequently pass by the area.  He is friends with almost all of his customers.  He chats with them about the day\u2019s news while he sells them refreshments or gives them a match to light a cigarette.  When he sees a suspicious car or person, he does not hesitate to tell the private watchmen in the buildings that are nearby.  He does this so that the watchmen can report it to the police.\r\n\r\nHis work day starts at 8:00 a.m., and it ends at 7:00 p.m.  He got his propensity for business from his father.  In the beginning his father sold lottery tickets.  Later, his father had a stand similar to the Jaime\u2019s stand in the same area of Chapinero.  Six siblings of Jaime are also merchants.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He plans to use the loan to buy wholesale cigarettes, chocolates, and cookies.  This way he gets important discounts for paying in cash and buying in volume.  His average daily sales are 150,000 COP; and his profit margin is 35%.\r\n\r\nIn the future Jaime wants to rent a place to continue his business and to sell breakfast and lunch.  This project will allow him to increase his sales and improve his work conditions.  He sometimes suffers due to inclement weather like the recent winter season.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this small businessman says that he is a happy man.  Together with his business, he is part of the landscape in Bogota.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":684071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"To buy wholesale cigarettes, chocolates, and cookies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T15:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T09:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":65828.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427767,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":65828.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001206,"comment":null},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":65828.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289229,"comment":null},{"amount":33.72,"local_amount":61314,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":64578.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157367,"comment":null},{"amount":35.03,"local_amount":63686,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":67077.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230377,"comment":null},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":65828.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509241,"comment":null},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":131656.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673462,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-03T23:32:48Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":262762,"name":"Lucila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cTARPUY\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

She studied up to high school level and has her high school diploma.  She lives in Ahuehueyo, in the town of Ciudad Ayala, in the State of Morelos, in Mexico.\r\n\r\nMargarita has a business selling clothes and gifts.  She also sells (Jafra) perfume through catalogs and plastic products.  She will use her loan mainly to stock her business with merchandise such as men's and women's clothes.  She will invest in a (Jafra) perfume order, purses, leather bags and will also stock her business with toys for 'Kings Day' (January 6th - when children receive gifts from the Wise Men).\r\n\r\nMargarita found out about Kiva loans through a friend who invited her to take part in a group and decided to request support to set up her own business since she used to work as an employee.  Margarita has had her business for 25 years.  She started selling door to door and gradually attracted more and more customers until she decided to set up a sales location in her town.  She started out selling (Jafra) perfumes through a catalog and then leather bags that her sister brought her from Toluca.  She also brought shoes because they are cheaper there.\r\n\r\nSomething else that favors Margarita's business is the fact that she pays a very low rent on her business which is in Ahuehueyo market.  Her husband also supports her financially.  Margarita doesn't have far to travel from her home to her business since it is only two blocks away.  This means that she can walk.  Margarita's business is very important to her as it makes her the money she needs to cover her needs and, for that reason, she tries to benefit from it as much as possible.  Margarita likes selling and she normally works until 3.00pm every day.  It makes her very proud to have many customers of all ages who she sells to for cash and on credit.  She normally re-invests her profits in buying more merchandise.  She would like to expand her business, buying another two display cases so that she can display more merchandise and make better profits.\r\n\r\nMargarita is married.  Her husband is a construction worker and they don't have any children.  She occasionally receives help from her dad who has medical problems with his vision.  She comments that she likes her neighborhood a lot because it is very quiet.  Bad things don't normally happen there and the landscape is very green.  Margarita tells us that Kiva loans are very good and she mentions \"it is good that they keep lending to us\".  She will make her loan repayments on time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":680935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy clothes, blouses, Jafra perfumes, bags and leather purses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SAN JUAN AHUEHUEYO","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T18:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":12000,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":292.5,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:45:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3618.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430784,"comment":null},{"amount":195,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2412.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850043,"comment":null},{"amount":195,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2412.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292316,"comment":null},{"amount":195,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2412.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160581,"comment":null},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1206.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233489,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-12T04:14:52Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":262786,"name":"Maria Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cURPI\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

T. lives in Ahuehueyo, in Ciudad Ayala, in the State of Morelos, in Mexico.  She is 51 years old and lives with her common-law husband.  She has six children.  Three of her children are here and three live in the United States.  33 year-old Ca\u00edn is married, 30 year-old Adriana is single, 26 year-old Marcela is married.  These three children are working in the United States.  16 year-old Ra\u00fal is studying at CECYTE - Colegio de Estudios Cient\u00edficos y Tecnol\u00f3gicos (College of Scientific and Technological Studies), 13 year-old Antonia is in high school and 12 year-old Abdiel is in high school.\r\n\r\nPaula has a business selling chickens whole or in pieces.  She also sells soft drinks, fried pork rinds and tostadas (fried tortillas).  She is requesting this loan to buy chicken, fried pork rinds, soft drinks and some metal sheets for her wall.\r\n\r\nPaula started out in her business 8 years ago.  The business belonged to her daughters but they went to the United States to work and left her the business.  The chicken salesman used to come to offer his chicken for sale and pay her daughters for selling it.  Then her daughters took over.\r\n\r\nOn Saturdays and Sundays Paula sells chicken 'mixiotes' (a traditional, pit-barbecued meat dish) and breaded roast chicken.  She started her business with a 1,000 peso loan and she invested it in buying merchandise.  Her business is located in her home and it is important because it makes her money to send her children to school.  It also pays for tickets, shoes, school uniforms, gas and water.\r\n\r\nPaula likes selling chicken because they are ready to sell every day.  She takes her chickens at 6.00am, she cuts them up and is ready to serve her customers who are family members, neighbors, acquaintances, ladies and gentlemen.  She uses the profits she makes in her business to cover her children's school expenses and she would like to buy bags so that she can give her customers a little bag of sweet treats at the New Year and on Valentine's Day.\r\n\r\nPaula would like to build a new wall and roof so that her premises look better because her current wall is made from metal sheets.  She plans to achieve this goal using her profits and the money that her daughters send her from the United States.  Her business has helped her family and continues to help, covering her children's school expenses.\r\n\r\nPaula's dreams are to fix up her house, building new walls and a new roof to complete it.  She is very happy to be receiving this loan which they are giving her to stock her business so that she has merchandise to offer her customers.  The improvements that she would like to make for her son are to open a bank account.  Although her son is still very young, he has bronchial asthma.  Paula plans to achieve her goal by continuing to make her chicken sales and saving her profits.\r\n\r\nPaula would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Thank you for the help that you give me and while I continue selling my products, if it is possible, I would like you to continue helping me with loans\".  Paula likes Ahuehueo because she was born there.  They celebrate San Juan on two dates.  On February 18th and June 24th there are masses, a procession and three days of bullfighting."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":681120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy chicken, fried pork rinds, soft drinks and metal sheets for her wall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SAN JUAN AHUEHUEYO","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T19:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":247.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3061.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430785,"comment":null},{"amount":165,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2041.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850044,"comment":null},{"amount":165,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2041.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292317,"comment":null},{"amount":165,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2041.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160582,"comment":null},{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1020.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233490,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-09T01:12:05Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":262790,"name":"Emilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esta persona se llama Emilia Mart\u00ednez M. tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en la localidad de Tenextepango, municipio de CD.

She is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad mainly to buy supplies for her business such as flour, turkey, cold meats, chilis, ham, sausages, almonds, nuts and pineapple.\r\n\r\nEmilia has a bakery business in her neighborhood where she sells: sweet bread, 'teleras' (Mexican flat bread), bread rolls, white bread, etc.  She has been in her business for a year.  She learned to make bread because her dad taught her when she was a young girl.  She later taught her husband to make bread and he now makes the bread and she sells it.  This business has helped her with all her expenses, in paying for food and in paying for her children's schooling.  She inherited the premises where her business is located from her dad and although her business is well established, she also goes out to sell her products in Ahuehueyo, in the market.  It is 5 minutes from her home.  She travels there in a truck.  Emilia's business is important because it is how she supports her family.  She tells us that she likes making bread and that the work is very satisfying, for example when people tell her that her bread is very tasty.  She says that she serves on average 50 - 80 people a day.  She offers her customers baked turkeys and legs of meat at Christmas and New Year.  Some of the challenges that she has faced in her business have been the rise in prices for her raw materials such as sugar and flour and also the rise in competition.\r\n\r\nEmilia generally re-invests her profits in her business which makes more profits.  In the future, she is planning to expand her business, setting up another bakery.\r\n\r\nEmilia is married and has two children: 8 year-old \u00c1mbar who is in elementary school and 2 year-old Yael.  Her husband helps her make her bread and she is proud to be following her dad's tradition as he was a baker.  She is planning to grow her business in the future and she would like to set up another bakery.  This will make her more income and she will be able to get her children ahead in their studies.  Emilia would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"thank you for the loan but I expected that you would lend me a larger loan amount\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":680360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","use":"To buy flour, sugar, eggs, salt, turkeys, cold meats, ham, sausages, almonds, nuts, pineapple and cherries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TENEXTEPANGO, CD AYALA, MORELOS","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T20:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1855.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430786,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1237.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850045,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1237.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292318,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1237.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160583,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":618.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233491,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-04T07:52:47Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":262791,"name":"Veronica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cNUEVO AMANECER DE URUBAMBA\u201d; Este banco est\u00e1 ubicado en la provincia de Urubamba, departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra: Veronica La socia tiene 35 a\u00f1os de edad, la socia es conviviente y tiene 3 hijos, la socia trabaja administrando su restaurante de nombre las Brizas, ella  trabaja directamente con los almuerzos, las extras y viendo todo el men\u00fa del d\u00eda, la socia tambi\u00e9n apoya en las mezas y la atenci\u00f3n directa de los clientes, la socia es una mujer muy trabajadora y viene siendo parte de este banco comunal desde hace 4 a\u00f1os, la socia aprendi\u00f3 a ahorrar y a producir ella ahora requiere el pr\u00e9stamo para as\u00ed poder implementar su restaurante y comprar los productos b\u00e1sicas que salen a diario como es el aceite, el arroz, az\u00facar, harina fideos y otros y poder abastecerse y comprar al por mayor, la socia desea poder comprar los productos para continuar con su negocio de restaurante.

Algunos de los problemas que ha enfrentado su negocio es que a veces las personas la piden fiado y se atrasan en sus pagos cuando son las clausura de terminaci\u00f3n de clases o el d\u00eda de muertos y se atrasan porque usan el dinero para otros gastos, pero poco a poco le van pagando y as\u00ed recupera lo que invierte.

She is 41 years old and didn't finish her basic education through lack of financial resources as she had to work from a young age to help support her family.  Antonia sells products through catalogs.  She will use her loan to buy perfumes and cosmetics from catalogs (Jafra, Avon, Fuller).  She sells her products from house to house.  The products she sells most of are: perfumes, creams, utensils, make-up sets, lipsticks, eye liners, blusher, etc.  She has been in her business for 10 years.  At the beginning, her business was difficult because she had to supplement her income washing for other people or selling other types of products such as fruit and vegetables since initially her catalog sales were very low.  However, she gradually increased her number of customers and started committing herself solely to selling perfume and other items through catalogs.  She tells us that at the beginning necessity forced her to increase her sales as she was left alone with her children and she had to earn more to get them ahead in life.\r\n\r\nAntonia currently continues to make her sales from house to house but she has a good customer base and her income is secure each week.  She only works within her neighborhood.  She walks from house to house offering her products for sale.  This business activity is very important for her because it is how she makes her income to support her family.  The part of her work she enjoys the most is showing her catalogs to her customers and persuading them to buy her products.  She feels proud to be making the income she currently makes.  Thanks to her business, she has been able to get her children ahead in life without neglecting them.  She personally serves her customers who are young people and adults who buy her products and she is pleased that her business is well known by the people in her community.  Sometimes her children help her to deliver her orders.  One of the problems that Antonia has faced in her business is people who ask to buy on credit and then don't make their repayments on time.  For example, when there are graduation ceremonies or people are celebrating 'D\u00eda de los Muertos' (Day of the Dead), they delay their payments because they use the money for other expenses.  However, they pay her back bit by bit and she recovers the money she has invested.    Another challenge she has faced in her business is the competition from other people who make catalog sales but she already has a customer base tnanks to her good customer service.  She normally uses the money she makes to feed her family and to cover her children's school expenses.  In the future, she plans to set up a display window and display her products in her home.\r\n\r\nAntonia is single and has 4 children: 19 year-old Constantino who works, 16 year-old Agust\u00edn who works, 13 year-old Leonardo who is in high school and 22 year-old Patricia who is married.  Her children also help her in her business, delivering her orders.  Antonia would like to use the profits from her business and her Kiva loans to put a new roof on her house and to extend it, building two more rooms.  Her dream is for her business to remain stable and to increase it so that she has a well-established business.  She feels happy to be receiving this loan because it will enable her to achieve her goals and increase her sales.  Antonia would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Thank you for putting your trust in me and I hope not to let you down.

She is 52, married to a surveyor, and they have 5 sons and daughters: Leonardo, 32 who is an engineer, Juan Carlos, 31 who is in information technology, Dulce Mar\u00eda, 30, who is in public relations, Israel, 26, who is an economist, and Rodolfo, 15, who is studying in the CBTIS of Ciudad Ayala.  Ver\u00f3nica finished basic education and studied to be an executive secretary.  She will use her loan to supply her business. She is going to buy patented pharmaceuticals.  She began with KIVA loans and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad through the invitation of a friend. She has a pharmacy in her neighborhood, and she also sells patented pharmaceuticals, perfumes, baby clothes and gifts.  Her business is called Farmacia (Pharmacy) Mega and she has had  it for 15 years.  Previously she worked in a pharmacy in Cuautla.  People who knew her suggested that she open a pharmacy in her area until finally, with the help of her sister, they established the first one.  Between the two of them they handled the business and then she helped her sister open one for herself.\r\nThey also had a restaurant in the area but they closed it because they couldn\u2019t find people who knew about the business.\r\nShe rents a store that is 200 meters from her house and every day she walks over to her business.  She considers her business very important because she gets to meet and talk with many people, it serves as a distraction, and she earns money.  What she most likes about it are the sales.  From the time she was little she sold from her mother\u2019s house.  It was a big lot and there were many fruit trees.  She would gather the fruit  from the trees in a basket and go out to sell, and then she would give the money that she made to her mother so that she would buy something delicious to eat.  When she was 14 she was buying soft drinks and selling them outside of her mother\u2019s house.  Later \u201cI went to Jalsico and began to buy blankets, sheets, cushions, and napkins that I could purchase very cheaply and I would make good money when I went to Zapata park in Cuautla  to sell the merchandise\u201c.  \r\nShe has always liked sales. She gets a lot of pleasure from her work because she can buy what she likes and she is proud to say that it has moved her sons and daughters ahead and helped them study for careers in the university.  Her regular customers are her own neighbors.  On the average she sees about 20 to 30 people  of all ages every day.  Her customers buy from her because they know she treats them well and that is why her business is known throughout the area.  Now there are two other pharmacies that have opened there  but they don\u2019t really affect her business.  She uses the money that she makes mostly in keeping up her medicine supply, to pay the rent, and to pay an employee. She will use the KIVA loan to buy patented pharmaceuticals and to purchase a showcase for the stuffed animals that she sells for gifts.  She has her plans and hopes to builf her own pharmacy so that she won\u2019t have to pay rent any more. The best will be that her youngest son continues studying and have a career.

A. lives in the town of Moyotepec, municipality of Cd. Ayala, in the state of Morelos, Mexico. She is 41 years old. As a girl she studied basic education in primary school and finished high school in the INEA open system after marriage. She is going to use this loan principally to buy consumable products for her business: a griddle to toast pumpkin seeds, a gas grill, string cheese, tomatoes, chiles, sugar, tamale leaves, butter, meat, and chocolate.   \r\n\r\nMs. Antonia hopes to use a part of the loan to carry out some improvements to her home which will allow her to improve her business. Specifically, to put down a hard floor in the kitchen of her house. She has a business which sells tamales, atole (a maize drink), and toasted and ground pumpkin seeds for green mole\/pipian (a sauce for stewing). She started this business 10 years ago when necessity obliged her to take on an economic activity. She learned the trade from a cousin of her husband who taught her how to make tamales. Before dedicating herself to tamale sales, she had other activities; selling fruit and vegetables door to door, and selling hand-made tortillas and picaditas, and her business was going very well. As well, she sells mangos and grapefuit when in season.\r\n\r\nHer business is not fixed. She sells door to door on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays in her community. Her work, although heavy as she does it on foot, is important because it helps her to get her children ahead in school and with the household expenses. She enjoys the tasks of her trade, such as browning the seed and preparing the tamales. A big satisfaction she gets from her business is always having money for her necessities as well as for her pleasure. A moment of great pride for her was when, with some savings from her work, she bought material to plaster the walls of her house.    \r\n\r\nHer business principally helps housewives who, when they don't prepare something to eat, buy her products (tamales, mole, picaditas, etc.) We mention that on average she serves between 50 and 60 people. Some of the challenges she has confronted in her business are the constant rise in prices and harsh weather. \r\n\r\nMs. Antonia points out that her business is very important to her because it has helped her and her children to get ahead and she would like that through her work each day is better with her family and that they don't lack anything. She is pleased to receive this loan and feels a large responsibility to repay it. Ms. Antonoa wants to say to Kiva \"thank you very much for having confidence in me and giving me this loan because it is a big help for my business and for my family. Also, it gives me easy repayment terms and small interest.\" She likes her community because from here on clear days you can see the volcano (popocatepetl) and the hills, and it is open country. \r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":681224,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy a tortilla griddle to brown the seed, a gas grill, leaves for tamales, chiles, butter, cane, Oaxaca cheese, sugar, chocolate\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T21:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":1125,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1159.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430793,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":773.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850051,"comment":null},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":773.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292324,"comment":null},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":386.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160589,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-04T04:09:52Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":262802,"name":"Leticia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Leticia T.

Mart\u00ednez lives in the City of Moyotepec, located in the state of Morelos, Mexico.  She\u2019s 35 years old, has completed junior high school and has her diploma.  She runs a business where she rents out tables, tablecloths, and chairs and will use the money from this loan to buy more tablecloths to grow her business.\r\n\r\nShe found out about Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad through a friend who invited her to participate in a local group.  Her business is called \u201cCasa Vargas,\u201d and she and her husband have had it for eight years.  When they returned from working in the United States eight years ago, they didn\u2019t know how to invest the money that they had.  A friend told them that it would be a good idea to invest in tables and chairs to rent out, so they acquired the items they needed to start the business.  Before starting this business, [Leticia] had sold clothing, but that business was not in her best interest.\r\n\r\nShe runs the business out of her home, where she attends to the customers and her husband delivers the tables and tablecloths in his van.  She considers her business to be very important because it provides the money for their major expenses, as well as for their daily ones.  The biggest challenge is in servicing large contracts because it is a lot of work.\r\n\r\nThey are proud that their business is recommended more and more as time passes, and people come from all around, even from other towns, to rent from them.  A special moment for her was when they bought their first tables and chairs to rent out.  They used them for their three year old son\u2019s birthday party.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that her business is popular because, even though people come from far away, they give good service at good prices.  One of the problems they face is that sometimes the customers lose the items and they have to charge them.  They don\u2019t have any competition in the local area, so it makes things easier.\r\n\r\nShe believes that in the future they will buy more items for their business; round tables and seat covers, so that they will look more presentable, and feels that she will be able to do it from the extra income facilitated by this loan.\r\n\r\nLeticia is married and her husband works as a private English teacher.  She has two children; nine year old Sergio who attends elementary school, and three year old Cynthia.  Her husband helps by delivering and picking up the tables.  She thinks that her business is important because, even though they invested a lot of money up front, it now provides them with a good income.  She tells us that she wants to add a second floor to her home, complete with more bedrooms for their kids.  Her hopes are that they can provide an education for their children through their business and effort.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that when she gets the loan she feels very happy and committed because she knows that she needs to invest in her business, give better service to her customers, and repay her loan.  Leticia wants to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cIt\u2019s great that you loan the money because the interest is low and you help the businesses.\u201d  She likes Moyotepec, the place where she lives, very much because the landscape is very peaceful, one can see many trees, and the people there raise corn and sugar cane.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":681187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Tablecloths","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Moyotepec, Ayala, Morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T21:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":7000,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":215.63,"local_amount":2625,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2667.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430794,"comment":null},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1778.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850052,"comment":null},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1778.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292325,"comment":null},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":889.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160590,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-04T02:16:54Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":262803,"name":"Hortencia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Hortencia  Dom\u00ednguez  Ram\u00edrez vive en la comunidad de Moyotepec  municipio de Cd.

She is 61 years old and studied two years at elementary school.  Her business is selling soft drinks (Coca Cola, Pepsi, Jarritos, etc.) and candy.\r\n\r\nHortencia started her business 12 years ago.  She started her business when she bought her first refrigerator.  She decided to sell soft drinks after one of her daughters held a religious celebration in her home.  She had candy left over and she gave it to her mother to sell.  Also, one of her children who went to the United States helped her, sending her money to invest in her business and to build her house with.  With their help, she grew her business which she considers very important because her sales provide her with enough money to support herself and she doesn't have to go asking for money.  She also feels great satisfaction because the money she spends is hers and she doesn't owe anybody anything.  She is proud of the fact that, through her work, she has been able to tile her house roof and she has been able to build some small rooms that her husband, who is a builder, helped her with.\r\n\r\nHortensia's customers are mainly her neighbors and people who pass by.  She serves, on average, 10 to 20 customers a day.  One problem that she  has faced is the increase in competition from the ladies in her town who also sell candy.  Hortensia re-invests her profits back into her business, as well as using some to pay for food.  She is planning to expand her business, putting another table outside her house and stocking more products such as cracklings (pork scratchings), candies and cookies.  She tells us that another difficulty she faces is that, during the cold season, she doesn't sell as many soft drinks.  However, she says that it is during this season that KIVA loans help her to get ahead in her business, improving her sales.\r\n\r\nHortensia has three children: 37 year-old Gabriela, 32 year-old Teresa and 23 year-old Isa\u00edas.  Her daughters help her, giving her money to invest in her business whenever they can.  She considers that her business has helped her a lot because when her daughters were studying she was able to pay for their transportation and school expenses.  Hortensia's plans for the future are to finish off her bathroom and her kitchen, laying tiles.  She would also like to install a sink in her kitchen so that she doesn't have to go out to the yard, especially during the cold season.  She feels happy to be receiving this loan because, for her, it represents a great help in getting herself ahead in life on her own.

She is asking for funds to buy chicken.  She started the business 7 years ago due to need because her husband\u2019s earnings didn\u2019t go far enough.  The locale where she sells is located downtown and she rents it; the rent se pays to the helper is low.  When she started her business she\u2019d get the chicken in the morning and she\u2019d have to pay for it in the afternoon.  Her business is in downtown Ahuehueyo, two blocks from home.  She walks to work.\r\n\r\nHer business is very important to her because that\u2019s what provides for her family.  Her favorite part of the business is when sales happen because then she has money and that gives her much satisfaction and pride for being able to get ahead, when she is able to buy the things her children ask for.\r\n\r\nHer customers are her friends, neighbors, housewives and domestics.  The products she offers her customers are whole chickens and chicken parts, chicken filets.  Her business is popular thanks to the good customer service she provides; when the customers come by she already has their orders ready for them to pick up and when they have parties they order the chicken from her.\r\n\r\nHer business faces competition from chicken shops nearby.  She uses the profits for her children.  She\u2019d like to have a place to keep live chickens and earn better profits; she expects to accomplish this through hard work.\r\n\r\nHer business has helped her economically to meet her children\u2019s educational expenses so that they can continue in school.  Her plans and hopes are to see her business grow and increase sales.\r\n\r\nShe is happy with this loan she got because it will provide her with the opportunity to acquire her chicken and provide better customer service.\r\n\r\nThe improvements she hopes for the future are that her children stay in school so that they will prepare themselves to be people of importance some day and she aims to accomplish this with help from the loan she\u2019ll use for her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":684222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":" To buy live chickens and at wholesale to sell whole or in pieces.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SAN JUAN AHUEHUEYO","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T20:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":2700,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2783.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430796,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1855.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850054,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1855.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292327,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1855.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160592,"comment":null},{"amount":75,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:45Z","rounded_local_amount":927.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233493,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-09T20:19:37Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":262805,"name":"Ramiz","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Ramiz G. rodilsya v 1955 qodu.

R. lives in the Moyotepec community in the city of Ayala in the state of Morelos, Mexico.  She is 42 years old, and she has an elementary school education.  She will use the loan to increase the inventory in her business.  She started her business two years ago in her sister\u2019s house.  There is a soccer field in the Abelardo neighborhood, and the players asked if she sold water or soft drinks.  \r\n\r\nShe then decided to make a small investment to establish a stand, and she started to sell water and soft drinks.  Her sister lent her the space that she currently uses.  It is on the side of the soccer field in the Abelardo neighborhood.  She opens it on Saturdays and Sundays.  Sometimes her sister\u2019s children help her take care of the business during the week. \r\n\r\n Before she sold food she sold shoes by catalog.  She did not like this business activity very much because she had to walk a lot, and in her new business she is not as tired.  She is going to use the loan to buy soft drinks, bottles of water, snacks, juice, and sweets.  She sells these the most.  It takes her ten minutes using public transportation to get to her business.\r\n\r\nShe feels that her business is very important because her work gives her enough income for her living expenses.  In addition, it gives her great satisfaction to run her own business.  Also, through her business she knows a lot of people, and they all treat her respectfully.\r\n\r\nIn her business she primarily waits on the players, their families, and the fans that go to the games.  One of the challenges that her business faces is the growing competition, which has caused her sales to drop.  She uses the income from her business to invest in more products for her business.  She also pays for the utilities at her business and her home.\r\n\r\nShe plans to buy different products than the ones she sells in order to have more variety in her business.  Her future plans are to set up her business like a grocery store and to increase the number of customers she has.\r\n\r\nTomasa is married, and her husband is a bricklayer.  They have three daughters.  Rub\u00ed is 17 years old, Yesica is 22 years old, and Jazm\u00edn is 20 years old.  As two of her daughters are married, they keep house and are not able to help in her business.  Her youngest daughter goes to school.  Sometimes her nephew helps her take care of the business during the week.  On Saturday and Sunday she personally takes care of the customers.  \r\n\r\nMoyotepec is a peaceful village with fields.\r\n\r\nTomasa wants to say thanks to Kiva and to the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cI am grateful to those who are able to help us improve our businesses with this loan.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":684261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"To buy soft drinks like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Jarrito, Squirt, Mirinda, and bottles of  purified water and sweets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Moyotepec, Ayala, Morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-04T19:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":243.75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3015.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430797,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2010.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850055,"comment":null},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2010.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292328,"comment":null},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1005.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160593,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-05T00:12:36Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":262817,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elizabeth, de 38 a\u00f1os, vive en la casa de su madre al lado de ella y de sus  2 hijos menores; juntos se esfuerzan cada d\u00eda por salir adelante en busca del progreso.

She started her business on her own initiative since she wanted to support her husband with their household expenses and provide their children with the best possible education, which is the most important thing.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Sonia re-invests the money she makes in the business since there are clothes that run out very quickly and her customers ask her for them.  She doesn't like to have to disappoint them, telling them that she doesn't have them.  Her biggest dream is to expand her business over time so that, through her business, she can get her family ahead in life which is the most important thing for her.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Sonia's group is called \"Ejidal\" (Co-operative).  The reason behind the name is that where the group members live, there is a co-operative building.\r\n\r\nThe people who make up this group are:\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Sonia V. Dom\u00ednguez, who will invest her loan in buying clothes to sell in the town\r\n\r\nOlga Lidia V.

She sells women\u2019s and men\u2019s shoes on Saturdays and Sundays in Axochiapan\u2019s main square.  She has had this business for three years.  She used to sell food in the same stand in the market but she was told that selling shoes was a better business and she decided to change the nature of her business.  Her son helps her by taking her to buy shoes in Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, M\u00e9xico.\r\n\r\nShe started the business investing the money she had saved in a tanda (an association formed upon a core of participants who agree to make regular contributions to a fund which is given in whole or in part to each contributor in rotation) and set up shop in her house.  She decided to invest her money in shoe sales because she commented that she\u2019d rather earn profits with her money than spend it.  Her favorite part of the business is watching her money grow rather than spending it and that she can run her own business.  Some of the challenges she has faced is the increase in competition because there are a lot of shoe stands in the market.  Besides, sometimes the inclemency of the weather prevents her from selling.  She will use the Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad loan to buy more shoes in a style that people will buy more of.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rosal\u00eda M. is married.  Her husband is a farmer.

Her business has helped her get ahead with her household expenses and to enlarge the business.  Plans for the future include planting some farmland she has in the local farming area.\r\n\r\nShe is happy to get help from Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to reach her goals.

In addition to basic items, she sells sodas, snacks, toys, and gifts for all occasions.  Her store is called \"Tienda Mary\" (\"Mary's Store\").  She has been in business for 20 years.  She tells us that she started the business out of necessity upon becoming a widow, when she had to provide for her children.  She began by doing washing and ironing, but as this did not bring in enough, she decided to learn to make cheese and cream.  The family's economic situation became bearable when she decided to also sell a few groceries outside of her house on a little table.  Bit by bit, she added more products.  She bought a refrigerator and began to sell sodas, and in this way her business grew.  Later, a neighbor told her about the loans from Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, and she thought it was a good opportunity to give her business a bigger push.  Afterwards, she bought the land where she currently lives and where she has her business.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a widow and has 4 daughters and 1 son, all married and independent.  They help her by giving her money periodically for her expenses and sometimes they invest in her store.  She is full of pride at the fact that everything she has she acquired with the fruits of her labor, and therefore she enjoys serving her customers each day and doing all of the tasks needed in her store.  On average, she has 50 customers a day.  She thinks her business is profitable because her customers find everything there, and because she provides them with good service.  One of the challenges facing her business is the increase in competition, but she notes that even with everything, she is doing well.  She normally invests the earnings from her business in more merchandise, and she is planning to enlarge her store by buying more display cases to exhibit more merchandise and serve her clients better.  She plans to achieve a significant part of those plans with loans from Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  \r\n\r\nShe likes her town a lot because, as she herself says, \"...that's why I like my town (Axochiapan), because it's a place for businesses, everything one could offer is for sale...\"  She is happy about the granting of the loan because it will enable her to achieve her goals.
