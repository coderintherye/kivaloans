","en":"This group is called \"EL RINCONCITO\" (The Little Corner).  It is located in the community of Emilio Portes Gil, San Felipe del Progreso.  This community is noted as being different from others because a lot of its residents are professionals.  Most people have university degrees and are teachers.  There are a lot of university students and students in general.\r\n\r\nThis group has 4 members.  It is a small group.  There used to be more people in the group but they decided to take a break for a while and then continue with the group later.  The members are all neighbors who have known each other for years.  They say that the group is called EL RINCONCITO (The Little Corner) because that is what the area they live in is known as because they live in a corner of their community.  Of the group's 4 members, 2 are women and 2 are men.  Their names are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.-Raymunda M. M..  Raymunda is 55 years old and a saleswoman.\r\n\r\n2.-Ebelia C. G\u00f3mez, 50 years old.\r\n\r\n3.-German R. R., 49 years old.\r\n\r\n4.-Margarito G\u00f3nzalez T., 45 years old.\r\n\r\nThe four members of this group are salespeople.  They sell cleaning supplies and plastic products.  They use carts which they load with merchandise and then go out to sell in different places on market days.\r\n\r\nRaymunda M. is the group's treasurer.  She is 55 years old and she works as an itinerant street vendor, selling trays, creams, razors, bath sponges, etc.  She makes her sales on Fridays and Sundays.  During the week she serves in her grocery store.  She is requesting her loan to restock her store with merchandise and, in this way, make money from both businesses.\r\n\r\nOne of Raymunda's challenges is her sales.  They are not as good as she would hope for.  There are some days when she sells very little and she becomes exasperated.  However, she reinvests the little that she earns in her business and continues working.\r\n\r\nRaymunda's family is quite large.  She has six children: five daughters and one son.  One of her children is married.  The others work.  Only one of her children is still dependent as he is studying and would like to finish his studies.

owns a flower shop in northern Israe,l which also caters to special events and celebrations. She is the mother of four grown children with a business with huge potential. Terese is the backbone of her family and her flower and specialty shop makes it possible for her to earn a living with respect. Terese studied and worked in events planning and tourism and then worked within the educational system for years teaching music. In the mid 1990's, Terese opened her flower shop. At the same time, her husband was advancing as a tractor trailer driver. Unfortunately, hard times hit and the family suffered from an investment scam, which took them years to recover. Terese has kept the shop going and in recent years, she and her husband are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nTerese needs this loan to open a satellite location that is needed for special events. Funds will be used for plants, flowers and site setup to meet the high demand for special events and celebrations.\r\n\r\nWith the extra business coming in for celebrations and special events, Terese has hired a part-time sales person and assistant. In the future, she wants to hire two full-time employees to meet business needs and expand sales and her net

F. was born in 1967. He is married and the father of four children, all below the age of 15.  He and his family share three rooms in Njianga Quarters, in Nsongwa village mile 90 Bamenda, North West Region, Cameroon.\r\n\r\n<p>E. has encountered a lot of difficulties in life, the most profound being the death of his parents while he was still very young. As a result, he was unable to educate himself nor to have three square meals a day. Ill health has also been one of his problems. He has been unable to have good medical treatment because he has no money. Since he has joined GHAPE, he has seen the following changes in his life: sending his children to school, affording three square meals a day for his family, encouraging capital for his business and paying his hospital bills without a lot of difficulty.\r\n\r\n<p>With this loan of 200,000 XAF, E. will increase his capital and buy farm tools, piglets and pig feed. The manure from the pigs will be used to farm vegetables, some of which he will sell. His community and family will benefit from the vegetables, manure and meat when the pigs are edible. His activity will help reduce distance from members of his community and will be available at all times. E. says, \u201cMy children will all be well educated.\u201d He will use the profit from his business to educate his children, increase his capital and provide basic needs for himself and for his family. He prefers GHAPE because of the training and follow-up he frequently receives. He appreciates that GHAPE does not ask for collateral securities and that it provides low cost loans, with gradual payments.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":689892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy

The most difficult have been the problem of paying for her house rent and building a house of her own.  She plans to invest this loan in frying akra beans, gateau, sales of row food stuff, purchase of sugar, palm oil, groundnut oil, salt, flour and some plates. She believes the business will succeed because she has been in the business for a long time. She also thinks her approach to her customers will be captivating and hence lead to the success of her business. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford at least three meals per day at affordable prices.\r\n\r\nAlice will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her house rent and save for rainy days. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Today, Azimjon finds himself in need of purchasing cattle in order to be able to take advantage of raising and selling them when necessary. For this reason, Azimjon is obtaining loans from IMON International in order to obtain these animals and raise them so that in time they can be used to support his family.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in Ndamukongstreet, a quarter in Bamenda, Northwest Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nAnye has faced some challenges in life. Amongst which are the inability to meet the basic necessities of his family like clothing, food, transportation and educating himself and his children. He has had difficulties in raising capital to start up a small business to sustain him and his family. He plans to invest this loan in a gardening business, and with this loan he is going to buy seedlings and farm products. He believes the business will succeed because the previous loan he took was repaid by the income raised from an old farm of his; therefore, he concludes that he is sure the business will succeed. He is also certain that this business will succeed because the products he produces are highly demanded in the market. The loan will help his community because they will be able to afford all food ingredients at low or no cost. \r\n\r\nAnye will plough back his profit into his business and use part to care for his family. He also will use the proceeds to pay his children\u2019s school fees and cater for the family.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.

K., a hardworking gentleman in the cattle-raising business, is married and works hard to provide for his two children.  Presently, Rashid is making sacrifices and working hard to grow his business, and now is requesting a loan to purchase calves to raise. His goal is to maximize returns from the sale of milk products. This will be Rashid's fourth loan with IMON and Kiva, and his credit history shows that he is qualified to receive the loan.  <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes its role as a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need. <p>\r\n\r\nTo learn more about IMON International's work, please visit:

S. was born in 1954 and has four children, two of them under 15. She works hard for herself and her children, having been abandoned by her husband. With the death of her first son, she was obliged to work very hard to support the rest of the children, only possible with more income, which motivated her to join GHAPE. With this loan, she plans to carry out mixed farming and increase her business selling bananas, fire wood, and palm oil. With the profit from this business she plans to buy a plot of land and build a house.\r\n\r\nPhebe will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to expand her business and save for rainy days. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE: The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":210,"image":{"id":689972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"yam

Kamoliddin was born in 1964 in Gonchi, Tajikistan where he works as a farmer. He is married and has two children. His main business is farming and cattle breeding, which provides him with the means to meet the needs of his family. Kamoliddin owns a large piece of land where he cultivates different kinds of vegetables, but due to the poor quality of the soil and the insects, he is no longer able to satisfy market demand. Very hard-working, he is asking for a loan of 10,000 Somoni to buy seeds, fertilizer and cattle. The loan will greatly improve Kamoliddin\u2019s income and his family's living standards. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She shares six rooms with her children and grandchildren in Bamenda, North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nShe has encountered many difficulties in life including the failure to attain a quality education due to the untimely death of her father, and that of her husband in 2006, which has put her into her present state of trying to support her family. In addition, thieves broke into her home and made off with valuable materials and, in 2000, her house collapsed because of heavy rain and wind. With the many problems and the children under her care, she has still been happy because, among  the widows in her area, she is one of those who gets help from GHAPE solving her problems. If given another loan of 400.000frs, she plans to buy day-old chicks, seedlings, and fertilizer. She is convinced that the business will succeed because a previous loan from GHAPE was successful. The loan will help her community because she will be able to provide general food provisions so they will not need to incur transportation costs to buy in distant places. \r\n\r\nShe will plough her profits back into her business and use part to care for her family, pay for her children's education and upgrade her standard of living. Sthe also hopes to open a workshop for her son.\r\n\r\nShe prefers GHAPE because of the training she receives, the follow-up, and that GHAPE does not ask for collateral, as well as the low cost of obtaining and paying back a loan. \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE: The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is 34 years old and didn't finish her basic education.  She studied up to the 5th year of elementary school.\r\n\r\nAvigail owns a grocery store and she will use her loan to acquire merchandise (general groceries) to stock her business.  She has a grocery store in her town and the main products that she will buy are: oil, sugar, trays of eggs, soap, snacks, soft drinks, bottles of water, bleach, toilet paper, etc.  Her store is called \"Abarrotes Amilcingo\" (Amilcingo Groceries).  She learned the business through necessity as she had to cover her family's expenses.  Her business is an inheritance from her in-laws who passed it on to her husband.  Her business is located in her home which means that she doesn't have to travel.  This situation is very convenient for her since she thereby also has time to look after her housework.  \r\n\r\nAvigail's business is important because it supports her family and she enjoys serving her customers.  What she is most proud of is knowing that her business is making progress.  Avigail serves between 40 and 50 people of all ages.  One of the challenges she has faced in her business is the economy (there is little money) and the competition.  This has affected her income and sometimes she can't manage to stock her store well.  However, she continues to provide essentials.  A further problem she faces is the rise in the number of grocery businesses in her town.  She is requesting this loan so that she can offer more products and buy wholesale so that she can provide her customers with goods at better prices.\r\n\r\nAvigail is married.  Her husband works with her and helps her to serve in the store.  He sometimes also goes to do the shopping.  Avigail has three children and they all live with her.  Her children are: 17 year-old Lucas who is studying for his high school diploma, 15 year-old \u00c1ngel who is in high school and 13 year-old Kimberly who is also in high school.  They all help with the business and thereby increase their income.

E. lives in the community of Amilcingo Temoac in the state of Morelos, Mexico. She is 37 years old and she completed primary school. She is married and she has 4 children: Uribe is 22 years old and he is employed; Alexander is 20 years old and he is employed; Cesar is 14 years old and he is in high school; and, Yadira is 5 years old and she is in preschool. \r\n\r\nRutila has a taco stand named \"Taqueria el Fongocito 3\" and she sells tacos, shish-kebab, and hamburgers. With her loan she will purchase meats, vegetables, and natural gas in wholesale to supply her stand. She started her business 3 years ago. She was once employed in a taco stand from where she learned to prepare the foods and to manage the business. She and her husband worked hard to have a business together until finally they reached their goal. She is very proud to see her 2 eldest children work the business with her, to have their own source of income. \r\n\r\nThe business is located in Jonacatepec. She rents the location. It takes 20 minutes to reach the business from her home when she takes public transport.  Her business is important, especially for her family and other families, as it provides employment to others. \r\n\r\nHer clients are families, young adults, and seniors. She attends to 80 to 100 clients every day. Her business is very popular for the tasty tacos they produce. The challenge that she faces is the weather. When it rains there are many less clients. The sidewalk floods and they usually set tables there.\r\n\r\nThe earnings from the business are invested in the purchase of merchandise. When there isn't enough money she is able to get things on credit, giving her a week to pay. Her plans are to expand her business and to include more items in the menu and if they are popular, to keep them in the menu. \r\n\r\nHer business is a great help to her family, for the education of their children, and for their expenses. She wants to carry out some improvements to her home and to build houses for her children and their families. She is very excited to have this loan because it is a new way to support her business.  She wants to create a business for each of her children. Rutila wishes to convey to Kiva and to Fundacion Realidad (Kiva Field Partner) the following message: \"the loan that you have granted me is a great help to me. I will invest in my business. Thank you very much\". \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":687570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase ingredients for her restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"morelos","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-11T17:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rutila Regina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1222.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430823,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1222.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850076,"comment":null},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1833.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292350,"comment":null},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1222.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160608,"comment":null},{"amount":50,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":611.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233496,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2011-01-12T13:45:12Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":264396,"name":"Janice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janice T. is from the village of Plaridel.

Amilcingo is a pretty town, and she is happy living here.  Most of the inhabitants make sweets.   \r\n\r\nThe improvement she wants to make to her house is a hallway.  Her hopes and dreams are to have another house, another bathroom better than the one she has, and to make her house bigger.  What she wishes for her children is that they keep going to school, that they have a career, that they become better people, and that they have good health.  She plans to achieve this by using the loan for supplies and by working and making the sweets to sell.\r\n\r\nAlfreda wants to tell Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cThanks for doing me the favor of lending to me.

She is 85 years old, and she did not go to school.  She will use the loan primarily to invest in the peanuts and corn that she has planted in the area\u2019s fields.  She also plans to pay the workers that she has at her service.  Also, she will buy food for four piglets that she is fattening.\r\n\r\nShe has been farming for 11 years, and she says that the loan from Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad have greatly helped her; it especially helped increase her business activities.  She tells us that she previously only worked with crops together with her husband.  But, her work has been increasing, and now she even contracts workers to help her.\r\n\r\nShe used to sell traditional sweets at the fairs or in the Ozumba and T\u00e9tela del Vulcan plazas.  She sold \u201cpalanquetas\u201d (similar to peanut brittle), amaranth candy, and tamarind candy.  However, now that she is elderly she prefers not to leave her area.\r\n\r\nThe land where she currently lives and has her crops is an inheritance from her husband.  Normally she goes in her own van to the crops.  Sometimes she also uses this form of transportation to stock her business with merchandise.  Her grandchildren are the ones who help her work in the field.  She personally feeds her pigs.  She tells us that her family likes her business and helps her a lot with the work.\r\n\r\nHer work is very important to her because that is how she supports herself and her family.  It is also important because her work contributes to the maintenance of the fields in her area.  She likes to plant and to see how her plants grow and give fruit.  She always has some product in her house like peanuts, corn, or amaranth.\r\n\r\nHer customers are wholesalers who at harvest time buy her complete production for seed.  She also saves some sacks to sell to her neighbors in the area.  She reinvests her earnings in her crops by purchasing fertilizer or paying to prepare the fields.  Her future plans are to buy two more pieces of land for the next planting season and to introduce sorghum.  Some of the repairs that she has made to her house are expanding the kitchen and putting potable water in her house.\r\n\r\nForentina is a widow.  She has two daughters, Aurora and \u00c1ngela.  They both live with her and participate in the field work with their mother.  Her grandchildren also live with her, and everyone participates in the field work.

is a married woman who lives in Bogo City, Cebu. She earns her living by fishing. Her husband, Ronaldo C., who is 37 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 12 and 15 years old. The children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business.\r\n\r\nAlma joined Kiva partner NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Alma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her sixth loan she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to buy fishing nets and equipment so that she can continue to save up for a future house renovation.\r\n\r\nAlma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is 38 years old, married and supports her family by operating a general store. She lives in Bogo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000. Herminia is borrowing PHP 20,000 to purchase more stocks to sell.  This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Herminia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is 25 years old, married and supports her family by operating a business buying and selling livestock. She lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her buying and selling of livestock business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Marilyn is borrowing PHP 13,000 to fund operations.  This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Marilyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

P. is from the village of Dalig Viejo. She is 61 years old. Visitacion is married and has 7 adult-aged children. To make a living, Visitacion owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising pigs. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Visitacion has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Visitacion joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Visitacion has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Visitacion is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the 12th loan taken out by Visitacion from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Jean has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Jean joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jean has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Jean is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Jean from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.
