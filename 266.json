One of her dreams is to modernize her small workspace and stop making her products the old-fashion way as she has been doing. Her customers are satisfied with her products because her marzipans' taste, size and price are incomparable.

T. is from the village of Camanga, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 35 years old. Juvy is married and has five school-age children. To make a living, Juvy owns and operates a business in a food market, selling vegetables and spices in the local community. Juvy has been in business for over one year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Juvy joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juvy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Juvy is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Juvy from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general her family's living conditions and pay the school tuition of her five children.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":377376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Esmeralda is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Esmeralda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the her children and for daily needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

Six years ago he decided to start up his own business because he was about to lose his job. For this reason he bought a photocopier to provide this service to his neighbors. Later he had the opportunity to take his business to a school, so he bough another photocopier and set up a small kiosk offering snacks and refreshments. \u00c1ngel is very pleased with his achievements, but even so he took another job as a security guard, which he does every morning. His wife then tends to the kiosk and copier at the school in the mornings, and \u00c1ngel does it in the afternoons, leaving his eldest child in charge of the copy machine he has at their home. In this way everyone does his or her part to help the family make headway because they know together, with a lot of hard work and dedication, they will achieve their goals. This is the sixth loan for \u00c1ngel with Kiva partner MFP, and during his previous loans he has always shown himself to be very responsible with his payments. With the money he is requesting, he plans to purchase paper and office supplies so he can start selling those items in both his home and at the school, and thus increase his profits.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":378085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","use":"Purchase paper and office supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-27T04:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":317.34},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":332.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":351.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":366.95},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":380.97},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":398.7},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":421.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":431.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.7},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.05},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.32},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.99},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.9},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.39},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":105.78,"local_amount":317.34,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":318.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081248,"comment":null},{"amount":110.7,"local_amount":332.11,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":333.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997398,"comment":null},{"amount":117.05,"local_amount":351.15,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":352.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842743,"comment":null},{"amount":455.85,"local_amount":1367.55,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1374.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734324,"comment":null},{"amount":131.56,"local_amount":394.68,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:28Z","rounded_local_amount":396.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992388,"comment":null},{"amount":79.06,"local_amount":237.17,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":238.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717227,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-30T04:12:49Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":132755,"name":"Eden","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eden P. is from the city of Oroquieta.

Ar\u00edstides has always enjoyed cooking, and that's why she decided to start her own business. She had no hesitation in choosing a food stand, although many times she did not have enough to tend to all her customers.

Debido a que \u00e9l es chofer y trabaja durante casi todo el d\u00eda, Judith debe afrontar el cuidado de sus hijos, lo cual realiza por las ma\u00f1anas, y su trabajo a partir de las 6 de la tarde hasta las 10 de la noche. A Judith le gusta mucho su negocio porque siempre le gust\u00f3 cocinar, lo \u00fanico que no le gusta es tener que dejar a sus hijos solos dentro de la casa durante este tiempo, pues est\u00e1 muy ajetreada con la atenci\u00f3n de sus clientes. Su deseo a futuro es tener una tienda en su misma casa donde pueda trabajar con mayor comodidad. Este es su sexto pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, ella es una persona muy estricta a la hora de cumplir con sus pagos, al igual que el resto de integrantes de su grupo, con el cual se siente muy contenta, porque todos son buenos amigos. Con el dinero que viene solicitando comprar\u00e1 mayor cantidad de papa, litros de aceite y otros ingredientes para aumentar las porciones de salchipapa que vende."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":378089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"Compra de comestibles e ingredientes para sus comidas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-27T00:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":105.65},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":110.57},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":116.91},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":122.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":126.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":132.74},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":140.22},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":144.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.98},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.7},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.92},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.76},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.39},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.98,"local_amount":105.65,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":111.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081250,"comment":null},{"amount":38.7,"local_amount":110.57,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":116.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997400,"comment":null},{"amount":40.92,"local_amount":116.91,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":123.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842745,"comment":null},{"amount":159.36,"local_amount":455.3,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":480.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734326,"comment":null},{"amount":74.04,"local_amount":211.57,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":223.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992389,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-27T02:13:05Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":132761,"name":"Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marina tiene 37 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo, Esteban, y sus hijos Alex de 13, Yoiri de 6 y Brigitte de 2 a\u00f1os y medio, todos viven en su casa propia.

For a living, she sells food such as deserts, empanadas, \u201csalchipapas\u201d, and chicken soup at a small stand that she has in the Jerusal\u00e9n market, one of the most well known in her district.  Her husband Esteban also works, but he doesn\u2019t have a fixed job which is why Marina\u2019s work is so important to the household.  In addition, at her food stand, she sells dolls and makes handicrafts to earn extra income.  Marina is attentive to her customers and has gained many friends and new customers, which is the best part of her work.  Marina has been in this business for 17 years and wants to continue to progress.  Her future desire is to have a restaurant which specializes in barbecued chicken.  Although she knows it is good to dream, she thinks that there is a long road ahead of her before she gets there.

Z. is from the village of Mansabay Bajo, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental. She is 59 years old. Sylvia is married and has ten adult children. To make a living, Sylvia is starting a business venture in the agriculture sector raising pigs for sale. Sylvia is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sylvia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sylvia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Sylvia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase piglets to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Sylvia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

This loan will be the third loan taken out by Jay from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":377360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is 46 years old. Evilia is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Evilia owns and operates a sari-sari, or general store. She sells daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc., in the local community. Evilia has been in business for over 24 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Evilia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evilia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC. Evilia is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Evilia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":377522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

C. is from the village of Gango Rizal, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 32 years old. Roselyn is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Roselyn makes and sells food. The main source of income for the business comes from preparing and selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Roselyn has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 3,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Roselyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Roselyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the first loan taken out by Roselyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and for daily allowances. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

years ago, Bella started having her own business. She joined ASHI then to be able to loan for a business capital which she used for starting up her hog fattening business and to be able to finance her manicure and pedicure business which she learned when she was six years old. Having her own business, her husband's sporadic income being a farm laborer will be augmented to be able to meet the daily needs of their three children who were in school. Sometimes Bella sells food in their neighborhood for n additional income because profit from her businesses alone can not supply the increasing demand of her family. Her eldest child, 21 years old hadn't even graduated from high school and her second child, 19 years had only graduated from elementary. It was a many years ago that Bella's two elder children stopped from going to school. During those years, Bella was not yet a member of ASHI and didn't have her own business. Now, through she requests from ASHI, she will be able to enhance her businesses to be able to finance the education of her nine year old youngest child until graduation in college. \nPresently, Bella requests for a much larger loan to be used in growing her hog fattening business (pig raising) and to be able to purchase a manicuring set to be able to generate daily income. Hog fattening business grows fast given enough business capital since the profit from it is as much double the amount of it capital after four months of fattening the pigs. Selling hogs in larger volume would really generate bigger profit. This is what Bella looks for in every loan she requests.

A. is from the village of Gango Rizal, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 39 years old. Gina is married and has one school-age child. To make a living, Gina makes and sells food. The main source of income for the business comes from preparing and selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Gina has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Gina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Gina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Ice Plant, Brgy. Sebucao, San Enrique, Negros Occidental since birth.  She is now 42 years old and is married to Teodoro T. who works as a baker in one of the bakeries in Bacolod City.  They had 3 daughters but unfortunately one died because of an illness.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 and had her first PHP 3,000 loan which she used as additional capital in her food vending business. But the main purpose for why she joined was the insurance coverage that all NWTF-Project Dungganon members enjoyed -  she knew that her family would benefit from such coverage.\r\n<p>\r\nEdelyn knew how precious such security would be to her family because at the time that she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, she was already burdened with the health problems of her youngest child. The hardship and heartache she experienced with her child's medical difficulties did not hinder her from exerting more energy to sustain her food vending business. Instead it gave her the strength to continue moving on for she knew that NWTF-Project Dungganon would be her only refuge in her mission to improve her family's standard of living. Sometime in 2006, in spite of their best efforts, her youngest daughter died as a result of her lingering illness and the family was left deep in debt. But, Edelyn still remained active with the loan with no delayed payments.\r\n<p>\r\nYears later, when she could borrow a bigger loan, she decided to venture into a different business activity.  That is when she started her \"Sari-sari,\" or general store business.  With the help of her Dungganon loans, her businesses enabled her to buy and renovate the house they were living in, which she was only renting before, have water connected to it, buy furnishings and appliances, and send her 2 surviving children to college. In the 6 years that she has been a Project Dungganon member, Edelyn can proudly testify that NWTF not only helped her through all the hardships, but also continues with her on her journey as she walks away from poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nFor her 11th loan, Edelyn is borrowing PHP 19,000 to continue expanding her business activities so that she can secure the future of her 2 surviving children and continue to improve the quality of life for her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":378283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is married and has 5 children. He was unemployed without a way to sustain his family, so he looked for a way to start his own business to be able to face his costs. With much effort Toir initiated his own business with very little merchandise. Selling foodstuff, little by little he was able to maintain his home and start to grow his business, incorporating the sales of grocery items, and improving the quality of service he offered. Toir needs a loan of 8000 Somoni, which he will use to provide more foodstuff and continue to work hard to sustain his family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

F.'s loan from ASHI is a great support to her fisherman's husband and in his fishing business. A year after Grace's first loan from ASHI which she used for her fish selling, rice and food spices retailing business, she was able to request for another loan much larger than her first one to be used for her husband's fishing business. By then, they were able to purchase their own fishing boat. Grace fish selling business thereafter had grown. However, income and profits she makes are insufficient to cover all the expenses her family daily lives require in addition to her business capital requirement. Grace has to increase her profit by growing her businesses more to be able to send all of her three children who age from two to 19 to college until graduation. Therefore to be able to attain her aspiration Grace is requesting for another loan since she had paid up the whole she loaned previously. She wants to use her loan for another business which is hog fattening (pig raising) and financing her husband's fishing business to sell more fish. With hog fattening, profit is as much double than the amount of its capital. With this, Grace hopes to be able to purchase another fishing boat and to become a wholesaler of food spices in the

C., 35, is a young widow from a village called Pulong Saging (Banana Island) in Silang, Cavite.

But it is her apartments that give her a steady monthly income, covering all their family\u2019s basic needs, including the children\u2019s education. She earns at least 50,000 Philippine pesos a month from seven apartment units, which only started out as two apartment units prior to her joining the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2005.  \r\n\r\nShe was able to buy a second-hand car and was able to renovate her apartments out of her profits from the business. She has just finished repaying her previous loan with the cooperative and has applied for a new one in the amount of P47,000.  She needs the funds to complete the renovations of all of her seven apartment units to attract good renters.  \r\n\r\nNova believes in the value of education, that\u2019s why she works hard to see her children finish their college education.\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social-development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n

L. is from Brgy. Lopez Jaena, Sagay Sity. She is 52 years old and married with three children of adult age. She joined the project in 1994 and started a small general store in their community.  \r\n\r\nThe 15 years that she has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon has made a marked improvement in her life. In her last loan, she borrowed 22,000 Philippine pesos, which she invested in the vulcanizing shop managed by her husband. It is now earning PHP 5,000 per month. This time around, she is planning to invest the PHP 22,000 she is borrowing to use as capital to buy and sell feeds in her general store as an additional source of  income.   \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc., has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":378292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

G. is a 49 year old businesswoman who loves to multi-task.  Her husband Conrado, 52, works as a driver for a well-off family in Pasay City.  They have four children, one is in college, two are in high school and the youngest is in elementary school.  \r\nWilfreda has a general store.  Much of her time and effort is focused on this business, but she also manages rooms for rent, which she leases out to transients and student boarders.  In her spare time, she sells cosmetics and apparel on an installment basis to clients.  All these business activities give Wilfreda a sure income of almost P15, 000.00 a month.\r\n\r\nShe joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2003.  She has learned from the cooperative the value of saving for the future.  She knows how important it is to have money in reserve, especially in emergencies.  She wishes to see all her children finishing their education.\r\n\r\nWilfreda applied for a new loan with the cooperative amounting to P19, 000, as additional capital for her businesses.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n\r\n

B., 36, is a multi-skilled businesswoman who lives with her 3 children in Barrio Filipino, Don Carlos, Pasay City.  Her husband Hacer, 42, is a computer programmer.\r\n\r\nVilma loves to multi-task and she earns a lot from it.  She manages a general store located just in front of their house, and  also manages a fleet of 4 pedicabs.  She also rents out a room next to their house to transients\/boarders.  Combined, from all  these businesses she earns at least P18, 000 net income a month.  \r\n\r\nShe joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2006.  She has been praying fervently for the restoration of her family which was almost ruined by a third party. She is thankful for the spiritual comfort the staff of the cooperative has provided her all these years.  \r\n\r\nVilma needs a new loan in the amount of P32, 000, which she will spread to all her businesses for expansion.  She has been planning to move to another place (Antipolo, Rizal) and venture into farming.  She also wishes to own a taxi or a jeepney someday.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

This will be their first loan from Kiva and SMT. With this loan, they will be able to improve their businesses so that sales and profit will also improve for them. The loan will help these people to look after themselves, feed and clothe their children, and pay their children's school fees. \r\n\r\nJatu S. (left) is the leader of this group. Jatu is thirty years of age. She was born in a village called Maroki about seventeen miles from Makeni, but now lives in Masorie Village with her husband and four children.

With this loan, some of the staff members will start a small business and those who are already running small businesses will invest the loan into their business. Some of the staff members will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children\u2019s education or pay for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home-building projects.\r\n\r\nSixty-two year old William B. C. (back row, third from left) is the head teacher at the school. William has been a teacher since 1964. He was born in Yelle village about thirty-three miles from Magburaka town, in northern Sierra Leone. He is married with ten children.

She has one child and a second child who is due any day.  She lives in the town of Picoy in her own house, one-half hour from the city of Tarma.  Despite her pregnancy, she cultivates and harvests her crops and also tends to her cows daily and sells the milk in the city market.  The majority of her income is derived from the cultivation of vegetables; therefore, she does not fail to cultivate and water her seedlings, and, as a result, harvests in only three months the expected produce, such as carrots.  When she harvests her produce, she also sorts it by size and washes it in the irrigation ditch of her town, so that later, generally on Tuesdays at three in the afternoon, she takes it to the most important market in the city of Tarma, where it is chosen by the buyers who pay the best prices.  For this reason, Rosmery likes to sow all types of vegetables which permit her to profit in a short period of time.\r\nThis is her thirteenth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she has never been late in making payments on her previous loans.  In addition, when it is her turn to host her group in her house, she prepares the traditional spicy meat stew to share with her companions in the cooperative bank, who she holds in high esteem.

Por ello, es muy amable con todas las personas que visitan su tienda y con el pasar del tiempo han aflorado sus habilidades de persuasi\u00f3n y convencimiento para la venta. En el transcurso de este tiempo ha notado que ha ganado muchos clientes, en especial de las zonas netamente agr\u00edcolas, donde se consume mayor cantidad de fertilizantes y pesticidas.

She lives in a house with her mother and since her one-year-old daughter Danitza was born, she has faced her responsibilities alone.\r\nPreviously, she engaged in various activites, but, unfortunately, she had no success until her uncle, an agronomist and owner of a farm supply store, transferred the business to her with an agreement that she make installment payments to him over a specified period of time.  Since then, Zulma has put much effort and dedication into her work; she understands that customer service is very important in business.  Therefore, she is very kind to everyone who visits her store and, with the passage of time, her ability to persuade and to make a sale has surfaced.  In this time period, she has noticed that she has acquired many customers, especially from areas that are actually agricultural, where a large quantity of fertilizers and pesticides are used.\r\nFor this reason, Zulma has turned to Microfinanzas Prisma for her thirteenth loan.  She has been very responsible with her past payments and, additionally, in her position as treasurer of her cooperative bank.  The five hundred twenty-five dollars she is requesting will be used to increase her business capital.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":378448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","use":"Increase of business capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-27T18:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zulma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":229.01},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":237.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":245.47},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":254.14},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":263.11},{"due_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":271.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.99},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.92},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.95},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.08},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80.15,"local_amount":229.01,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":237.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081255,"comment":null},{"amount":82.99,"local_amount":237.11,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":245.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997405,"comment":null},{"amount":85.92,"local_amount":245.47,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":254.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842750,"comment":null},{"amount":275.94,"local_amount":788.41,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":816.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734331,"comment":"Over-reported by partner.

Lilia has been a garbage collector for five years now and is proud of it.\r\n\r\nLilia\u2019s work and source of livelihood is maybe menial to some but for her it is her source of wealth. She collects garbage by making daily rounds from village to village mounted on her pedicab, fetching each household\u2019s rubbish. Before dumping everything in the city\u2019s waste disposal facility, she salvages anything recyclable and of value and turns it into cash by bringing it to a junk shop. After she\u2019s done with her daily routine, she tends her sari-sari (general) store where she sells toys and other fun items for children. She earns more than P15,000 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nLilia joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2004. Her previous loans with the cooperative have been a big help in her business. She was able to purchase an additional pedicab which she uses in garbage collection. She now employs the services of one of her sons.\r\n\r\nLilia applied for a new loan with CCT in the amount of P36,000 to purchase a bigger pedicab for the expansion of her garbage collection operations. She also plans to use some of the loan proceeds for the renovation of their house.\r\n\r\nIt has been Lilia\u2019s long sought after dream to have her own house and lot including her own junk shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About CCT<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

He lives together with his two sons, with whom he has assumed the role of father and mother owing to his separation from his wife.  His dream to educate his children led him to put together his own locksmith's shop, in which he has worked for more than 10 years.  He began the shop with the support of some friends, who helped him to get his first customers.  He now has two shops and a good number of customers who frequently solicit his services.  This profession enables him to continue improving his economic income, and it is for this reason that one of his goals is to install his locksmith's shops in commercial zones, where the shops' locations would generate increased earnings.  However, in order to achieve this goal, he must keep a watchful eye on his two locations; to help him try to do this, he relies on the assistance of his sons and father to keep the shops running smoothly.  To be able to expand, he must improve the quality of the labor at his shops. To do this, he requires various tools that he has been waiting to modernize, since the ones he has are all worn out and need replacing.  This is his first loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA, for which he promises to be responsible with his payments and toward the institution.  The 2500 soles that he is requesting will permit him to buy the tools and materials required for him to complete the remaining jobs he has yet to complete for his customers.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":378462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","use":"Compra de materiales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-27T18:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":171.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":177.68},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":181.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":190.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":194.79},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":201.85},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":214.06},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":216.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":226.99},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":232.1},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":241.94},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.23},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.62},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.92},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.26},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":850,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2516,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081256,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2009-08-28T21:16:20Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":132906,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 50 a\u00f1os, vive con su hijo en la casa que hered\u00f3 de sus padres y donde tambi\u00e9n habita junto a sus hermanos.

B. is from the village of Dela Paz, Clarin, Misamis Occidental. She is 35 years old. Resma is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Resma operates a business running a general store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Resma has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 1,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Resma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Resma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Resma is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Resma from PMPC.

She is very good at keeping daily records, and says \"My plan is to have my own home.\"\r\n\r\nEnkhsaikhan requests a 1,300,000 tugrugs loan to purchase more supplies so as to expand her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":378810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"To

As  result  of his hard work, he owns two cars. He drives one of the cars himself, while he leases the second for 150,000 (approx. $ 104 USD) tugrugs per month.  He earns between 15,000-20,000 ( approx. $10-14 USD) tugrugs per day from his taxi business. Tserenbaljir plays the morin khuur,  a mongolian traditional two- stringed musical instrument, and  he plans to work as a musician some day in the future. Tserenbaljir  is requesting a 1,500,000 tugrug (approx. $690 USD) loan to purchase tires for his vehicles and to renovate his house.

C. is from the village of Tungawa, Tambulig, Zamboanga del Sur. She is a 51-year-old widow and mother of three adult children. To make a living, Remedios operates a general store selling soft drinks and daily use products.   She has been in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nRemedios recently joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Remedios is requesting her first GDMPC loan, for 5000 PHP, to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

F. of Sitio Gaboc, Barangay Odiong, Moises Padilla, Negros Occidental is 49 years old and married with 9 children ranging in age from 9 to 25.  She joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in August of 1998, after a friend invited her, and with the first PHP 3,000 loan she borrowed she was able to revive her barely surviving \"sari-sari\" or general store. Profits from her loans allowed her to buy appliances and furniture, and to make house repairs.\r\n\r\nSubsequent loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon allowed her to invest in ducks and she saved the profits until she was able to buy a carabao which she rented out. Today she has several bulls, one cow, and several heads of pigs, and the \"sari-sari\" or general store is also performing well.  Now Aleja wants to borrow PHP 19,500 to buy more cattle to expand her herd.  Aleja is doing all this so she can provide her children with a good education and secure their future.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":378939,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To

D. T. of Barangay Biak na Bato, La Castellana, Negros Occidental is 40 years old and married with one child.  She operates a general store where she sells the usual groceries and commodities as well as frozen food and even ready-to-wear clothes. She joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 and the loans she has had access to have made a great impact on her business. Now she can even sell some of her products on credit to her neighbors because she has enough revolving capital. Allowing her neighbors to buy goods on credit and pay her back on an agreed-upon date has enabled Annaliza to have an edge over her competitors, and increased her income capacity.  Now on her 8th loan cycle, Annaliza is borrowing PHP 18,000 which she intends to use as a revolving fund for her store. Annaliza's dream is to provide her child with a good and comfortable future.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

is Vilma H., 36 years old, from Malibay, Pasay City.  Her husband Eric, 39, is an auto mechanic.  They have three school-aged children.\r\n\r\nVilma sets up a table in an alley near their house and sells food items which she herself cooks every day.  She also serves fruit shakes of different flavors.  She makes good sales every day primarily because of her business location.  She earns at least P13,000.00 a month.  Recently, she added selling French fries.  At times, she also provides home-based manicures and pedicures services to customers, which is another sure source of additional income for her.    \r\n\r\nShe joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2003 and has since been enjoying the many benefits it provides for its members.  Vilma has applied recently for a loan from CCT for P15,000 for expanding her business.  \r\n\r\nVilma works hard because she wants her children to finish school.  She hopes to formalize her stall into a full-blown restaurant someday.  She also dreams of having her own parlor.        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents Family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":379043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","use":"For

Norma B. is a resident of Carmen Annex, Ozamiz City. She is married to Rosendo B. and has four school age children.\r\n\r\nMrs. B.\u2019s husband is a tricycad driver. A tricycad is a bicycle with three wheels which is commonly used for transportation here in downtown Ozamiz City. He is also engaged in green algae culture, which in Filipino native language is known as \u201cguso\u201d- a green algae or seaweed. Mrs. B. also sells snack food in her neighborhood on Sundays but their daily source of living comes from her husband\u2019s tricycad operation for which he earns Php 300 per day.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. joined PMPC in 2006 and her first loan was Php 3,000 which she used as additional payment of the tricycad which she had bought. Right now she is applying for her 8th loan in the amount of Php 14,000 intended to purchase spare parts and pay for repairs to her husband\u2019s tricycad.\r\n\r\nMrs. B.\u2019s future plans for her family are to be able to send her four children to college and to be able to make a comfortable house since they are living near the seashore and, during high tide, the water gets inside their house. She is hoping and praying that through the help of PMPC and Kiva lenders she will fulfill her future

For over fifteen years he has been doing this activity. He began working with his brother when he was eight years old and he worked with his father in the bakery that they currently own. He would like to also mention that their daily work begins early in the morning. At two in the morning they begin to make the bakery items. They need to have their products finished before daybreak so that they can deliver them to various businesses in the neighborhood. These businesses sell the baked goods that are sought after by many customers.

She intends to use the profits for her family's daily needs and to set aside a certain amount for the future security of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"39-year-old Gulmira R. has three children. Her eldest son, 17, lives in a village with his grandmother. Her second son is 15 and her daughter is just four and half years old. Her and her husband hold interesting occupations as toastmasters in various feasts and banquets during weekends. Previously, her husband used to work in an entertainment centre; now he is an art director in a vocational school. \r\n\r\nThey have already taught the basics of their occupation to their middle son. Now he occasionally assists them during banquets. They enjoy doing their job because it provides an income and gives them a lot of free time during the week. Saving little by little, they have able to buy audio equipment and speakers. They understand to survive the competition they constantly have to seek ways to improve the quality of their services. Gulmira hopes to obtain a loan to buy a video camera as it has become essential to organize feasts and parties. In the near future, they plan to organize a band and buy sound equipment for their son so that he is able to work separately. \r\n\r\nGumira has three loan partners: Gulsaira, Zinagul and Maria. Gulsaira, 42, is a widow with two children. Since the collapse of Soviet Union she has been engaged in commerce near a hospital. Now she plans to sell foodstuffs at school. She needs a loan to purchase goods and foodstuffs in order to increase turnover. With the return, she would pay for her daughter\u2019s education. \r\n\r\nZinagul, 44, is a mother of five children. Besides being a housewife, she helps her husband raise the livestock. Zinagul needs a loan to buy a milk cow in order to sell milk.\r\n\r\nMaria, 50, is married and has six children. Her husband and son raise cattle while she manufactures traditional articles. In her spare time, she helps her husband look after cattle. Maria wants to obtain a loan to open up a shop as there are few of them in the area.\r\n \r\n  ======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).
